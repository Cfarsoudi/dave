                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                           1993

                

               INT. CAVE NIGHT

               There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and 
               acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one. 
               It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH 
               in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool 
               of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse 
               that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE.

               INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we 
               can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished 
               passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on 
               its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE.

               ONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a 
               series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in 
               hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the 
               CREVASSE.

               THE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of 
               rock from the cave.

               The earth begins to shake.

                                     THE CHART KEEPER
                         She is restless tonight.

                                     ANOTHER INDIAN
                         She dreams of loving.

                                     STILL ANOTHER
                         She has the blues.

               View of the chartkeeper's drawings. One is of a crane with a 
               very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked 
               girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out 
               from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human 
               proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this 
               drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the 
               finishing touches on the drawing.

               And the song "Happy Birthday to You" strikes up on country 
               and western guitar and polka-like accordion. title

                                        BIG THUMBS

               INT. RICHMOND VIRGINIA SUBURBAN HOME DAY

               We see CANDLES burning on a cake. It is somebody's birthday. 
               And there are six candles on the cake.

               SISSY HANKSHAW is six years old.

               Her DADDY and a visiting UNCLE, finishing their rendition of 
               Happy Birthday, are staring down at Sissy and looking at her 
               young THUMBS, WHICH ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE and twitch with a 
               mind of their own.

               She manages to blow out all six candles.

                                     UNCLE
                         Well, you're lucky that you don't 
                         suck 'em.

                                     DADDY
                         Sissy couldn't suck 'em, she'd need 
                         a mouth like a fish tank.

               Sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake, dropping 
               it because of her thumbs.

                                     UNCLE
                              (agrees)
                         The poor little tyke might have a 
                         hard time finding herself a hubby. 
                         But as far as getting along in the 
                         world, it's a real blessing that 
                         Sissy's a girl-child. Lord, I reckon 
                         this youngun would never make a 
                         mechanic.

                                     DADDY
                         Nope, and not a brain surgeon, 
                         neither.

                                     UNCLE
                         Course she'd do pretty good as a 
                         butcher. She could retire in two 
                         years on the overcharges alone.

               Laughing, the men walk to the kitchen to fill their glasses. 
               Sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her cake.

                                     UNCLE (O.S.)
                         One thing, that youngun would make 
                         one hell of a hitchhiker...

               This startles Sissy. A new word that tinkles in her head 
               with a supernatural echo. Sissy looks at her thumbs.

                                     UNCLE (O.S.)
                         ...if she was a boy, I mean.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE DAY

               Dr. Dreyfus looks over Sissy's thumbs.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         She is, if I may speak frankly, 
                         somewhat of a medical oddity. Due to 
                         impaired dexterity, her life 
                         activities and career potentialities 
                         will be reduced. It could be worse. 
                         Bring her back to me if there ever 
                         is pain. Meanwhile, she will have to 
                         learn to live with them.

                                     MRS. HANKSHAW
                         That she will. That she will. The 
                         Lord made them things big for a 
                         purpose. God don't never git tired 
                         of testing our kind. It's a punishment 
                         of some sort, for what I don't rightly 
                         know.
                              (whimpering)
                         Oh Doc, if a young man ever shows up 
                         here with, a young man with ugly 
                         fingers, you know, something similar, 
                         a similar case, Doc, would you 
                         please...

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         Remember the words of the painter 
                         Paul Gauguin, dear lady. "The ugly 
                         may be beautiful, the pretty never." 
                         I don't suppose that means very much 
                         to you.

                                     MRS. HANKSHAW
                         It's a judgement. She's gotta bear 
                         the punishment.

               Sissy beams serenely like a Christ figure.

               INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY DAY

               Sissy looks up "thumb" in the dictionary. It says: the short, 
               thick first or most preaxial digit of the human hand, 
               differing from the other fingers by having two phalanges and 
               greater freedom of movement.

               Sissy mouthing the words: "Greater freedom of movement."

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               Sissy very timidly ventures a pass with her gigantic right 
               thumb in the direction she is walking.

               She is passed by...... BUT NO!

               BRAKE LIGHTS! A Pontiac skids ever so slightly on the 
               snowflakes. View of the Pontiac insignia on the hood of the 
               car.

               Sissy runs, actually sweating, to its side. She peers in.

               OUTSIDE a palmist's trailer is a sign with a red silhouette 
               of a hand.

               Directly under the wrist where the watch band would be is 
               written MADAME ZOE.

               Madam Zoe in kimono and wig lets Sissy and her mother in the 
               door.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         I am the enlightened Madame Zoe.

               Inside. Madame Zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one of 
               those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are shaped 
               like bedpans and inscribed BUTTS. The trailer is cluttered, 
               but not one knick-knack, chintz curtain or chenille-covered 
               armchair seems to have come from the Beyond.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         There is nothing about your past, 
                         present or future that your hands do 
                         not know, and there is nothing about 
                         your hands that Madame Zoe does not 
                         know. There is no hocus-pocus 
                         involved. I am a scientist, not a 
                         magician. I, Madame Zoe, chiromancer, 
                         lifelong student of the moldings and 
                         markings of the human hand. I, Madame 
                         Zoe, to whom no facet of your 
                         character or destiny is not readily 
                         revealed. I am prepared to...

               Then she notices the thumbs.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Jesus fucking Christ!

               Mrs. Hankshaw and the fortune-teller turn pale and uncertain, 
               while Sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is in 
               command.

               Sissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might extend 
               his swollen parts to a medical missionary. Sissy's mama draws 
               a neatly folded five-dollar bill from her change purse and 
               extends it alongside her smiling daughter's extremities.

               Madame Zoe returns to her senses, and takes Sissy by the 
               elbow to sit at a For mica-topped table of undistinguished 
               design.

               Madam Zoe holds Sissy's hands while she appears to go into a 
               trance.

               She opens her eyes momentarily.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         You have a strong will. Will power 
                         and determination are indicated by 
                         the first phalanx. The second phalanx 
                         indicates reason and logic. You 
                         obviously have both in large supply. 
                         What's your name, dearie?

                                     SISSY
                         Sissy.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Hmmm. I'd say that you have an 
                         intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic 
                         nature. However, Sissy, however, 
                         there is a heavy quality to the second 
                         phalanx- the phalanx of logic -- 
                         that indicates a capacity for foolish 
                         or clownish behavior, a refusal to 
                         accept responsibility or to take 
                         things seriously and bent to be 
                         disrespectful of those who do. Your 
                         mama tells me that you're pretty 
                         well behaved and shy, but I'd watch 
                         out for signs of irrationality. All 
                         right?

               She pulls her thumb to her breast.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         I guess the most important aspect of 
                         your thumbs is the, ahem, over all 
                         size. Uh, what was it, do you know, 
                         that caused...?

               Mom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on

                                     MRS HANKSHAW
                         Don't know; the doctors don't know...

                                     SISSY
                         Just lucky I guess.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Do you study history in school? 
                         Galileo, Descartes, Newton? Lebinitz 
                         had very large thumbs; Voltaire's 
                         were enormous, but, heh heh, just 
                         pickles compared with yours.

                                     SISSY
                         What about Crazy Horse?

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Crazy Horse? You mean the Indian? 
                         Nobody that I've ever heard of ever 
                         troubled to study the paws of savages. 
                         Well, I guess that about covers the 
                         three-fifty charge...

               Madame Zoe lets go of Sissy's thumbs and wipes her hands on 
               her kimono.

                                     MRS. HANKSHAW
                         Husband.

               Mrs. Hankshaw withdraws a bill from her rat-skin bag.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Beg your pardon?

                                     MRS. HANKSHAW
                         Husband. Will she find a husband?

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         Oh, I see.

               Madame Zoe takes Sissy's hand and gives it the old tall-dark-
               stranger squint.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         I see men in your life, honey. I 
                         also see women, lots of women.

               She raises her eyes to meet Sissy's looking for an admission 
               of the "tendency", but there is no signal.

               Mrs. Hankshaw does not approve.

                                     MADAME ZOE
                         A husband, no doubt about it, though 
                         he is years away. There are children, 
                         too. Five, maybe six, but the husband 
                         is not the father. They will inherit 
                         your characteristics.

               Mrs. Hankshaw, aghast, has heard plenty, and she ushers her 
               daughter out of the trailer as if she were leading her from

                                    COWGIRL INTERLUDE

                                    (Delores del Ruby)

               EXT. BADLANDS DAY

               Views of vast vistas of arid grasslands, open and unmodulated, 
               thirsty and exposed.

               At the western edge of the DAKOTAS, the monotony of the 
               landscape, now gradually tilting toward the Rockies, is 
               interrupted by the Badlands -- sculptured canyons so deep 
               and chaotic they can break a devil's heart.

               Between the grasslands and the eerie badlands ruins, there 
               lies a narrow band of humpy hills, green and pastoral. The 
               hills are carpeted with midlength prairie grass.

               The Rubber Rose buildings are clustered at the badlands end 
               at the base of a butte, higher, broader and longer than any 
               in its vicinity, known as Siwash Ridge. a sign over the entry 
               of the ranch reads:

                             Welcome to the Rubber Rose Ranch

                         (the largest all-girl ranch in the west)

               Delores del Ruby arrives at the Rubber Rose Ranch, carrying 
               a whip at her side and batting an educated lash at the 
               surrounding sights.

                                     DELORES
                         I've traveled through the Yucatan 
                         with a circus, popping false eyelashes 
                         off a trained monkey with a bullwhip. 
                         When I ate peyote one night and had 
                         a vision. Niwetükame, the Mother 
                         Goddess, came to me on the back of a 
                         doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears 
                         she was shedding, crying 'Delores, 
                         you must lead my daughters against 
                         their natural enemy. You must come 
                         to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare 
                         for your mission, the details of 
                         which will be revealed to you in a 
                         third vision....' That night I whipped 
                         the shit out of my black lover and 
                         ran away. For a while I drove around, 
                         making a living selling peyote buttons 
                         to hippies, until I made my way 
                         here...

               A snake crosses the road in front of her, and she takes her 
               whip and whirls it around her head. The snake that is crawling 
               across the dusty road that leads to the ranch is carrying a 
               card under its forked tongue.

               Delores snaps her whip at the snake and picks the card out 
               of his mouth and lets it fly in the air.

               Delores catches it..... The card is the Queen of Spades.

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               Sissy is thirty years old now wearing a trademark colored 
               jumpsuit. She is saying these words still: "Greater freedom 
               of movement."

               Sissy sticks out her thumb, even though there is no traffic.

               A plane is flying overhead. Sissy hitches it; and the plane's 
               flight path curves with in response to her gesture. A squirrel 
               running by stops to look. The bus on the other side of the 
               road skids to a stop and two cars coming her way stop as 
               well.

               INT. CAR DAY

               The man driving looks over the back seat to the hitchiker 
               behind him.

               INT. BUS DAY

               The bus driver does the same.

               EXT. ROAD

               From the look of her Sissy is a very seasoned hitchhiker, 
               and she turns around relatively unimpressed with the fact 
               that a car has stopped for her.

               SISSY'S VIEW. The man driving is black-skinned, beret-topped 
               and he has four smiling gold teeth and six shiny brass 
               saxaphones in the back seat. He wears a gardenia in his lapel 
               and tokes on a short joint.

                                     SISSY
                         Going north?

                                     MAN
                         You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

               Sissy gets in.

               He turns up the volume of his radio and rockets north.

               INT. LINCOLN CONTINENTAL DAY

               Sissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of cheese 
               and offers it to him. He now gets a better look at her unusual 
               thumbs. They are elegant, but large boned, and 
               disproportionate. They are banana shaped boats that makes it 
               a little awkward to hold onto the cheese.

                                     MAN
                              (taking an alarming 
                              interest in her thumbs)
                         Thanks.

                                     SISSY
                         American Cheese. The king of road 
                         food.

               He eats the cheese, and worries about the thumbs. He tokes 
               on the joint between his fingers.

                                     MAN
                         Are you in show business?

                         I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene 
                         Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got 
                         laid off.

                                     MAN
                         So now you're bummin' around?

                                     SISSY
                         Yep.

                                     MAN
                         Hitchhiking?

                                     SISSY
                         I'm the best.

                                     MAN
                         You're the best?

                                     SISSY
                         When I was younger, I hitchhiked one 
                         hundred and twenty-seven hours without 
                         stopping, without food or sleep, 
                         crossed the continent twice in six 
                         days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans 
                         and caught rides after midnight on 
                         unlighted highways.

                                     MAN
                         Whooee!

                                     SISSY
                         As I developed, however, I grew more 
                         concerned with subtleties and nuances 
                         of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no 
                         longer interested me. I began to 
                         hitchhike in something akin to 
                         geological time: slow, ancient, vast. 
                         When I am really moving, stopping 
                         car after car after car, moving so 
                         freely, so clearly, so delicately 
                         that even the sex maniacs and the 
                         cops can only blink and let me pass, 
                         then I embody the rhythms of the 
                         universe. I am in a state of grace.

               The man listening to her takes another toke on his joint.

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               A view down the road of the Lincoln Continental going swiftly 
               in its direction.

               CREDIT INTERLUDE featuring the song "Even Cowgirls Get the 
               Blues" as sung by (an undetermined country or pop star like 
               k.d. lang or Bob Dylan) in an old television Kine-scope piece 
               of film like you might see on early 1950's television sets.

               Between Sissy watching this image on old motel televisions, 
               there are also IMAGES of roads, cars, trucks, highways, 
               thumbs, gas stations and deserts gliding by in a flow of 
               natural hitchhiking beauty.

               EXT. POST OFFICE DAY

               Sissy gets out of a large eighteen wheel truck and walks 
               into a United States Post Office.

               INT. POST OFFICE DAY

               Sissy at the window picking up some mail, and opening a 
               lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume, she is 
               surprised to read this:

               Sissy, Precious Being, How are you, my extraordinary one? I 
               worry so. Next time you are near Manhattan, do ring me up. 
               There is a man to whom I simply must introduce you. Thrill!! 
               -The Countess

               Sissy looks at the envelope and return address. Elaborately 
               embossed is the Countess' logo...

               INT. COUNTESS'S OFFICE DAY

               The elaborately embossed envelope is now being sealed.. The 
               Countess gives it a licking... Beside him is a young 
               watercolorist named Julian.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         I will send this out to Sissy, she 
                         should get it in a week, and you 
                         will be able to meet her. When I 
                         send a letter to Sissy, duplicates 
                         must be sent to U.S. Post Office 
                         Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge, 
                         Cherokee and that other place, for 
                         her to pick up... Why she's probably 
                         out there right now in Hibbing, 
                         Minnesota, or Deluth, Montana... 
                         hitching her way across the country.

               INT. TRUCKERS CAB NIGHT

               Sissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the road.

                                     SISSY
                         Right off, I don't remember how old 
                         I was when I found out I was part 
                         Indian. My mamma's family, a lot of 
                         them, had lived out West, in the 
                         Dakotas, and one of them had married 
                         a squaw. Siwash tribe. My pleasure 
                         in Indianhood and my passion for car 
                         travel might be incongruous if not 
                         mutually exclusive........ After 
                         all, the first car that ever stopped 
                         for me had been named in honor of 
                         the great chief of the Ottawa: 
                         Pontiac......

               In the distance, Sissy spies her destination. NEW YORK CITY.

                                     SISSY
                         NEW YORK CITY. It's still a helluva 
                         town....

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING DAY

               Sissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large building.

               INT. COUNTESS'S OFFICE DAY

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Sit down dear, do sit down.

               Sissy Hankshaw takes a seat. The Countess lifts a dusty 
               decanter.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Take a load off those lovely tootsies. 
                         Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy 
                         some sherry?

               The decanter is empty, a stiff fly lies feet up on it's lip.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Shit O goodness, I'm all out of 
                         sherry; how about some Red Ripple?

               He reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and 
               pulls out some pop wine.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         You know what Red Ripple is don't 
                         you? It's Kool-Aid with a hard on. 
                         Tee Hee.

               Sissy manages a polite smile. She looks at a heavily finger 
               printed glass.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                              (he toasts)
                         To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And 
                         welcome. So my letter brought ya 
                         flying, eh? Where were you? Salt 
                         Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may 
                         have a little surprise for you. But 
                         first, tell me about yourself. It's 
                         been six months, hasn't it? In some 
                         circles that's half a year. How are 
                         you?

                                     SISSY
                         Tired...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         That's the very first time in the 
                         eons that I've known you that I've 
                         ever heard you complain. And now 
                         you're tired, poor darling.

                         A born freak can only go uphill.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks 
                         in one way or another. Try being 
                         born a male Russian countess into a 
                         white middle class Baptist family in 
                         Mississippi and you'll see what I 
                         mean.

                         I've always been proud of the way 
                         nature singled me out. It's the people 
                         who have been deformed by society I 
                         feel sorry for. I've been steady 
                         moving for eleven years and some 
                         months. Maybe I should rest up for a 
                         spell, I'm not as young as I used to 
                         be.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty 
                         for another year, and you're more 
                         beautiful than ever.

                                     SISSY
                         Does that mean you might have an 
                         assignment for me?

               The Countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder. He 
               looks on his wall, and on a poster advertising a feminine 
               hygene product, Yoni Yum Dew Spray, stands Sissy Hankshaw, 
               her thumbs neatly hidden, chopped off by the borders of the 
               photograph.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         You were the Yoni Yum girl from, 
                         let's see,
                              (peruses the ad layouts 
                              on the wall)
                         from nineteen sixty-eight through 
                         nineteen seventy. You've always 
                         smelled so nice. Like a little sister. 
                         The irony has just killed me. You, 
                         the Dew Girl, one of the few girls 
                         who doesn't need Dew. I loath the 
                         stink of females! They are so sweet 
                         the way God made them, then they 
                         start fooling around with men and 
                         soon they're stinking. Like rotten 
                         mushrooms, like an excessively 
                         chlorinated swimming pool, like a 
                         tuna fish's retirement party. They 
                         all stink. From the Queen of England 
                         to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.

                                     SISSY
                         Bonanza Jellybean?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.

               The Countess's jaw muscles calm down, his dentures ease into 
               a samba...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         She's a young thing who works on my 
                         ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or 
                         something wooden like that. She's 
                         cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of 
                         course, it takes verve to change 
                         one's name so charmingly. But she 
                         stinks like a slut just the same.

                                     SISSY
                         Your ranch?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Oh my dear yes, I bought a little 
                         ranch out West, sort of a tribute to 
                         the women of America who have 
                         cooperated with me in eliminating 
                         their odor by using my vaginal 
                         products, Dew spray mist and Yoni 
                         Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, 
                         actually.

               He looks out his window as a squirrel crosses Park Avenue.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you 
                         can desist from wearing paths in 
                         those forgotten highways. The Countess 
                         has arranged a job for you. And what 
                         a job...

                                     SISSY
                         A job for me?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         I am once more about to make 
                         advertising history. And only you, 
                         the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could 
                         possibly assist me.

               The Countess hands Sissy an article that she reads clenched 
               in her fist.

                                     SISSY
                         The Food and Drug Administration 
                         said Wednesday female deodorant sprays 
                         may cause such harmful reactions as 
                         blisters, burns and rashes. Although 
                         the FDA judges that the reported 
                         reactions are not sufficient to 
                         justify removal of these products 
                         from the market, they are sufficient 
                         to warrant the proposed mandatory 
                         label warnings.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Shit O dear, that's enough to make 
                         me asthmatic. The nerve of those 
                         twits. What do they know about female 
                         odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my 
                         concept. My ranch out West? It's a 
                         beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few 
                         head of cattle for atmosphere and 
                         tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, 
                         a place where unhappy women -- 
                         divorcees and widows, mainly -- can 
                         go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, 
                         change their hair styles and pretty 
                         themselves up for the next 
                         disappointment. My ranch is named 
                         the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber 
                         Rose douche bag, my own invention, 
                         and bless its little red bladder, 
                         the most popular douche bag in the 
                         world. So get this. It's on the 
                         migratory flight path of the whooping 
                         cranes. The last flock of wild 
                         whooping cranes left in existence. 
                         Well, these cranes stop off at my 
                         little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's 
                         called -- twice a year, autumn and 
                         spring, and spend a few days each 
                         time, resting up, eating, doing 
                         whatever whooping cranes do. I've 
                         never seen them, understand, but I 
                         hear they're magnificent. Very big 
                         specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- 
                         and white as snow, to coin a phrase, 
                         except for black tips on their wings 
                         and tail feathers, and bright red 
                         heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case 
                         you didn't know it, are noted for 
                         their mating dance. It's just the 
                         wildest show in nature.
                         It's probably the reason why 
                         birdwatching used to be so popular 
                         with old maids and deacons. Picture 
                         these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds 
                         in full dance -- leaping six feet 
                         off the mud, arching their backs, 
                         flapping their wings, strutting low 
                         to the ground. Dears, it's 
                         overwhelming. And picture the birds 
                         doing their sex dance on TV. Right 
                         there on the home screen, creation's 
                         most elaborate sex ritual -- yet 
                         clean and pure enough to suit the 
                         Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in 
                         the foreground. In a white gown, red 
                         hood attached, and big feathery 
                         sleeves trimmed in black. In a very 
                         subdued imitation of the female 
                         whooping crane, she dance/walks over 
                         to a large nest in which there sits 
                         a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. 
                         Off-camera, a string quartet is 
                         playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is 
                         reading a few poetic lines about 
                         courtship and love. Are you starting 
                         to get it? Doesn't it make the hair 
                         on your neck stand up and applaud? 
                         My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, 
                         lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout-
                         oriented; you can't top it. I've 
                         hired a crew of experts from Walt 
                         Disney Studios, the best wildlife 
                         cinematographers around. You're my 
                         eternal favorite. Princess Grace 
                         herself couldn't be better, not even 
                         if she had your personality which 
                         she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out 
                         of photography now and into water 
                         colors. Ah how circuitous conversation 
                         is! We're back at the beginning. The 
                         exact man I've wanted you to meet is 
                         my artist the watercolorist.

               Sissy dares a sip of Red Ripple.

                                     SISSY
                         If you don't want me to pose for 
                         him, why do you want me to meet him?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Purely personal. I believe you might 
                         enjoy one another.

                                     SISSY
                         But Countess...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I 
                         realize that you've always avoided 
                         all but the most rudimentary 
                         involvements with men, and I might 
                         add, you've been wise. Heterosexual 
                         relationships seem to lead only to 
                         marriage. For men, marriage is a 
                         matter of efficient logistics: The 
                         male gets his food, bed, laundry, 
                         TV, pussy, offspring and creature 
                         comforts all under one roof, where 
                         he doesn't have to dissipate his 
                         psychic energy thinking about them 
                         too much, then he is free to go out 
                         and fight the battles of life, which 
                         is what existence is all about. But 
                         for a woman marriage is surrender.

               The Countess refills his glass. The squirrel starts across 
               Park Avenue again but doesn't make it. The uniformed chauffeur 
               gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where 
               it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         But here you are, still a virgin -- 
                         you are virginal yet, aren't you?

                                     SISSY
                         Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac 
                         and I came awfully close, but he was 
                         afraid of me, I think...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Yes, well, what I'm getting at is 
                         that there comes a time when it is 
                         psychologically impossible for a 
                         woman to lose her virginity. She 
                         can't wait too long, you know. Now, 
                         there's no reason why you must lose 
                         yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, 
                         that's all.

                                     SISSY
                              (her brow spaghettied)
                         What makes you think this 
                         watercolorist and I would develop a 
                         romantic relationship?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         I can't be certain that you would. 
                         But what have you got to lose?

                                     SISSY
                         Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see 
                         the point in it, but I'll try it. 
                         Just for you. It's kind of silly, 
                         actually, me going out with an artist 
                         in New York City. However...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, 
                         you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

               Suddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and leans 
               forward. Lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly, 
               intensely into Sissy's blue eyes. His smile widens.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         By the way, Sissy... he's a full 
                         blooded Indian.

                                    COWGIRL INTERLUDE

               INT. RUBBER ROSE OUTHOUSE DAY

               The Outhouse Radio is playing "The Starving Armenians Polka" 
               and Bonanza Jellybean and Delores del Ruby are in the privy, 
               caught in the rain.

                                     JELLY
                         Well, I'm not scared of a little 
                         rain.

                                     DELORES
                         Me neither.

                                     JELLY
                         Might as well brave it.

                                     DELORES
                         Right. I don't know about you but 
                         I'm sure not sweet enough to melt.

               Delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge 
               in the privy and hits the photograph of Dale Evans upon which 
               it has lit.

               Jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green 
               lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other 
               cowgirls.

               There is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip. Way off horse 
               lips flutter.

               Bonanza spies a picture of Sissy Hankshaw, an advertisement 
               for Yoni Yum Dew Spray mist, on the privy wall.

                                     JELLY
                              (musing)
                         Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw 
                         ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach 
                         her how to hypnotize a chicken. 
                         Chickens are the easiest critters on 
                         Earth to hypnotize. If you can look 
                         a chicken in the eyes for tens 
                         seconds, it's yours forever.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE DAY

               A meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning. 
               Mary is addressing the group.

                                     MARY
                         I want to complain that some of the 
                         cowgirls have been sleeping two to a 
                         bunk again, in violation of the 
                         agreement that "crimes against nature" 
                         are to be confined to the hayloft.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I don't care who lay with whom or 
                         where or how, but the moaners, 
                         groaners and screamers ought to turn 
                         down their volume when others are 
                         trying to sleep or meditate.

               Some of the younger cowgirls blush.

                                     BIG RED
                         I want to complain about the food 
                         around here! It's rotten to the core.

               A round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of 
               cattle calls.

               INT. OUTHOUSE DAY

               Jelly and Delores are getting ready to run through the rain, 
               when all of a sudden, Jelly spies a barefoot cowgirl -- it's 
               Debbie -- run across the yard in her karate robe, jump on 
               the Exercycle that is rusting in the weeds and begin pumping 
               the pedals furiously in the yammering rain.

                                     DELORES
                         My sacred crocodile! She's flipped.

               But in a minute, others follow Debbie, everyone of them, in 
               fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young 
               cowgirls, squealing, giggling, They slide and roll on the 
               wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by 
               the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick 
               folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles 
               and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough.

               The cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the 
               rain goes away. Play ceases. They are panting like puppies 
               as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from 
               one another's hair.

                                     ELAINE
                         I move that the meeting be adjourned.

                                     DEBBIE
                         At the end of the endless game, there 
                         is friendship.

                                     HEATHER
                         What the heck did she mean by that!

                                     JELLY
                         Just that in Heaven all business is 
                         conducted this way.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY NIGHT

               In the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing Sissy 
               inside wearing a buttoned up dress. Very formal looking for 
               her.

               There is Julian standing in the lobby. He turns and walks 
               toward Sissy. He is wearing a rather formal looking plaid 
               sport coat with blue cummerbund. He extends his hand to meet 
               her, and (perhaps at the sight of Sissy's thumbs) Julian has 
               an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her.

               Sissy doesn't know whether to assist Julian or flee.

               From the other side of the lobby, two WELL-GROOMED COUPLES, 
               white, mid-thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue. 
               The younger of the men, RUPERT, takes charge. He breaks an 
               inhaler of dinephrine under Julian's nose.

                                     RUPERT
                         We'd better take you home.

               In the red of embarrassment, Julian looks more Indian than 
               he had previously. Wheezing, he speaks:

                                     JULIAN
                         I beg your pardon. I've been 
                         enthralled with your photographs for 
                         years. When the Countess hinted that 
                         you might like to meet me -- he never 
                         explained why -- I was ready to paint 
                         for him free of charge. And now I 
                         had to go and spoil it.

               EXT. STREET NIGHT

               Rupert is helping Julian to the street. Rupert is a salesman 
               for a publishing house. His wife Carla, a homemaker, as they 
               say. The other couple breaks down into Howard and Marie Barth, 
               both copywriters for an ad agency.

               Howard hails a cab and Carla and Marie flutter around Sissy.

                                     MARIE
                         This is dreadful.
                              (lowering her voice 
                              confidentially)
                         You know, asthma attacks are brought 
                         on by emotional stress. Poor Julian 
                         is so high strung. The excitement of 
                         meeting you -- my dear, you look so 
                         stunning! -- must have upset his 
                         chemical balance.

               Carla nods. Everyone is piling into the taxi.

                                     RUPERT
                         Come on, Sissy, don't be afraid of 
                         us.

                                     SISSY
                         I've never ridden in a cab. The whole 
                         idea of paying for a ride makes my 
                         thumbs hurt.

               Sissy is forced to suffer the indignity of riding in a vehicle 
               she wasn't responsible for flagging with her own thumbs.

                                     CARLA
                         It'll be all right, dear. It isn't 
                         as serious as it sounds.

               INT. CAB NIGHT

               Carla starts to pat Sissy's hand, then decides to leave the 
               thumbs to themselves.

               The six of them are squeezed into the taxi. Sissy looks out 
               the window of the taxi:

               SISSY'S VIEW as the taxi stops at a light, she can see a 
               newsstand headline on the front page of the New York Daily 
               News:

               THE CHINK SUMS IT UP, SAYS LIFE IS HARD IF YOU THINK IT'S 
               HARD.

               EXT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT

               THE TAXI stops in front of Julian's building. It discharges 
               its passengers.

               INT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT

               INSIDE Howard mixes Scotch and sodas, Rupert fills a syringe 
               from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place 
               behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator. He gives 
               Julian an injection.

                                     RUPERT
                         There, that ought to beat them 
                         bronchial buggers into submission.

               He turns to Sissy.

                                     RUPERT
                         I was a medic in the Army. I really 
                         should have become a doctor. 
                         Sometimes, though, I feel that pushing 
                         books is a whole lot like pushing 
                         medicine. Think of books as pills. I 
                         have pills that cure ignorance and 
                         pills that cure boredom. I have pills 
                         to elevate moods and pills to open 
                         people's eyes to the awful truth...

                                     CARLA
                         Too bad you don't have a pill for 
                         bullshit.

               Carla smiles as if she were joking, but she'd said it tartly. 
               Rupert glares and takes a big bite of Scotch.

                                     HOWARD
                              (changing the subject)
                         Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?

                                     SISSY
                         I'm staying with the Countess.

                                     HOWARD
                         I know, but where do you reside when 
                         you aren't visiting New York?

                                     SISSY
                         I don't.

                                     HOWARD
                         You don't?

                                     SISSY
                         Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in 
                         particular. I just keep moving.

               Everyone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent 
               Julian.

                                     HOWARD
                         A traveler, eh?

                                     SISSY
                         You might say that, although I don't 
                         think of it as traveling.

                                     CARLA
                         How do you think of it?

                                     SISSY
                         As moving.

                                     CARLA
                         Oh.

                                     MARIE
                         How... unusual...

                                     HOWARD
                         Mmmmm...

               Rupert bites into his Scotch again. Julian issues a watery 
               wheeze. Then, silence.

                                     CARLA
                         Rupert, before you get too engrossed 
                         in your research on Scotch as a cure 
                         for aging, don't you think you'd 
                         better phone Elaine's and cancel our 
                         dinner reservations?

               Sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment. Which 
               is full of books and shelves.

                                     RUPERT (O.S.)
                         What would we do without you, Carla? 
                         Without our little efficiency expert, 
                         Carla, everything would just go to 
                         hell. Carla is thinking about running 
                         for mayor next year, aren't you, 
                         Carla?

                                     CARLA (O.S.)
                         Up yours, Herr Doktor Book Salesman. 
                         Will the demands of your medical 
                         practice allow you to call Elaine's 
                         or shall I?

                                     MARIE (O.S.)
                         Oh let me do it.

               Sissy is intrigued by an antique here and an object d'art 
               there, but she knows she is in an alien environment.

               INT. JULIAN'S BEDROOM NIGHT

               Sissy enters a bedroom There is a covered birdcage. She sits 
               upon the bed listening for a 'cheep' from the birds.

               And gradually she reclines. Then turning her head to the 
               side against the bedspread:

                                     SISSY
                         No Indian blankets... no Indian 
                         blankets...

               And she blacks out. And the sound drifts away in waves, so 
               there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar 
               of the apartment building...

               ...Until one by one, we see button necks freed. Soon Sissy 
               can feel it.

               Someone is undressing her. In a voice webby with sleep she 
               lifts her head up, and sees Howard and Marie.

                                     SISSY
                         Where are the others?

                                     HOWARD
                         Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little 
                         hassle and went home.

                                     MARIE
                         Julian fell asleep on the couch; we 
                         covered him up.

                                     HOWARD
                         We thought that we should make you 
                         comfortable too.

               Sissy thinks this is nice, but wonders, however, why they 
               are both in their underwear.

                                     SISSY
                         Yes, thanks...

               Between the two of them, they have gotten Sissy out of her 
               dress in no time. Sissy feels she should apologize for not 
               having on a brassiere.

               Marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom 
               close to Sissy's.

                                     MARIE
                         Mine are fuller but yours are more 
                         perfectly shaped.

                                     HOWARD
                         Highly debatable. I'll wager they're 
                         the exact same size.

               Howard cups his left hand about a Marie breast and his right 
               about one of Sissy's. He weighs them in his palms, squeezes 
               them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a 
               lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their 
               circumference.

                                     HOWARD
                         Hmm. Yours are larger, Marie, but 
                         Miss Hankshaw's -- Sissy's -- are 
                         more firm. You'd think they would 
                         have started to droop; I mean, from 
                         not wearing a bra.

                                     MARIE
                         Howard! Watch your manners. You've 
                         made her blush. Here, Sissy, let me 
                         compare.

               Marie seizes Sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey 
               picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger, 
               rubbing it against her chin and cheeks...

               ...and...

               ...it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker.... 
               nostalgic..... tropical plums.

                                     SISSY
                              (in ecstasy)
                         This place is finer than the place I 
                         live!

               Like a disc jockey from Paradise, Howard flips Marie over 
               and plays her B side. Every now and then she reaches for 
               Sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being 
               obeyed.

               Over and over Marie calls Sissy's name with half-closed eyes.

               The Barths are really going at it, Marie yowling like a cat.

               The POODLE in the kitchen begins to growl.

                                     SISSY
                         So this is what it's like... so this 
                         is what it's really like.

               INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT

               Sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living 
               room and crawls under the cover with Julian. Julian stirs 
               awake.

                                     JULIAN
                         Oh, Sissy. I am sorry about all the 
                         fuss.

               Julian and Sissy embrace and go at it under the covers But 
               suddenly: Julian stops after a brief climax.

                                     JULIAN
                              (with downcast eyes)
                         I apologize.

               Sissy cradles Julian and comforts him.

                                     JULIAN
                         It is the measure of Western 
                         Civilization that it can encompass 
                         in harmony, balance off, as it were, 
                         such divergent masterworks as A 
                         MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and THE 
                         AMERICAN DREAM, as the dome of the 
                         Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of 
                         the Paris opera.

               Sissy sits up, her eyes moping about the apartment, looking 
               but not seeing the macrame wallhangings, the volumes of Robert 
               Frost.

                                     JULIAN
                         What's the matter?

               After a while Sissy answers.

                                     SISSY
                         I'm cold.

                                     JULIAN
                         Here. I'll turn down the air 
                         conditioner.

                                     SISSY
                         It's not the air conditioner that's 
                         making me cold. Nothing moves in 
                         here. Not even your birds.

               Sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress.

                                     JULIAN
                         What are you doing?

                                     SISSY
                         Getting dressed. I've got to go.

                                     JULIAN
                         But I don't want you to leave. Please 
                         stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you 
                         a dinner. And tonight... we can... 
                         really make love.

                                     SISSY
                         I have to go, Julian.

                                     JULIAN
                         Why? Why do you have to go?

                                     SISSY
                              (somewhat frantic)
                         My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. 
                         I've been negligent. I haven't 
                         exercised. I have to hitchhike a 
                         little bit every day, no matter what. 
                         It's like a musician practicing his 
                         scales. When I don't practice, my 
                         timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff 
                         and sore.

               EXT. CITY DAWN

               Sissy trembles while she kisses her thumbs.

                                     SISSY
                         I will hitch with you, out where 
                         tall birds wade in a lake named for 
                         my Siwash kin. Out where Smokey the 
                         Bear lay down his shovel to romp 
                         with more playful beasts. Out where 
                         starlight has no enemies and the 
                         badland wind no friends. Out where 
                         the boogie stops and the woogie 
                         begins.

               INT. TRUCK DAY

               And Sissy is now traveling in a truck passing Fourteenth 
               Street on her way to the Geo. Washington Bridge.

               View of that Bridge as the truck crosses it to New Jersy.

               View of the wilds of New Jersey as Sissy travels to the West.

               INT. COUNTESS' OFFICE

               The Countess is on the phone.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         So she left town. Well, that shouldn't 
                         surprise you. Leaving town is what 
                         Sissy is all about. But tell me, how 
                         did she strike you?

               Julian is on the other end of the phone.

                                     JULIAN
                         Extraordinary!

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         She's obviously that. Jesus! Which 
                         would you rather have, a million 
                         dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs 
                         full of pennies?

                                     JULIAN
                         Oh, you! I'm not talking about her 
                         hands. They're difficult to ignore, 
                         I confess, but I'm speaking of her 
                         whole being. Her whole being is 
                         extraordinary. The way she talks, 
                         for example. She's so articulate.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         It's high time you realized, honey 
                         babe, that a woman doesn't have to 
                         give the best years of her life to 
                         Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak 
                         the English language.

                                     JULIAN
                         Countess. I'm really in a dither. 
                         She's turned my head.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. 
                         How does she feel about you?

                                     JULIAN
                         I think she's disappointed that I'm 
                         not more, ah, sort of atavistic. 
                         She's got some naive, sentimental 
                         notions about Indians. I'm sure she 
                         liked me, though; but.... then she 
                         left town.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         She always leaves town, you dummy. 
                         That doesn't mean anything. What 
                         about in bed? How does she like it 
                         in bed?

               Julian pauses for a very long moment.

                                     JULIAN
                         How does she like what in bed?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Like what?

               The Countess' teeth chatter in his mouth.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         What do you think?

                                     JULIAN
                         Well.... er...

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to 
                         tell me you didn't get it on?

                                     JULIAN
                         Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Whose fault was that?

                                     JULIAN
                         I suppose it was mine. Yes, it 
                         definitely was my fault.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         What do they do to you boys in those 
                         Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap 
                         you down and pump the Nature out of 
                         you? They can even press the last 
                         drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. 
                         Why, send a shaman or cannibal to 
                         Yale for four years and all he'd be 
                         fit for would be a desk in the 
                         military-industrial complex and a 
                         seat in the third row at a Neil Simon 
                         comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If 
                         Harvard or Princeton could get hold 
                         of the Chink for a couple of semesters 
                         they'd turn him into a candidate for 
                         the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. 
                         Oogie boogie.

                                     JULIAN
                         If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy 
                         enough to suit you hillbillies, at 
                         least we don't go around indulging 
                         in racist terms such as 'Chink.' 
                         Next thing I know, you'll be calling 
                         me 'chief.'

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's 
                         sake.

                                     JULIAN
                         What guy?

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Aw, he's some old fart holyman who 
                         lives in the hills out West. Gives 
                         my ranch the creeps and the willies, 
                         too. But though he be old and dirty, 
                         he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to 
                         his toes. They don't have his juice 
                         in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose 
                         that I'll have to write Sissy out on 
                         the road.

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               Sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks.

               From the direction of the ranch a VW Microbus is approaching. 
               It is painted with mandalas, lamaistic dorjes and symbols 
               representing "the clear light of the void."

               When the Microbus draws alongside Sissy it stops. Inside are 
               two men and a woman. They are approximately twenty-four years 
               old.

                                     WOMAN
                         Are you a pilgrim?

                                     SISSY
                         No, I'm more of an Indian The trio 
                         doesn't smile.

                                     DRIVER
                         She means are you going to see the 
                         Chink?

                                     SISSY
                         Oh, I may and I may not. But seeing 
                         him is not my main objective out 
                         here.

                                     DRIVER
                         That's good. Because he won't see 
                         you. We came all the way from 
                         Minneapolis to see him and the crazy 
                         bastard tried to stone us to death

                                     OTHER MAN
                         Yeah, but I no longer believe that 
                         guy's a master. He's just a dirty, 
                         uptight old mountain man. Why, he 
                         pulled out his pecker and shook it 
                         at Barbara. I'd stay away from there 
                         if I were you, lady.

               Sissy walks on leaving the people in the bus arguing about 
               whether the Chink's rock-shower and pecker-wag actually had 
               been intended as spiritual messages.

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               WALKING down the long dirt road, Sissy stops to take a 
               breather and sits down on a log.

               Sissy thinking and looking into the clouds.

               Waves of grasses whisper her name: Ssssssssss, Sssssssssssss 
               Sisssy.

               Meadowlarks squander their songs on her as she begins to 
               squirm on the log.

               A Lincoln Continental drives up suddenly. Sissy barely has 
               time to zip up.

               The Cadillac stops in front of Sissy. A teenaged girl in a 
               Stetson is at the wheel. The rear door of the limousine opens 
               and a refined matronly voice calls from the void.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         By any chance are you Sissy Hankshaw?

                                     SISSY
                         Yes I am.

               A chic middle-aged woman leans out of the car.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         My goodness. Why didn't you telephone? 
                         Someone would have driven into 
                         Mottburg to pick you up. I'm Miss 
                         Adrian. From the ranch. The Countess 
                         wrote that I should expect you. Get 
                         in, won't you? You must be exhausted. 
                         Gloria, assist Miss Hankshaw with 
                         her luggage.

               Gloria nods at Sissy amicably but doesn't make a move to 
               help her.

               Sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle. Before she 
               gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride.

               The instant that Sissy shuts the door the cowgirl chauffeur 
               floors the Cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of dust.

               INT. CADDY DAY

               Sitting up after the bothersome lurch of the car.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         Little twit.
                              (turns to Sissy)
                         You really ought to have phoned. We 
                         were just in Mottburg escorting some 
                         guests to the afternoon train.
                              (sighs)
                         More guests leaving ahead of schedule. 
                         Three checked out today. They decided 
                         to transfer to Elizabeth Arden's 
                         Maine Chance spa in Phoenix, Arizona. 
                         It costs two hundred and fifty dollars 
                         a week less at the Rubber Rose, so 
                         why are our guests leaving and going 
                         to Elizabeth Arden's?

               Miss Adrian pushes a button that sends a partition glass 
               between her and the cowgirl driver. Gloria starts laughing 
               silently on the other side of the glass.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         I'll tell you why, it's that plague 
                         of cowgirls. They've gradually 
                         infiltrated every sector of our 
                         program. The one named Debbie 
                         considers herself an expert on 
                         exercising and diet. With Bonanza 
                         Jellybean's permission and against 
                         my explicit orders, she's been 
                         coercing the guests into trying 
                         something called kundalini yoga. Do 
                         you know what that is? It's trying 
                         to mentally force a serpent of fire 
                         to crawl up your spinal column. Miss 
                         Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend 
                         kundalini yoga, let alone do it. 
                         Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook 
                         by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third 
                         Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul 
                         Food. God knows what that will be 
                         like. The little barbarians are 
                         destroying everything that I've built, 
                         mocking all that the company stands 
                         for. And there's a new one, one they 
                         call del Ruby. She has the good will 
                         of a scorpion. I've considered it 
                         prudent to avoid a confrontation 
                         that might further upset the guests. 
                         But now that the season is practically 
                         over -- we operate April through 
                         September -- and the Countess is 
                         finally coming...

               EXT. RUBBER ROSE DAY

               The limousine pulls up in the drive.

                                     MISS ADRIAN'S VOICE
                         Our Ranch has all the latest in modern 
                         facilities...

               INT. BEAUTY RANCH DAY

               We see women having facials.

                                     MISS ADRIAN'S VOICE
                         We have a facial wing, and next to 
                         that is the Hair Barn...

               INT. HAIR BARN DAY

               Sissy is being given a tour by Miss Adrian. A variety of 
               hairdos are witnessed.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         We have a team of fifteen hair experts 
                         from all over the world.

               INT. EXERCISE ROOM DAY

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         And fanny flab flies off in this 
                         room at the rate of six hundred and 
                         seventy-five pounds a day... that's 
                         a lot of salted ham, Sissy....

               INT. MAIN LODGE DAY

               Sissy and Miss Adrian walk through the lodge lobby, guests 
               and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities:

               A BIRD EXPERT projects slides of whooping cranes on the wall 
               and is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds.

               In the center of the room COWGIRL DEBBIE is leading a mixture 
               of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they reach 
               high above their heads in a yoga exercise.

               Miss Adrian stops in front of the registration desk and Sissy 
               catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw 
                         is with us.

               The receptionist hands Miss Adrian a key to Sissy's room.

               A COWGIRL makes a face at Sissy as she walks by carrying a 
               tray of herbal teas.

               A representative of the film crew is being intimidated by a 
               Cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and shaking 
               them and listening to them like you would put a shell up to 
               your ear to hear the ocean.

                                     COWGIRL
                         Cool! We're going to make a movie!...

               Another cowgirl, BIG RED, is lifting a piece of furniture 
               and passes it to her accomplice.

                                     BIG RED
                         Get rid of the furniture.... it's 
                         too masculine... Get rid of all the 
                         furniture and use it for kindling!!! 
                         Break away from these pig-like 
                         chauvinist masculine influences....

               Miss Adrian looks on helplessly.... she grabs Sissy and leads 
               her out of the lobby.

               EXT. CORRAL DAY

               Miss Adrian and Sissy walk out the back door of the Ranch 
               and out near a corral, to the sound of gunfire.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         O merciful Jesus! They're murdering 
                         the guests!

               One of the FILM CREW MEMBERS is hanging out in the corral 
               wearing a shiny jacket with DISNEY printed on the back.

               Miss Adrian grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         Where are the guests?

                                     MAN
                         Take it easy, lady. They went on a 
                         short ride with the cowgirls. Rode 
                         over the hill yonder. You're Miss 
                         Adrian, aren't you? We need to talk 
                         to you about the filming.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         Not now, you fool, not now. Those 
                         crazed bitches have led innocent 
                         women out and are slaughtering them 
                         at this moment. We'll all be killed. 
                         Oh! Ohhh!

               Another CAMERAMAN spits out a wad of chewing gum.

                                     CAMERAMAN
                         There's a slaughter going on all 
                         right, but it's not the fat ladies 
                         that are getting it. Your hired hands 
                         are killing the cattle.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         The cattle? They're killing the cows? 
                         All of them?

                                     CAMERAMAN
                              (interrupted while 
                              putting a zoom lens 
                              on his camera)
                         That's what they said, Miss Adrian.

               A devilish young cowgirl is sitting on a fence nearby. Miss 
               Adrian addresses her.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         How dare you slaughter the Countess's 
                         cattle! What is a ranch without cows?

                                     COWGIRL
                         We're going to replace them with 
                         goats. Most of the cattle are diseased 
                         and in pain. We're just putting them 
                         out of their misery. According to 
                         Bon-an-za Jellybean, the Rubber Rose 
                         is in-di-cat-ive of the Countess's 
                         values. He has purchased a cheap 
                         weak strain of cow to begin with and 
                         with improper care....

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         Oh heavens! I don't want to hear 
                         what Bonanza Jellybean has been 
                         telling you girls.... Come on Sissy. 
                         I'll show you to your quarters.

               AND THE SUN SETS OVER THE CANYON, THE HILLS AND SIWASH RIDGE 
               NEARBY.

               THE CHINK, with his back to us looks down on the ranch from 
               the ridge and watches Miss Adrian lead Sissy into a small 
               guest cottage on the ranch.

               A DISTANT COYOTE HOWLS, AND A FEW SCATTERED GUNSHOTS ARE 
               HEARD.

               INT. RANCH COTTAGE MORNING

               Sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage. A maid knocks 
               on the door and serves Sissy breakfast in bed.

                                     MAID
                         Excuse me, Miss. Do you care for 
                         your breakfast now?

               Sissy sits up and rubs her eyes.

                                     SISSY
                         Yeah. I feel a bit hungry.

               The Maid puts the tray down, and the cloth that covers the 
               food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease 
               and calories.

               A vase of prairie asters stands over a double-meat 
               cheeseburger, a package of Hostess Twinkies, a cold can of 
               Dr. Pepper and a Three Musketeers bar.

               Sissy is delighted.

                                     SISSY
                         Road food. How did you know?

                                     MAID
                         Well it is a change of our usual 
                         grapefruit and melba toast, I'm sure.

               Sissy notices a card. It reads:

                             Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean

                                     SISSY
                         Bonanza Jellybean....

                                     MAID
                         She will be up to see you directly.

               Sissy devours her meal. Out her window she can see women on 
               exercycles, women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty 
               parlors.

               A FIST pounds on Sissy's door.

               IN SAILS Jelly, a cowgirl so cute she makes Sissy blush just 
               to look at her. She wears a tan Stetson with an aster pinned 
               to it, a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions 
               snorting orange fire from their nostrils.

               Her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded 
               on helium and, between red tinged cheeks, where more baby 
               fat is taking its time maturing, she has a little smile that 
               can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient 
               animate connections.

               Jelly grasps Sissy's elbow and sits on the side of the bed.

                                     JELLY
                         Welcome, podner. By God, it's great 
                         to have you here. It's an honor. 
                         Sorry I took so long getting to you, 
                         but we've had a mess of hard work 
                         these past few days -- and a heap of 
                         planning to do.

                                     SISSY
                         Er, you seem to know who I am, and 
                         maybe even what I am. Thanks for the 
                         breakfast.

                                     JELLY
                         Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all 
                         right. I've done a little hitchhiking 
                         myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling 
                         Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter 
                         because you once knocked a tomato 
                         can off a stump with a fieldstone. 
                         I'd heard tales about you from people 
                         I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. 
                         I heard about your, uh, your, ah, 
                         your wonderful thumbs, and I heard 
                         how you were Jack Kerouac's girl 
                         friend...

               Sissy sets her tray on the bedside table.

                                     SISSY
                         No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. 
                         Jack was in awe of me and tracked me 
                         down. We spent a night talking and 
                         hugging in a corn field, but he was 
                         hardly my lover. Besides, I always 
                         travel alone.

                                     JELLY
                         Well, that doesn't matter; that part 
                         never interested me anyway. The 
                         beatnicks were before my time, and I 
                         never got anything outta the hippies 
                         but bad dope, clichés and the clap. 
                         But the example of your life helped 
                         me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.

               The guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in 
               conversation, in the background through the window in Sissy's 
               room.

                                     SISSY
                         Tell me about it.

                                     JELLY
                         About...

                                     SISSY
                         About being a cowgirl. What's it all 
                         about? When you say the word you 
                         make it sound like it was painted in 
                         radium on the side of a pearl.

                                     JELLY
                         Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly 
                         common image. The idea of cowgirls 
                         especially for little girls prevails 
                         in our culture. Therefore, it seems 
                         to me, the existence of cowgirls 
                         should prevail. Otherwise, they're 
                         being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of 
                         Fame in Oklahoma City there are just 
                         two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em 
                         are trick-riders. Trick-riding is 
                         what cowgirls have almost always 
                         done in rodeos. Our society sure 
                         likes to see its unconventional women 
                         do tricks. That's what prostitutes 
                         call it, you know: 'tricking.'

               Jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound Sissy's thumb makes 
               under the covers.

                                     SISSY
                         You're political, then?

                                     JELLY
                         No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on 
                         the Rubber Rose who are political, 
                         but I don't share their views. I got 
                         no cowgirl ideology to expound. 
                         "Politics is for people who have a 
                         passion for changing life but lack a 
                         passion for living it."

               There is a moment when the two girls feel something between 
               each other.

                                     JELLY
                         Did that last comment sound too 
                         profound to be coming outta my mouth? 
                         It's not original. It's something I 
                         picked up from the Chink.

                                     SISSY
                         Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered 
                         that you sometimes speak with him. 
                         What else have you learned from the 
                         Chink?

                                     JELLY
                         Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha 
                         ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... 
                         Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

               Jelly pauses.

                                     JELLY
                         Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the 
                         Chink taught me something about 
                         cowgirls. Did you realize that 
                         cowgirls have been around for many 
                         centuries? Long before America. In 
                         ancient India the care of the cattle 
                         was always left up to young women 
                         they called gopis. Being alone with 
                         the cows all the time, the gopis got 
                         awfully horny, just like we do here. 
                         Every gopi was in love with Krishna, 
                         a good-looking young god who played 
                         the flute like it was going out of 
                         style When the moon was full, this 
                         Krishna would play his flute by a 
                         river and call the gopis to him. 
                         Then he would multiply himself sixteen 
                         thousand times -- one for each gopi -- 
                         and make love to each one the way 
                         she most desired. There they were, 
                         sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna 
                         on the river bank, and the energy of 
                         their merging was so great that it 
                         created a huge oneness, a total union 
                         of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite 
                         a picture, huh?

               Sissy's thumb twitches. Jelly swallows hard. They gaze into 
               each other's eyes.

               A WHISTLE pierces the sunlight outside the window.

                                     JELLY
                         That couldn't be Krishna, could it? 
                         A bit shrill for a flute. Just our 
                         rotten luck.

               Jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with 
               someone outside.

                                     JELLY
                         Gotta run now. Delores says I'm 
                         needed. Somebody's here. Maybe it's 
                         the Countess.

               Jelly spins her six-shooter in her kewpie fingers.

                                     JELLY
                         Sissy, cowgirl history is about to 
                         be made. I'm damn glad you're here 
                         to witness it.

               She holsters her gun and blows Sissy a kiss, then is gone 
               out the door.

               Sissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls 
               gathering in a circle. Someone or something is in the center 
               of the circle.

               Sissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside.

               EXT. CORRAL DAY

               What was in the center of the circle was a goat. Debbie was 
               scratching the animal's ears. She was hugging it.

                                     KYM
                         It's cute. Way cuter than a cow.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Goats are always testing you. They're 
                         like Zen masters. They can tell 
                         instantly if you're faking your 
                         feelings. So they play games with 
                         you to keep you true. People should 
                         go to goats instead of psychiatrists.

                                     GLORIA
                         It's so loving.

               Gloria cuts in on Debbie and gives the beast a hug.

                                     HEATHER
                         Look at those playfully wise eyes.

                                     GLORIA
                         Ooo! It licked me!

                                     JELLY
                         More and more people are discovering 
                         that cow's milk isn't fit for human 
                         consumption. Billy West says if we 
                         can produce enough goat's milk on 
                         the ranch to make it worth his while, 
                         he'll run it into Fargo regularly.

               She pauses and looks around the group in the circle.

                                     DELORES
                         I'm aware that Tad Lucas rode broncs 
                         until her ninth month, but I don't 
                         think pregnant cowgirls are going to 
                         be any asset on this ranch. I hope 
                         you itchy clits who are sneaking 
                         down to the lake every night are 
                         taking precautions. It's bad enough 
                         we've got cranes coming; we don't 
                         need storks. I feel that those film 
                         makers should be removed from the 
                         Rubber Rose as soon as possible. Men 
                         can cause nothing but trouble here. 
                         I also feel that our guest
                              (she nods at Sissy)
                         should be excused while we discuss 
                         this matter further.

               Hurt, Sissy leaves the group.

               EXT. RANCH DAY

               Views of Sissy in her Whooping crane outfit dancing to Debussy 
               in front of the Disney film crew. The documentary being 
               directed by an effusive Frenchman.

               View of the camera crew training their long telephoto lenses 
               on Siwash Lake. They all seem to be wearing the same trademark 
               satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on their 
               backs.

               Another view of the lake, from above, from the Chink's point 
               of view and our first view of THE CHINK. The Chink spies 
               Sissy and Jelly coming over a ridge.

               We cannot hear them at first, but Sissy and Jelly are talking.

                                     JELLY
                         ......Delores zonks out on peyote at 
                         least once a week, but so far her 
                         Third Vision hasn't happened. 
                         Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has 
                         not gotten back in touch with her. 
                         Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling 
                         each other like a couple of crosstown 
                         high schools. Tension. Cowgirl 
                         tension! What a drag.

                                     SISSY
                         What is Debbie's position?

                                     JELLY
                         Debbie says that if women are to 
                         take charge again, they must do it 
                         in the feminine way; they mustn't 
                         resort to aggressive and violent 
                         masculine methods. She says it is up 
                         to women to show themselves better 
                         than men, to love men, set good 
                         examples for them and guide them 
                         tenderly toward the New Age. She's a 
                         real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

                                     SISSY
                         You don't agree with Debbie, then?

                                     JELLY
                         I wouldn't say that. I expect she's 
                         right, ultimately. But I'm with 
                         Delores when it comes to fighting 
                         for what's mine. I can't understand 
                         why Delores is so uptight about the 
                         Chink; he could probably teach her a 
                         thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, 
                         doesn't it? God knows I love women, 
                         but nothing can take the place of a 
                         man that fits. Still this is cowgirl 
                         territory and I'll stand with Delores 
                         and fight any bastards who might 
                         deny it. I guess I've always been a 
                         scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve 
                         years old and I was felled by a silver 
                         bullet.

               Jelly takes Sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and 
               helps her feel the depression in her belly. The depression 
               is a dimple, like another navel.

               AFTER A HUNGRY STILLNESS, like intermission at a wolf dance, 
               rhythms are established. Jelly and Sissy are socked into one 
               another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and 
               jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence.

               Everything becomes scrambled. They rock each other in cradles 
               of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing.

               Noisy breaths buck out of Sissy: "Jelly, Jelly" but she can't 
               hear Sissy because she is screaming. Hysterical from the 
               scalding hot softness of girl-love.

               EXT. HILLTOP DAY

               The Chink looks on from the hilltop above indifferently.

               EXT. FIELD DAY

               Sissy and Jelly are riding on the back of a horse.

               A WHOOPING CRANE is spied by Sissy as she rides on the back 
               of Jellybean's horse back to the ranch. Delores and Big Red 
               hurry to meet them.

                                     DELORES
                         He's here.

               Sure enough across the yard, in the midst of the low-cal 
               barbecue in progress, monocle reflecting sunlight, cigarette 
               holder stabbing the air, stands the Countess.

                                     DELORES
                         Look at him. Perverse as a pink 
                         pickle.

                                     BIG RED
                         Sick as a vice squad.

                                     DELORES
                         He's in a snit. He wants to see you 
                         right after the barbecue.

               Jellybean chuckles sardonically and dismounts.

                                     JELLY
                         Get the girls. He's gonna see me 
                         right now.

               Sissy, confused, and loyalties torn in the face of an 
               impending revolution, leaves the corral and

               SLIPS INSIDE THROUGH THE KITCHEN.

               DOWN THE HALL

               ENTERING HER ROOM, SHE LOCKS HERSELF IN. As she locks the 
               latch she hears Jelly's voice.

               INT RANCH OFFICE DAY

               Jelly has taken over the ranch loudspeaker system and is 
               giving an ultimatum.

                                     JELLY
                         Any of you ladies who would like to 
                         join us, you're welcome to stay on 
                         as a full working podner at the Rubber 
                         Rose. Rest of you get packed -- and 
                         I mean now. You've got fifteen minutes 
                         to move your lard asses off this 
                         ranch.

               INSIDE THE EXERCISE ROOM

               Women are reacting to the demands.

               INSIDE THE GREENHOUSE

               Some women are taking up trowels and brooms as weapons.

               INSIDE THE KITCHEN

               The help is joining the revolt.

               INSIDE THE HALLWAY

               Other women are running for their lives.

               INSIDE SISSY'S ROOM

               She hears the screen door screech open and a chaos of 
               footsteps in the hall. She goes to her window. And she can 
               see, partially cut off by the corner of the building, Miss 
               Adrian screaming.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                         You will all be rounded up and sent 
                         to prison if you take this any 
                         farther! This is not your ranch!!!!

               EXT. THE FRONT YARD OF THE RUBBER ROSE

               The Countess seems to be taking it slowly, and calmly smoking 
               a French cigarette. He observes the fighting among them with 
               amusement.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         You pathetic little cutesy-poos. Do 
                         you actually suppose this exhibition 
                         of childlike melodrama is advancing 
                         the cause of freedom?

                                     JELLY
                         You owe us this here ranch, as a 
                         token payment for your disgusting 
                         exploitations

                                     THE COUNTESS
                              (tranquilly)
                         Then take it.

                                     JELLY
                         Go for it, girls!

               The hands, who carry axes, picks, pitchforks and shovels, 
               retreat. The Countess, still grinning, reaches for an hors 
               d'oeuvre and subjects his cigarette to a measured, self-
               assured puff.

                                     MISS ADRIAN
                              (shaking her fist)
                         Go to your bunkhouse and remain there!

               INT. ROOMS

               The guests are hurriedly packing their things.

               INT. SISSY'S ROOM

               She looks on.

               EXT. FRONT YARD

               When the revolutionaries have retreated about thirty yards, 
               they stop. With astonishing rapidity, they unbuckle unbutton 
               and unzip and step out of their jeans and underpants. Then, 
               nude from the waist down, thatched pubises thrust forward, 
               up front and leading the way, they begin to advance.

               The Countess's grin goes down his throat like bathwater down 
               a drain.

                                     GLORIA
                         Better reach for your spray cans!

                                     JELLY
                         Not one of these pussies has been 
                         washed in a week!

               Rather pale, his nose twitching, the Countess drops the caviar 
               canapé he has been holding.

               ON COME THE COWGIRLS, pelvises pumping, laying down what the 
               trembling Countess believes to be a devastating barrage of 
               musk.

               Miss Adrian, lost in her own hysteria, charges. A barbeque 
               fork she hurls draws blood from Heather's eyebrow.

               Quick as a frog's tongue, Delores's whip cracks. It's lash 
               curls around the ranch manager's ankles, pulling her feet 
               from under her. She hits the sod in a jangle of jewelry and 
               expulsion of breath.

               A Molotov cocktail thrown by Big Red says hello to the sexual 
               reconditioning building. Within seconds, the structure is 
               blazing.

               INT. MAIN HOUSE

               THE BARE-ASSED COWGIRLS storm into the beauty parlor and 
               exercise rooms.

               SOUNDS OF breaking glass and wood splintering. The air is 
               singing with cries of "Wahoo," Yippee," "Let 'er buck" and 
               "The vagina is a self-cleaning organ."

               INT. KITCHEN

               SISSY flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door.

               EXT. CROQUET COURT

               Sissy running across it. She passes the pool, and falls in. 
               Climbing out, wet, scared, she runs to the base of Siwash 
               Ridge and southward along the mountain's foot.

               EVENTUALLY Sissy comes to a place where the juniper bushes 
               are broken to reveal a crude path beginning a steep ascent. 
               Sissy decides to climb up it.

               She shoulders her way through low, slivery boughs.

               Approximately halfway up the ridge she rests on a flat rock 
               from which she can look down on the...

               BURNING RUBBER ROSE smoking away, distant yahoos and carryings 
               on can be heard. Horses whinney in the corral. A few gunshots 
               are thrown into the soundtrack if things aren't lively enough.

               MISS ADRIAN'S CADILLAC, ON FIRE, roars out of the drive.

               Sissy looks up to the quiet mountain. Pauses. Then she looks 
               back to the chaos below.

               THE CINEMATOGRAPHERS' RENTED CONVERTIBLE AND THEIR EQUIPMENT 
               VAN drive away.

               Sissy sits and wonders. The sun is setting on the horizon, 
               mixing well with the firelight that the Rubber Rose is giving 
               off.

               BUT SHE is aware of something watching her. Looking about 
               she sees nothing.

               VIEW of an empty trail.

               VIEW OF a quivering bush.

               Sissy turns to the sound of the CHINK.

                                     CHINK
                         Ha ha ho ho hee hee.

               AND THERE HE IS. Standing only ten yards away.

               The Chink's problem is that he looks like he rolled out of a 
               Zen scroll, as if he says "presto" a lot, knows the meaning 
               of lightning and the origin of dreams. He LOOKS as if he 
               drinks dew and fucks snakes.

               Sissy and the Chink scrutinize one another with mutual 
               fascination.

                                     CHINK
                         Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

               Sissy is just about to speak, but before she does THE CHINK 
               whirls, and scampers up the mountainside.

                                     SISSY
                         Wait!

               Warily he stops and turns, poised to flee again.

               Sissy smiles.

               SHE RAISES her ripe right thumb. And jerking it and swooshing 
               it, she hitchhikes the Chink and his mountain.

               THERE HE STANDS where Sissy's thumbs have stopped him. The 
               Chink wears the wary look of a wild animal. He's not going 
               to stay stopped long. It is Sissy's move.

                                     SISSY
                         Well, aren't you going to shake your 
                         whanger at me?

               The Chink pauses for a moment, then he slaps his thighs and 
               giggles hysterically. Ha has, ho hos and hee hees squirt out 
               of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth.

                                     CHINK
                              (laughter dies a 
                              nervous chipmunk 
                              death)
                         Follow me. I'll fix you supper.

               THE TWO doggedly walk up the steep trail.

                                     SISSY
                         I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.

                                     CHINK
                         I know who you are.

                                     SISSY
                         Oh? Well, there's been some trouble 
                         on the ranch. I came up here to get 
                         out of the way. It's so dark now I 
                         doubt if I could find my way back 
                         down. If you could help...

                                     CHINK
                              (voice that wears no 
                              pants)
                         Save your breath for the climb.

               SISSY takes another look at the Rubber Rose, which is now 
               quiet. We can hear faintly a distant popping of washcloths 
               and girlish laughter.

               THEY make their way into a depression at the top of the 
               mountain down a ladder of sticks.

               THE CHINK lights a large fire in the middle of the depression.

               HE puts a kettle of stew over the fire, and begins to roast 
               yams.

               THE CHINK'S FACE as the fire dances off it.

               A CAN OF CHUNG KING water chestnuts is opened.

               CUT TO: Sissy and the Chink eating supper on a rough wooden 
               bench.

               AND AS THEY FINISH, the Chink goes into a cave and returns 
               with a tiny peppermint-stripped plastic transistor radio. He 
               switches it on and the silence is broken by "The Happy Hour 
               Polka."

               Still clutching the radio in one hand, the Chink hops into 
               the wheel of firelight and begins to dance.

               Sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and 
               toe, skip and hop. He flings his bones; he flings his beard.

                                     CHINK
                         Yip! Yip! Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

               Arms swimming, feet firecrackering, he dances and dances.

               When the song ends, the Chink puts the radio down as the 
               news comes on.

                                     CHINK
                         Personally, I prefer Stevie Wonder, 
                         but what the hell. Those cowgirls 
                         are always bitching because the only 
                         radio station in the area plays 
                         nothing but polkas, but I say you 
                         can dance to anything if you really 
                         feel like dancing.

               The Chink dances a little to the news, and then lifts Sissy 
               by her shoulders and guides her onto his pock-marked dance 
               floor.

                                     SISSY
                         But I don't know how to polka.

                                     CHINK
                         Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.

               The radio strikes up the "Lawrence Welk is a Hero of the 
               Republic Polka," and the Chink and Sissy dance arm in arm, 
               their shadows reel against the curves of the depression in 
               the mountain.

               Night birds fly past with fluttering feathers. A bat flies 
               out of the cave.

               The Chink escorts Sissy to a dark side of the depression and 
               sits her down upon a pile of soft stuff: dried wheatgrass, 
               faded Indian blankets and old down pillows without cases.

                                     SISSY
                              (thinking)
                         So this is how Jelly spends her visits 
                         to the Chink.

               A twanging noise sounds from the bowels of the nearby cave.

                                     SISSY
                         What was that?

                                     CHINK
                         Clockworks.

                                     SISSY
                         Clockworks?

               The Chink pauses to decide whether he should talk any further, 
               then proceeds.

                                     CHINK
                         The Clockworks is one reason that I 
                         am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted 
                         the invitation to be initiated as a 
                         shaman by an aged Siwash chief who 
                         was the principle outside confederate 
                         of the Clock People.

                                     SISSY
                         Siwash, huh?

                                     CHINK
                         He was a degenerated warlock who 
                         could turn urine into beer, and the 
                         honor that he extended me gave me 
                         rights of occupancy in this sacred 
                         cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. 
                         I came to the Dakota hills to 
                         construct a clockworks of my own.

               Sissy cradles her head in her arms, but is startled by a 
               louder noise from the clockworks. The Chink is startled too.

               Bonk! sounds the cave, and then it chimes poing!

               The Chink smiles at the noise coming from his clockworks.

                                     CHINK
                         But unlike the clockworks of the 
                         Clock People, my ticks more accurately 
                         echo the ticks of the universe....
                              (he listens)
                         ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

                                     SISSY
                         The Clock People?

               INT. CAVE NIGHT

               The Chink leads Sissy into the cave where we see his 
               clockworks. It is made of garbage can lids and old saucepans 
               and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with baling 
               wire. A bat flies into it making a bong noise and the 
               contraption moves a little.

                                     CHINK
                         During the Second World War I busted 
                         out of Tule Lake detention camp; as 
                         a Japanese-American, I had been put 
                         there and watched over. I found refuge 
                         with the Clock People, who discovered 
                         me in a snow bank, near dead, I had 
                         been climbing across the Sierra Nevada 
                         mountains.

                                     SISSY
                         Then if you are Japanese, then why 
                         are you called the Chink?

                                     CHINK
                         The Clock People mistook me for 
                         Chinese. And the name stuck. In the 
                         same way that all Indian tribes came 
                         to be labeled "Indians" through the 
                         ignorance of an Italian sailor with 
                         a taste for oranges, it is only 
                         fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. 
                         The Clock People, however, are not a 
                         tribe, rather they are a gathering 
                         of Indians from various tribes. They 
                         have lived together since 1906.

               INT. THE GREAT BURROW

               A gathering of the Clock People. A woman is giving birth 
               near the Giant timekeeping hourglass.

                                     CHINK
                         The pivotal function of the Clock 
                         People is the keeping and observing 
                         of the clockworks. It is a real thing, 
                         and is kept at the center, at the 
                         soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar 
                         as it is possible, all Clock People 
                         deaths and births occur in the 
                         presence of the clockworks. Aside 
                         from birthing or dying, the reason 
                         for the daily visits to the clockworks 
                         is to check the time.

               INT. SIWASH CAVE NIGHT

               Sissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's 
               clockworks.

                                     CHINK
                         These people have no other ritual 
                         than this one. Likewise, they have 
                         but one legend or cultural myth: 
                         that of a continuum they call the 
                         Eternity of Joy. It is into the 
                         Eternity of Joy that they believe 
                         all men will pass once the clockworks 
                         is destroyed. The destruction must 
                         come from the outside, must come by 
                         natural means, must come at the will 
                         of this gesticulating planet whose 
                         more acute stirrings thoughtless 
                         people call "earthquakes."

               The Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly.

                                     CHINK
                         The Earth is alive. She burns inside 
                         with the heat of cosmic longing. She 
                         longs to be with her husband again. 
                         She moans. She turns softly in her 
                         sleep. In the Eternity of Joy, 
                         pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease 
                         with his gentle technologies, will 
                         smile and sigh when the Earth begins 
                         to shake. I loved those loony 
                         redskins, but I couldn't be a party 
                         to their utopian dreaming. After a 
                         while it occurred to me that the 
                         Clock People waiting for the Eternity 
                         of Joy was virtually identical to 
                         the Christians waiting for the Second 
                         Coming. Or the Communists waiting 
                         for the worldwide revolution. Or the 
                         Debbies waiting for the flying 
                         saucers. All the same. Just more 
                         suckers betting their share of the 
                         present on the future, banking every 
                         misery on a happy ending to history. 
                         Well, history is ending every second - 
                         happily for some of us, unhappily 
                         for others, happily one second, 
                         unhappily the next. History is always 
                         ending and always not ending... ha 
                         ha ho ho and hee hee.

               Sissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is 
               worshipping her thumbs.

                                     SISSY
                         What do you believe in then?

                                     CHINK
                         Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

               Then he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They 
               sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside 
               the cave.

               Then the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He 
               squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, 
               telling them how beautiful they are.

               Sissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved 
               almost to tears.

               Sissy bends her head back and whispers.

                                     SISSY
                         If this be adultery, make the most 
                         of it.

               And as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread 
               bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway.

               Their bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of 
               ANCIENT BEINGS, anthropomorphs making love through the night 
               under the moon.

               INT. CAVE DAY

               SUNBEAMS awaken Sissy. When she looks around she sees an 
               inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall.

                       I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED.

               And on the left wall:

                       I BELIEVE IN NOTHING; EVERYTHING IS SACRED.

               Sissy hears and then sees A HELICOPTER in the sky above the 
               ranch. Sissy gets up and walks out of the cave.

               EXT. TRAIL MORN

               Sissy walks.

               EXT. RUBBER ROSE

               Sissy hitches a ride out of town.

               EXT. FRONT DOORSTEPS MORNING

               Countless NEWSPAPERS on countless porches, and the headline 
               of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reads:

               OUR WHOOPING CRANES ARE MISSING.

               INT. THE COUNTESS' OFFICE DAY

               The countess is in a snit.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're 
                         a good model but a shitty actress. 
                         The cowgirls are involved in this 
                         whooping crane disappearance. You 
                         know perfectly well they are. Last 
                         seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to 
                         Canada. Siwash Lake is between 
                         Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls 
                         have possession of Siwash Lake. And 
                         who else but Jellybean's wild cunts 
                         could possibly conceive of doing 
                         something so diabolical as to tamper 
                         with the last flock of some nearly 
                         extinct birds? How much do you know 
                         about it? Have they murdered those 
                         cranes the way they murdered my moo 
                         cows?

                                     SISSY
                         I don't know anything about it.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                         Sissy. You're trying to protect those 
                         scuzzy bitches. Well, let your 
                         conscience be your guide, as my mommy 
                         used to say, but it won't work. Those 
                         stinking sluts are going to suffer...

               Sissy strikes the Countess with her right thumb -- with 
               astonishing force.

               Immediately the thumb strikes again, this time shattering 
               the Countess's monocle against his eye.

                                     THE COUNTESS
                              (gasping)
                         Shit O dear.

               HIS DENTURES fall onto the shag rug.

               The left thumb strikes. Sissy is swinging her thumbs like 
               ballbats socking flaming homers over the left-field fence.

               The countess is out on his feet. His eyes are closed. His 
               legs wobble. He does a pathetic dance, like a drunken old 
               fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl.

               He topples forward and meets Sissy's onrushing thumb of 
               thunder which straightens him up, sends him over backward. 
               Motionless, he lies on the floor, a crimson part in his 
               thinning hair, a bright ooze at each nostril.

               INT. HOSPITAL DAY

               Seated on a spotless wooden bench is Sissy, staring at a 
               clock. A surgeon emerges.

                                     SURGEON
                         Well, he's not out of danger, but I 
                         think we can safely say he's going 
                         to make it. I'd be pretty surprised 
                         if he didn't. However, there is 
                         evidence of injury to the frontal 
                         lobe, and I have reason to fear that 
                         this injury may be permanent. The 
                         patient may never again function as 
                         a normal human being.

                                     SISSY
                         Brain damage? You mean he's going to 
                         be a vegetable?

                                     SURGEON
                         Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn't say 
                         that, no. We won't ascertain the 
                         extent of the injury for some days. 
                         But there is a genuine possibility 
                         of severe and lasting behavioral 
                         defects. I wouldn't classify it in 
                         the vegetable category, however.

               EXT. STREET DAY

               SISSY IS HITCHING OUT OF TOWN.

               A conservative blue Econoline van out of the throngs of 
               traffic draws itself to Sissy as if on a string.

               SISSY HOPS IN.

               INT. VAN DAY

               The DRIVER stomps on the gas. With a sense of disgust at her 
               own failure Sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow, his smug hot 
               leer, his starving eyes.

               Her heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife. He is 
               also unzipping his pants.

                                     DRIVER
                         I'm going to give it to you like 
                         you've never had it before. Oh, you 
                         didn't know it could be this good. 
                         You're gonna like it. You're gonna 
                         like it. You're gonna like it so 
                         good. You're gonna love it so much 
                         you're gonna cry. You're gonna cry. 
                         You're gonna cry and cry. Do you 
                         like to cry? Do you like it when it 
                         hurts a little bit? Whatever happens 
                         to you, it'll be worth it. The way 
                         I'm gonna give it to you, it'll be 
                         worth anything. Everything. Go ahead 
                         and cry if you want to. I like it 
                         when women cry. It means they 
                         appreciate me.

               EXT. STREET DAY

               The van pulls over down a dead end alley between warehouses.

               INT. VAN DAY

               Sissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress.

               The driver is taking his dick out of his pants. But with a 
               swift swoosh, Sissy's left thumb comes down hard on the penis 
               top, making the driver howl.

               His finger fumbles for the gun trigger, but before he gets 
               to it, Sissy's thumb splats between his eyes. Twice. Three 
               times. He loses control of the van.

               EXT. VAN DAY

               It lumbers into a street lamp. Sissy leaps from the vehicle 
               and runs.

               INT. WORKING MAN'S LUNCHEONETTE DAY

               Sissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks 
               at her thumbs.

               EXT. NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE DAY

               Into a sunset hitches Sissy.

               EXT. ROAD NIGHT

               SISSY hops into a semi.

               AND ROAD SIGNS:

                                       TRENTON N.J.

                                       BALTIMORE MD

               Then

                                       RICHMOND, VA

               EXT. DR. DREYFUS'S HOUSE DAY

               An older Dr. Dreyfus answers the door. Without Sissy's asking 
               he speaks.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         I'm afraid I can't help you.

                                     SISSY
                         But Doctor.

                                     DREYFUS
                         Please, child, don't be dismayed. We 
                         all have problems these days. But as 
                         the painter Van Gogh said, 'Mysteries 
                         remain, sorrow or melancholy remains, 
                         but the everlasting negative is 
                         balanced by the positive work which 
                         thus is achieved, after all.' I don't 
                         suppose that means very much to you. 
                         I have retired. A victim of a 
                         malpractice suit.

                                     SISSY
                              (embracing him)
                         Oh, Doctor! You've got to do it. You 
                         and nobody else should be allowed to 
                         take away my gift.

               In her embrace, the Doctor is presented with her thumbs.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         Ah, the thumb.

               LATER sitting inside his study, Dreyfus muses.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         The thumb the thumb the thumb the 
                         thumb the thumb the thumb. One of 
                         evolution's most ingenious inventions; 
                         a built-in tool sensitive to texture, 
                         contour and temperature: an alchemical 
                         lever; the secret key to technology; 
                         the link between the mind and art; a 
                         humanizing device. The marmoset and 
                         the lemur are thumbless; none of the 
                         New World monkeys has opposable 
                         thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs 
                         are absent or reduced to a tiny 
                         tubercle; the thumbs of the potto 
                         are set at an angle of one hundred 
                         eighty degrees to the other digits.

               Pause.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         And so you are demanding at last the 
                         privileges of thumb that nature has 
                         perversely denied you?

                                     SISSY
                         I just want to be normal, give me 
                         that old-fashioned normality. It was 
                         good enough for Crazy Horse and it's 
                         good enough for me.

                                     DR. DREYFUS
                         Ah, yes. Very well, my dear. Here is 
                         what we can do.

               VIEWS OF Sissy admitted to a hospital Blood analyzed in a 
               laboratory.

               Powerful lamps turn on in an operating room.

               IV tubes are inserted in veins.

               Sissy is wheeled into surgery.

               An anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy 
               ass.

               An anesthesiologist sticks needles into a long, graceful 
               neck.

               A nurse scrubs an arm.

               A body and table are draped with sheets to create a sterile 
               field.

               A tourniquet is placed on a slender right arm.

               An elastic rubber bandage is applied so tightly it squeezes 
               most of the blood out of an arm.

               A tourniquet is inflated.

               A surgeon outlines in iodine an incision around the base of 
               a thumb.

               Pale smooth skin is incised along a premarked line and 
               dissected down to the bone.

               Woman flesh is sewn shut with four-ought nylon suture.

               A tourniquet is deflated, a bloody arm bathed.

               A young woman is rolled into a recovery room.

               A nurse and two surgeons, their attention directed by an 
               intensifying pinkish glow, turn to stare into a metal pan, 
               where a huge human thumb, disarticulated from the hand it 
               has been severed from, is now flopping about like a trout, 
               or rather, arching and thrusting itself in a calculated and 
               endlessly repeated gesture, the gesture of the hitchhike.

               EXT. SKY DAY

               Two representatives of the Fish and Wildlife Service are 
               flying over Siwash Lake in a U.S. Forestry Service Helicopter.

               THEY CAN SEE the whooping cranes by the side of the lake. 
               And as they are recording this, shots from a band of young 
               women on horseback drive them away.

               EXT. RUBBER ROSE RANCH DAY

               the same two agents are driving in a truck approaching the 
               Rubber Rose Ranch. Two bullet ricochets spin off the hood 
               and roof of their truck and they stop to see a lone teenaged 
               cowgirl with a rifle.

               EXT. RUBBER ROSE GATES DAY

               An entourage of Forest Service Rangers, a county sheriff,

               Mottburg Gazette and a couple of bird watchers or two are 
               met by...

               AT LEAST FIFTEEN ARMED FEMALES at the gate of the Ranch. 
               Through a bullhorn, Jelly speaks out at the entourage of law 
               enforcement officers.

                                     JELLY
                         Yep, the whooping cranes are here 
                         all right. They're in fine shape, 
                         and as you musta saw from your fucking 
                         whirly machine, unrestrained, free 
                         to go as they please. But this is 
                         private property and you aren't laying 
                         a foot on it. None of you.

                         We'll be back with a court order and 
                         a fistful of search warrants.

                                     JELLY
                         Just come back with a couple of people 
                         who know what they're doing and we'll 
                         let'em in for a nice close look at 
                         the birds.

                                     DELORES
                         And make sure at least one of them 
                         is female, and you better do as we 
                         say or there may be trouble.

               AND OVER THE AIRWAVES an announcement is broadcast.

                         The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a 
                         communiqué that was sent to the 
                         federal judge and copies of a 
                         recording to the press, today.

               We can hear the voice of Bonanza Jellybean:

                                     JELLY
                              (over the radio)
                         THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS BEEN DRIVEN 
                         TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION BY AN 
                         AGGRESSIVE, BRUTAL PATERNALISTIC 
                         SYSTEM INTENT ON SUBDUING THE EARTH 
                         AND ESTABLISHING ITS DOMINION OVER 
                         ALL THINGS -- IN THE NAME OF GOD THE 
                         FATHER, LAW, ORDER AND ECONOMIC 
                         PROGRESS.

               Sissy recognizes the voice.

                                     SISSY
                         That's Jellybean!

                                     JELLY (V.O.)
                         FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS 
                         RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. 
                         MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, 
                         STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, 
                         POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, 
                         BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

               Jelly is on the telephone.

                                     JELLY
                         OBVIOUSLY, A PATERNALISTIC SOCIETY 
                         DOES NOT DESERVE ANYTHING AS GRAND 
                         AND BEAUTIFUL AND WILD AND FREE AS 
                         THE WHOOPING CRANE. YOU MEN HAVE 
                         FAILED IN YOUR DUTY TO THE CRANE. 
                         NOW IT IS WOMEN'S TURN. THE CRANES 
                         ARE IN OUR CHARGE NOW. WE WILL PROTECT 
                         THEM AS LONG AS THEY STILL REQUIRE 
                         PROTECTION --

               INT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM DAY

               Sissy listens to the radio.

                                     JELLY'S VOICE
                         WHILE WORKING TOWARD A DAY WHEN THE 
                         CREATURES OF THE WORLD NO LONGER 
                         HAVE TO SUFFER MAN'S EGOISM, 
                         INSENSITIVITY AND GREED. WE REFUSE 
                         YOUR ORDER. WE SAY TAKE YOUR ORDER 
                         AND SHOVE IT. THIS FLOCK OF BIRDS IS 
                         STAYING WITH US. GET LOST, MAC.

               EXT. ROAD DAY

               Sissy is hitchhiking with her new thumb. But cars pass one 
               after another without stopping. Until Sissy finally tries 
               her left thumb, which has been spared the knife.

               With this thumb there are new maneuvers to try out. And as 
               soon as the does, a car stops.

               MOSAIC of hitchhiking brilliance with Sissy's use of her 
               left thumb. A CLOCK IS TICKING past twelve then on to six 
               and past eight.... she dances wildly around traffic, stopping 
               the hardest of drivers, THE CLOCK TICKS AWAY and within thirty 
               hours she is approaching Mottburg again.

               EXT. RUBBER ROSE DAY

               The Ranch is now surrounded by two hundred federal marshalls 
               reinforced by a dozen FBI agents with loaded guns taking 
               position outside the ranch.

               Sissy gets out of her car and walks past the posse and through 
               the gates.

               Kym carries a radio which is playing "The Day-Old Apple 
               Strudel Polka" across the corral. She carries the radio as 
               if it is a suitcase full of skunk lice.

                                     KYM
                         Man, this is the stupidest music 
                         I've ever heard. This radio should 
                         have stayed in the privy where it 
                         belongs.

               Kym ropes the radio to her saddle horn and prepares to give 
               it a ride across the Dakota hills. She gets on her horse and 
               rides by the Ranch bungalows and spies Sissy sitting in the 
               outhouse.

                                     SISSY
                         Howdy.

               Kym gets off her horse and hugs Sissy.

                                     KYM
                         You know what you're getting into if 
                         you come over to the lake...

                                     SISSY
                         Yes, but I want to be there. I want 
                         to see Jellybean. I want to see the 
                         cranes.

               THEY RIDE ACROSS THE HILLS. Then they stop at an outlook and 
               Sissy sees the circular barricade in the field below.

                                     KYM
                         We heard on the radio that the judge 
                         has set Delores's bail at fifty 
                         thousand dollars. Now she won't be 
                         here when we really need her.

               EXT. CAMP DAY

               A few cowgirls in the camp huddle around a radio:

                                     RADIO NEWS REPORT
                         The American Civil Liberties Union 
                         has requested an extension for the 
                         Rubber Rose Ranch. The government is 
                         aware of the inflamed situation and 
                         are afraid that all the marshals and 
                         agents might be too willing to uncork 
                         the bottle of blood...

               SISSY RIDES INTO CAMP on the back of Kym's horse the way 
               that John Wayne would have ridden into the Alamo; Heather, 
               Bonanza Jellybean, Debbie, Elaine and Linda dance up to meet 
               her.

               Before Sissy is completely on the ground, Jelly's tongue is 
               in her mouth. She stumbles out of a stirrup into a wiggly 
               embrace.

                                     JELLY
                         Let's celebrate!

               Debbie stokes up a big joint right now, as Jelly gets out 
               her six guns and fires them in the air. Heather twirls and 
               jumps through her rope.

               The "Unsung Hero Returns Polka" strikes up on the radio.

               Elaine rears up on her horse.

               EXT. HILLSIDE DAY

               FROM AFAR, AN FBI AGENT views the little going on.

                                     AGENT
                         Ain't that just like women.

               But as the Agent is saying this, viewing them from the ridge, 
               a large rock tumbles down the hill and grazes his head, 
               knocking him out.

               VIEW of the side of the ridge from where the rock came, but 
               there is strangely nothing where we expect to see the Chink.

               BELOW: The cowgirls.

                                     JELLY
                         Looks like every time we get together 
                         things are in a mess.

                                     SISSY
                         So be it. It looks serious this time, 
                         though. All these guns... are you 
                         actually prepared to kill and die 
                         for whooping cranes?

                                     JELLY
                         Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, 
                         okay, but I'm not in this for whooping 
                         cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If 
                         we cowgirls give in to authority on 
                         this crane issue, then cowgirls become 
                         just another compromise. I want a 
                         finer fate than that -- for me and 
                         for every other cowgirl. Better no 
                         cowgirls at all than cowgirls 
                         compromised.

                                     SISSY
                         How did this business get started, 
                         anyhow? Why are the birds nesting 
                         here?

                                     DEBBIE
                         You were aware that we were feeding 
                         them, weren't you? We fed them brown 
                         rice and they stayed over a couple 
                         of extra days. Then we decided to 
                         try something different. We mixed 
                         our brown rice with fishmeal -- 
                         whoopers love seafood, and fishmeal 
                         is cheap. Then Delores suggested 
                         another ingredient, and we think 
                         that's what did the trick.

                                     SISSY
                         You mean...

                                     DEBBIE AND JELLY TOGETHER
                         PEYOTE!

                                     SISSY
                         They're drugged.

                                     JELLY
                         Aw, come off it, Sissy. What do you 
                         mean, 'drugged'? Every living thing 
                         is a chemical composition and anything 
                         that is added to it changes that 
                         composition. When you eat a 
                         cheeseburger or a Three Musketeers 
                         bar, it changes your body chemistry. 
                         The kind of food you eat, the kind 
                         of air you breathe, can change your 
                         mental state. Does that mean you're 
                         'drugged'?

               Sissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of her 
               cheese sandwich.

                                     SISSY
                         No, I guess not.

                                     JELLY
                         'Drugged' is a stupid word.

                                     SISSY
                         But the peyote is obviously affecting 
                         their brains. It's made them break a 
                         migratory pattern that goes back 
                         thousands of years.

                                     DEBBIE
                         The way I see it, is that the peyote 
                         mellowed them out. Made them less 
                         uptight. They were afraid of bad 
                         weather and humans. That's why they 
                         migrated and kept to themselves. But 
                         the peyote has enlightened them. 
                         It's taught them there is nothing to 
                         fear but fear itself. Now they're 
                         digging life and letting the bad 
                         vibes slide on. Don't worry, be happy. 
                         Be here now.

                                     SISSY
                         Fear in wild animals is completely 
                         different from paranoia in people. 
                         In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is 
                         natural and necessary. It's merely a 
                         mechanism for maintaining life. If 
                         the cranes hadn't had a capacity for 
                         fear, they would have disappeared 
                         long ago and you'd be having to get 
                         loaded with common old everyday 
                         meadowlarks and mallards.

                                     JELLY
                         This here discussion is destined to 
                         become academic. Because we've got 
                         less than half a bag of peyote buttons 
                         left and Delores's run ended up in 
                         the Mottburg jail. So any day now 
                         we'll get a chance to see how the 
                         whoopers behave when they come down, 
                         to see if the peyote experience really 
                         changed them or not. But in the 
                         meantime, I want to say this about 
                         fear.....

               Then Sissy and Jelly hear a news broadcast on the radio.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Judge Greenfield, at the request of 
                         the ACLU, has granted a forty-eight-
                         hour extension of the deadline by 
                         which the Rubber Rose cowgirls must 
                         comply with his order. Negotiations 
                         between the cowgirls and the 
                         government are expected to follow. 
                         Another item in, the forewoman of 
                         the Rubber Rose Ranch, a Delores del 
                         Ruby is now free on bond after having 
                         been arrested in Mottburg with more 
                         than fifty pounds of peyote buttons. 
                         Her bail has been paid by the owner 
                         of the besieged ranch, Countess

               Sissy and Jelly lie under the same stars, under the same 
               blankets. Under the same spell.

                         Every time I tell you that I love 
                         you, you flinch. But that's your

                         me, it's both our problems. My 
                         confusion becomes your confusion. 
                         Students confuse teachers, patients 
                         confuse psychiatrists, lovers with 
                         confused hearts confuse lovers with

               EXT. CAMPFIRE NIGHT

               Delores and some of the other cowgirls are talking. A sharp 
               wind is beginning to gust.

                         It isn't for ourselves that we take 
                         this stand. It isn't for cowgirls. 
                         It's for all the daughters everywhere. 
                         This is an extremely important 
                         confrontation. This is womankind's 
                         chance to prove to her enemy that 
                         she's willing to fight and die. If 
                         we women don't show here and now 
                         that we aren't afraid to fight and 
                         die, then our enemy will never take 
                         us seriously. Men will always know 
                         that, no matter how strong our words 
                         and determined our deeds, there's a 
                         point where we'll back down and give 
                         them their way.

               Delores cracks her whip then parades around the campfire.

               A few of the cowgirls cheer.

                         I'll fight the bastards.

               Big Red opens a can of beans with a Bowie knife.

                         In the morning we'll plan our fight. 
                         Tomorrow afternoon those of you who'd

                         the cranes and I will be sharing the 
                         last crumbs left in the peyote sack.

               EXT. SIWASH LAKE DAY

               Delores del Ruby appears from the reeds at Siwash Lake's 
               edge, asleep yet awake. She has sunk so deep into the hole 
               in her mind that gale and dust could not follow her.

               AS SHE APPROACHES THE COWGIRL CAMP, THEY GATHER AROUND HER 
               IN A TIGHT CIRCLE.

               MANY ARE TRANSFIXED as they listen.

                         It is woman's mission to destroy as 
                         well as to give birth. We will destroy 
                         the tyranny of the dull. But we can't 
                         destroy it with guns. Or whips. 
                         Violence is the dullard's Breakfast 
                         of Champions and the logical end 
                         product of his or her misplaced pride. 
                         Violence fertilizes that which we 
                         would starve. No, we will destroy 
                         the enemy in other ways. The Peyote 
                         Mother has promised a Fourth Vision. 
                         But it won't come to me alone. It 
                         will come to each of you, to every 
                         cowgirl in the land, when you have 
                         overcome that in your own self which 
                         is dull. The Fourth Vision will come 
                         to some men too. You will recognize 
                         them when you meet them, and be their 
                         steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic 
                         escapades of poetic behavior and 
                         romance.

               Delores holds up a card. The prairie moon illuminates its 
               tattered edges. It is the jack of hearts.

               The forewoman seems to be tiring. Fumes of weariness stream 
               from her black hair. Her voice is leaning against the wall 
               of her larynx when she says:

                         First thing, you must end this 
                         business with the government and the 
                         cranes. It's been positive and 
                         fruitful, but it's gone far enough. 
                         Playfulness ceases to serve a serious 
                         purpose when it takes itself too 
                         seriously. Sorry I won't be with you 
                         at the conclusion. As you know, I've 
                         been sick and stupid for a long time. 
                         I have a lot to make up for, a lot 
                         to accomplish, and there's someone 
                         important that I've got to see. Now.

               As graceful as a ballet for cobras, Delores turns and walks 
               away into the night.

               EXT. RANCH GATES DAY

               THE FBI, other VIGILANTES and POLICEMEN wait in anticipation 
               of an attack outside of the boundaries of the ranch.

               EXT. THE COWGIRL COMPOUND DAY

               Jelly is addressing the group of cowgirls.

                                     JELLY
                         Well, what we got to do is one of us 
                         has got to go up that hill and tell 
                         them boys that America can have its 
                         whooping cranes back. Since I'm the 
                         boss here, and since I'm responsible 
                         for a lot of you choosing to be 
                         cowgirls in the first place, it's 
                         gonna be me that goes...

               Small protests from the circle of cowgirls.

                                     JELLY
                         No buts about it. It's getting lighter 
                         by the second. You podners keep your 
                         heads down. Ta ta.

               The cutest cowgirl in the world stood up and stretched out.

                                     COWGIRL
                         Jelly! Please!

               But Jelly is already on her way.

               BONANZA JELLYBEAN VAULTS over the carcass of a reducing 
               machine and plants her Tony Lama boots in the stirrup of her 
               saddle and straddles her horse and takes off.

               EXT. COMPOUND DAY

               The posse surrounding the ranch, can see Jelly coming over 
               the hill on her horse at a full gallop.

               EXT. HILL DAY

               Jelly stops her horse, looks down at her waist, and sees her 
               sixguns.

                                     JELLY
                         Better get rid of these. Might give 
                         those greenhorn dudes a fright.

               THROUGH the scope of an FBI rifle, Jelly is drawing her gun 
               out of her holster.

                                     AGENT
                         She's going to fire....

               He squeezes the trigger, and Jelly is caught in the stomach 
               with a bullet. She falls off her horse to the ground.

               THE CHINK sees Bonanza Jellybean cut down from a vantage 
               point on the hill, and makes a beeline for the government 
               barricades, SHOUTING.

               THE COWGIRLS scream and cry, and grab their weapons. A couple 
               of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled.

               EXT. HILL DAY

               The six-gun slips from her fingers.

               Twenty or thirty more sweaty triggers are squeezed on the 
               hilltop firing at Bonanza Jellybean.

               THE CHINK RUNNING AND SHOUTING.

               EXT. COWGIRL CAMP DAY

               A VOICE OVER THE BULLHORN directed at the cowgirls echoes:

                                     VOICE
                         You've got two minutes to come out 
                         with you hands over your heads!

               RANDOM G-MEN are sniping at the cowgirls, making it impossible 
               to surrender.

               A stray bullet SENDS THE CHINK back down the hillside, beard, 
               robe and sandals flying.

               IN THE HUSH that follows, in the echoes of the explosive 
               fire, the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of 
               beating feathers - a lily white storm of life, a gush of 
               albino Gabriels -- swarm into the waiting sky, and circle 
               the pond one time before flapping south toward Texas...

               ...they cast shadows over a dead Jellybean who is literally 
               biting the dust.

               Sissy lifts Jelly out of the dust and holds her. Sissy lifts 
               Jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her 
               skirt. Bright red blood is running out of her scar.

                                     JELLY
                         Right in the scar where I fell on a 
                         wooden horse when I was twelve. Haw, 
                         I wasn't really shot with a silver 
                         bullet.

               Confessing to Sissy.

                                     JELLY
                         Or was I?

               A brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road.

                         not seem out of place in nature. 
                         Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, 
                         like the fossilized brain of a dryad; 
                         its kinship to tree (to knot and 
                         nest) unobscured by the cruel crush 
                         of industry; absorbing the elements 
                         like any other organic entity; 
                         blending with rock and vegetation as 
                         if it were a burrowing owl's door 
                         mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a 
                         No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded 
                         in the hills of Dakota and appeared 
                         to live where it lay. Once long ago, 
                         it had borne a package of buns and a 
                         jar of mustard to a kitchenette 
                         rendezvous with a fried hamburger. 
                         More recently, the bag had 
                         held........ love letters.

               View of a bunkhouse trunk.

                                     VOICE
                         As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's 
                         family jewels, the bag had hidden 
                         love letters in the bottom of a 
                         bunkhouse trunk.

               Hands lift the contents of the trunk away, rope, spurs, and 
               blanket and find the hidden sack of letters.

                                     VOICE
                         Then one day after work, the button-
                         nosed little cowgirl to whom the 
                         letters were addressed gathered bag 
                         and contents under her arm, slipped 
                         out to the corral...

               We see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day.

                         ...past ranch hands pitching 
                         horseshoes and ranch hands flying 
                         Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted 
                         into the hills.

               We see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge.

                                     VOICE
                         A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she 
                         dismounted and built a small fire; 
                         she fed the fire letters.

               And this we see also, the lonely Cowgirl feeding the letters 
               to a fire in the dusky early night. We can see the cowgirl 
               is Sissy Hankshaw.

                                     VOICE
                         ...one by one, the way her girl friend 
                         had once fed her french fries.

               She is crying now and feeding the fire, close of words like 
               "always" and "forever" burning up.

                                     VOICE
                         As words such as sweetheart" and 
                         "honey britches" and "forever" and 
                         "always" burned away, the cowgirl 
                         squirted a few tears. Her eyes were 
                         so misty she forgot to burn the bag.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE NIGHT

               Sissy is sobbing.

               Big Red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no surprise 
               when Sissy refuses it.

               Kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl, and 
               the bunkhouse lights go out.

               Delores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson, looks up at 
               the moon.

                                     DELORES
                         You know, podner, you can tune a 
                         guitar but you can't tuna fish.

               She plunks a few notes.

                                     DELORES
                         God, but it's good to be a cowgirl.

               And the bunkhouse lights are turned off. There are some 
               giggles from the cowgirls.

               INT. MAIN BEDROOM RANCH DAY

               THE CHINK wakes up and is being cared for by Sissy. He is in 
               pain, but winking.

                                     SISSY
                         Is everything getting worse?

                                     CHINK
                         Yes, everything is getting worse. 
                         But everything is also getting better.

                                     SISSY
                         The Countess has come to our aid. 
                         The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially 
                         deeded to all the cowgirls. And I 
                         have been asked to oversee the ranch. 
                         For $300 a week. And as it turns 
                         out, the Countess is not going to be 
                         the vegetable the doctors thought he 
                         was... here's a picture!

               Sissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a hospital 
               bed, posing next to Doctor Robbins.

                                     CHINK
                         I want to go back to the Clock People. 
                         I kind of miss those fool redskins 
                         and wonder what they're up to. What's 
                         happened to Jelly?

                                     SISSY
                         She had a one way-ticket to Kansas 
                         City.

                                     CHINK
                         You mean she's dead?

               The Chink mourns a bit.

                                     SISSY
                         But that's an old story now...... I 
                         can't believe that you would leave 
                         the Butte.

                                     CHINK
                         Easy come, easy go.

                                     DELORES
                         Wow, you sure have a way with words.

               The Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing in 
               the doorway.

                                     CHINK
                         I can't help it if I grew up in an 
                         antipoetic culture. Language will be 
                         different when I'm with the Clock 
                         People though. They're from an oral 
                         tradition. And I'm not talking about 
                         what you horny hop toads do in bed 
                         every night.

               The Chink smiles.

               Delores blushes.

                                     SISSY
                         Well, if the Clock People give you 
                         any inside information on the end of 
                         the world, drop us a postcard.

                                     CHINK
                         The world isn't going to end, you 
                         dummy; I hope you know that much.
                              (he grows 
                              uncharacteristically 
                              serious)
                         But it is going to change. It's going 
                         to change drastically, and probably 
                         in your lifetime. The Clock People 
                         see calamitous earthquakes as the 
                         agent of change, and they may be 
                         right, since there are a hundred 
                         thousand earthquakes a year and major 
                         ones are long overdue. But there are 
                         far worse catastrophes coming... 
                         unless the human race can bring itself 
                         to abandon the goals and values of 
                         civilization, in other words, unless 
                         it can break the consumption habit -- 
                         and we are so conditioned to consuming 
                         as a way of life that for most of us 
                         life would have no meaning without 
                         the yearnings and rewards of 
                         progressive consumption. It isn't 
                         merely that our bad habits will cause 
                         global catastrophes, but that our 
                         operative political-economic 
                         philosophies have us in such a blind 
                         crab grip that they prevent us from 
                         preparing for the natural disasters 
                         that are not our fault. So the 
                         apocalyptic shit is going to hit the 
                         fan, all right, but there'll be some 
                         of us it'll miss. Little pockets of 
                         humanity. Like the Clock People. 
                         Like you two honeys, if you decide 
                         to accept my offer of a lease on 
                         Siwash Cave. There's almost no 
                         worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear 
                         accident, plague, weather warfare or 
                         reduction of the ozone shield -- 
                         that you couldn't survive in that 
                         cave.

               He begins to caress Sissy's belly. His eyes are smiling. 
               Sissy is surprised.

                                     CHINK
                         Suppose that you bear five or six 
                         children with your characteristics. 
                         All in Siwash Cave. In a 
                         postcatastrophe world, your offspring 
                         would of necessity intermarry, forming 
                         in time a tribe. A tribe every member 
                         of which had giant thumbs. A tribe 
                         of Big Thumbs would relate to the 
                         environment in very special ways. It 
                         could not use weapons or produce 
                         sophisticated tools. It would have 
                         to rely on its wits and its senses. 
                         It would have to live with animals -- 
                         and plants! -- as virtual equals. 
                         It's extremely pleasant to me to 
                         think about a tribe of physical 
                         eccentrics living peacefully with 
                         animals and plants, learning their 
                         languages, perhaps, and paying them 
                         the respect they deserve.

                                     SISSY
                         How am I going to be the progenitor 
                         of a tribe when I'm living on an 
                         isolated ridgetop with Delores?

                                     CHINK
                         That's your problem.

               The Chink coughs.

                                     CHINK
                         Listen to the way I'm babbling. That 
                         bullet must have loosened one of my 
                         transistors. Don't pay any attention 
                         to me. You've got to work it out for 
                         yourself. The westbound choo-choo 
                         leaves Mottburg at one-forty. I want 
                         to be on it. Will you drive me to 
                         the station?

               INT. TRUCK DAY

               Sissy and Delores are driving the Chink out the front gate 
               of the Rubber Rose.

                                     CHINK
                         Schedules! Ironic how I have to follow 
                         timetables in order to get back to 
                         the clockworks.

               He yells out the window of the moving vehicle.

                                     CHINK
                         Don't ever bet against paradox, 
                         ladies...

               EXT. THE RUBBER ROSE GATES

               We hear the Chink yelling, and the Rubber Rose sign is being 
               changed to one that reads El Rancho Jellybean.

                                     CHINK
                         ....if complexity doesn't beat you, 
                         then paradox will. Ha ha ho ho and 
                         hee hee.....

               And the truck disappears into the prairie land.

               A LONG DARK PAUSE, UNTIL finally we are inside the cave where 
               the Chink's Clockworks are at work..... poing!

               It is revealed that Sissy is with Delores snug in the old 
               hermit's living quarters. She listens to the clinking of the 
               Chink's Clockworks.

               And feels her belly.

               The swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back.

               CLOSE VIEW of Sissy's belly, and a little foot kicks from 
               inside. Or is it a foot?

               VIEW INSIDE THE BELLY of Sissy's unborn baby. It is half-
               Japanese, one thirty-second Siwash and all thumbs.

               The moving thumbs are hitchhiking you.....

                                         THE END

                         BEGIN CREDITS:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
          company of about 50 - 75 employees.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
          We PAN up to the main office.

          INSIDE THE OFFICE
          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
          phone with his friend DEAN.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You should come by tonight. Half
          price well drinks while the game's
          going.

                         JOEL
          You always give me free drinks
          though.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... Might as well. No action
          going on at my house, that's for
          sure.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Really? The wife out of town?

                         JOEL
          No... I just haven't been laid in
          a month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You guys having problems or
          something?

                         JOEL
          No. This is pretty much normal
          these days...
          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
          through various stages of assembly line production, then
          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
          says sound as macho and important as possible.

                         STEP
          You get this job through Manpower?

                         HECTOR
          Yeah.

                         STEP
          I started here with Manpower too.
          Started out on the line just like
          you.

                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)
           Only I did better... 40 crates a
          day. 
          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.

                         STEP (CONT'D)
          I'm the best sorter in here.
          That's why they made me full time
          with benefits. I'll probably be
          floor manager this year.
          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
          to be out of style by now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.

                         RORY
          (hands them each a flier)
          My band's playing this Friday, come
          check us out.
          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
          Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
          flier.
          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
          forties.

                         MARY
          You see that... That new guy.
          He's holding us up. It's not my
          job to tell them to hold the line
          either.

                         GABRIELLA
          And then Joel's gonna come yell at
          us, cuz he's not doing his job.

                         MARY
          (folds her arms, fed up)
          I'm just gonna sit here.

                         GABRIELLA
          You're not gonna shut it off?

                         MARY
          I'm not gonna hold the line. If
          they're not gonna do their job, why
          should I do mine.
          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
          the conveyor belt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.

                         JOEL
          If I don't get home before about
          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
          and once the sweatpants are on,
          it's over -- I get nothing.
          (notices something down

                         BELOW)
          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
          back.
          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.

          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.

                         STEP
          What are you doing?!

                         MARY
          What are YOU doing?!
          (pointing at Hector)
          What is he doing?
          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          All right. Now, what's the
          problem?
          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
          It's gonna take him a couple of
          days, maybe his English isn't so
          good. You gotta be patient.

                         STEP
          That's what I was tryin' to say.

                         JOEL
          And Step, if you wanna be Floor
          Manager, this is the kind of thing
          you're going to have to deal with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         STEP

                         (KISS-ASS)
          Exactly.

                         JOEL
          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
          get this cleaned up, and get
          rolling again. We can't afford to
          fall behind today.
          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
          right back up with Gabriella.

                         MARY
          You see that? We always get the
          blame.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.

                         JOEL 
          Jesus... They're like a bunch of 
          goddamned children. 

                         BRIAN
          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
          the drama; I was showing boy-genius
          down there how to back up a
          forklift.
          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as 
          he passes someone. 

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          That's his whole career, driving
          that damn forklift. You'd think
          he'd wanna learn how.

                         JOEL 
          Well, I guess he's got that band 
          he's in too... 

                         BRIAN
          (disgust at the word

                         "BAND")
          "Band", ugh...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          I'll bet dollars to donuts he sucks
          at that too. Then you got ah...
          (tries to remember her
          name but can't)
          Dinkus down there...

                          JOEL 
          Who, Mary? 

                          BRIAN
          No, the other one -- what's-her-
          face -- she asked me -- or rather
          "axed" me -- for more personal
          days. Just like that. I told her
          maybe if she figures out how to
          fill out the time sheets correctly
          I'll give her more personal days...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Don't worry, she will never fill
          out her time sheets correctly.
          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: 
           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and 
           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of 
          old hens. 

          JOEL (O.S.)
          Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby
          sitting these assholes.
          (looks at his watch)
          I better get going...
          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about 
          "sweatpants." 

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
          when he sees something.

                         JOEL'S POV:
          NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out
          to the street to get his mail.

                         JOEL
          (to himself, praying)
          Please go back inside... Please
          just turn around.. .Come on...don't
          notice me...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
          crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
          him.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Shit!
          Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
          begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
          can talk to him.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
          Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
          leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
          trapping Joel.

                         NATHAN
          How've ya been? I left you a
          message last week. I don't know if
          you got it or not.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
          in a hurry here.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? You been busy?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, in fact...
          (checks his watch)
          I should go right now actually. I
          gotta call the office before they
          leave.

                         NATHAN
          Well, real quick while I got ya
          here -- what're you guys doing
          November 17th?

                         JOEL
          Ah, I don't ah...
          (realizes his should fake

                         IT)
          Actually we're going to be out of
          town that weekend.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? Where you going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         JOEL
          Ah...

                         NATHAN
          Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I
          meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th.
          You'll be in town then right?

                         JOEL

                         (DEFEATED)
          Ah...Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          Great. There's this dinner Leslie
          and I are going to. It's an annual
          thing -- we do it every year with
          the Rotary Club -- it's for
          charity. It's just a whole lot of
          fun, and we wanted to invite you
          and Suzie to be our guests at our
          table. It's--

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't
          think that's something we're gonna
          want to do.

                         NATHAN
          Really? Why not? It's a lot of
          fun.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't
          really like going to stuff like

                         THAT--

                         NATHAN
          Why not?

                         JOEL
          Well, we wouldn't know anybody
          there. She get's kind of
          uncomfortable.

                         NATHAN
          Oh no -- It's not like that. She
          won't be uncomfortable. I
          guarantee it. No, it's not like
          that at all. It's not formal or
          anything. Trust me. It's just a
          real loose bunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         JOEL
          I just don't...

                         NATHAN
          I tell you what. Why don't we do
          this -- I'll go ahead and get
          tickets, since they're gonna sell
          out fast. You talk to Suzie. See
          what she says. Like I say, she
          won't be uncomfortable at all.
          Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
          call -- you know how it is when the
          wives talk, heh heh--
          Joel is about to snap.

                         JOEL
          Um, why don't we talk about this
          later.
          (looks at his watch)
          I gotta make this call before they
          leave.
          Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Sorry... I just gotta make this
          call!

          INT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan
          right there in his garage.

                         NATHAN
          Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
          tickets are forty dollars a plate.
          I know that's a little steep, but
          the food is fantastic and it's for
          a good cause. So that'd be eighty
          dollars total. There's no tax or
          anything.

                         JOEL
          Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
          inside and make this call. Let's
          talk about this another time.
          Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
          waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, and if you need us to look out
          for the house or anything when you
          go out of town --
          Joel's finger still on the garage door button.

                         NATHAN
          Well, just let us know. Where you
          guys going anyway?

                         JOEL

                         (BULLSHITTING)
          Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look,
          I gotta run.
          Joel hits the button and the door starts going down.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then. We'll see ya.
          Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
          sigh of relief. Then,

          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
          As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
          towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
          goes down.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, Joel one more thing--
          Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
          enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
          disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
          woman, about Joel's age.

                         JOEL
          Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, what an asshole. I don't
          even go into the front yard
          anymore. That wife of his is even
          worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off.
          Joel sits down next to her.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I
          don't think that asshole checked
          the chlorine levels again like I
          asked him too...
          Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She
          doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .and every time he is here, he
          goes on and on about some problem
          with the goddamn filter, and I have
          no idea what he's talking about...
           Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He 
          gets closer, starts kissing her neck.

                          SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Ah,...Joel?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         SUZIE
          I'm sorry. It's just... I'm a
          little tired, and, I don't know,
          it's the middle of the week...

                         JOEL
          It's not the middle of the week.
          It's Monday. Why can't--

                         SUZIE
          Monday?
          (Freezes, suddenly

                         REALIZING SOMETHING)
          Oh shit!

                         JOEL

                         (WORRIED)
          What?!

                         SUZIE
          Idol!
          Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and
          turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Suzie plops down in a Barcalounger.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend.
          Joel leaves the room.

          INT. JOEL'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          [Quick scene of Joel trying to masturbate (off screen of
          course), but he's too distracted by the sounds of a bad out-
          of-tune Idol audition blaring through the wall.] 

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday
          Inn.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS

          Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late
          forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on
          a stool.

                         JOEL
          I gotta get a house with a bathroom
          that's doesn't share a wall with
          the TV.

                         DEAN
          Why don't you do that in another
          bathroom. You've got three of 'em.

                         JOEL
          It would look suspicious. We never
          use those other bathrooms... Maybe
          if I had some insulation put in...

                         DEAN
          Insulation?... All I know is, you
          shouldn't move man; you've got a
          nice house. I mean you've got the
          American dream really -- you own
          your own company. I can't believe
          you used to bar back for me here,
          and now you've got all that.

                         JOEL
          But what do I have really? It's a
          big pain in the ass.

          13.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I'm always working; can't stop or
          the whole place will fall apart.
          And what good does it do me anyway?
          I don't get laid. That stock guy
          with the shitty band that works for
          me probably gets laid more than I
          do.

                         DEAN
          (trying to help)
          Yeah, but he probably lives in a
          crappy apartment.

                         JOEL
          Hell, I'd move into a crappy
          apartment if the bathroom wasn't
          right next to the TV.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

          CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
          looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
          the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
          beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
          vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
          Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
          goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
          attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
          this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
          other trying to help her.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Yeah, it's expensive but it's
          sweet... Are you familiar with the
          Gibson humbucking pickups?

                         CINDY
          No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
          my Dad actually -- for his
          fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
          I are all pitching in.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would
          love these humbuckings. They
          really kick ass.
          An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
          trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
          He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         MALE CUSTOMER
          Excuse me... I just have a quick
          question...
          Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy.

                         SALESMAN #2

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          So, what kind of music did he play?
          Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer
          finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard
          room.

                         CINDY
          I think he played like, jazz or
          something. I'm not sure.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Well this is an excellent jazz
          guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
          plays.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Is your Dad into Metheny at all?

                         CINDY
          Oh, I don't know who that is.
          Sorry.

                         SALESMAN #2
          He's like, a totally kickass fusion
          guitarist. Are you into fusion?

                         CINDY
          I don't really know much about
          it...

                         SALESMAN #2
          I play fusion guitar so... Just
          curious.

                         CINDY
          Um, do they come in any other
          colors?

                         SALESMAN #1
          You mean different finishes?
          There's a sunburst finish we might
          have in stock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Yeah, do you wanna see it? I'll go
          get it.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Or I could go. Whatever.

                         CINDY
          Are you sure?

                         SALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2
          Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show
          you the case it comes with too.
          The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
          back to find the other guitar.
          Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
          casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
          out the front door with it.

          EXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

           Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
           the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

          The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
          guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
          around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
          disappointed, before they realize what just happened.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Oh shit!...

                         (FRANTICALLY LOOKING

                         AROUND)

          THE GIBSON!
          They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited.

                         BRIAN
          You're not gonna believe this.
          Remember the guy from General Mills
          that called a while back? Talking
          like he wanted to buy us out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         JOEL
          I thought you said he wasn't
          serious; he was just sniffing
          around.

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well he's serious now. He
          just made an offer -- I mean a real
          offer this time.

                         JOEL
          You're kidding.

                         BRIAN
          No. It must be part of some bigger
          strategic move, because it's over
          market value I think.

                         JOEL
          Wow...
          Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking
          down on the production floor.

                         JOEL
          I could unload all this... I could
          probably retire...

                         BRIAN
          I mean, yeah, there's a lot of
          details to work out, but this could
          be great. They'll be calling back
          next week, what should I tell them?
          Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded,
          shaking her head.

                         JOEL
          Tell 'em hell yes.

          Mary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line.

          bottles shatter.
          - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of
          goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle.
          - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a
          huge stack of pallets to fall off.
          - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion.
          - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the

          Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter
          by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to
          comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch.
          ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.

                         MARY
          I knew it. That's what happens
          when you don't pay attention.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- LATER

          Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind the
          bar on a stool.

                         JOEL
          (to the person on the

                         PHONE)
          Uh-huh... Alright. Let me know if
          you hear anything else.
          He hangs up, talks to Dean.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Well, he's definitely lost one of
          'em. They think they might be able
          to re-attach the other one, but
          they're not sure.

          Wow...

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm not sure how it
          happened, but we have a great
          safety record and we comply with
          all the safety codes so... it was
          just a freak accident. There'll be
          an investigation of some kind I'm
          sure.

                         DEAN
          Well, you have insurance for that
          kind of thing, right?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Of course. In fact,
          he'll probably get a huge
          settlement.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I would think so. I mean,
          it's your balls...
          Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.

                         JOEL
          Boy it really makes you stop and
          think about how fragile we are --
          especially our balls. They're just
          hanging there in a little sack
          between our legs. At any moment
          they could be cut off forever.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. And your balls are really
          important man. Your balls are
          everything. What kind of life would
          you have with no testicles? Can you
          imagine that shit?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You know Dean, my life wouldn't be

          Except for once every three months
          when I have sex with my wife. In
          fact, I might even be better off...

                         DEAN
          Wait. Three months? I thought you
          said it was once a month.

                         JOEL
          I did? I must've been lying. I
          don't know... Maybe things'll get
          better when I sell the company.
          I'll be around more...

                         DEAN
          Well, I hope so. That would
          suck... I get laid all the time.
          (off Joel's reaction)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          Ah, it's all right...

                         (THINKS)
          Actually, it sucks.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, sexual frustration is bad
          news... You know what you oughtta
          do?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          Get some Xanax.

                         JOEL
          Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

                         DEAN
          Yeah it is, but I find it's good
          for just about any phsychological
          problem. I mean, basically it just
          makes you feel good, so it sort of
          works for anything. I even take it
          when I have a cold. It's probably
          great for sexual frustration. Want
          me to get you some?

                         JOEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         DEAN
          You know what else is good?
          Codeine cough syrup.

                         JOEL
          For what?

                         DEAN
          It's just good.
          Joel looks at Dean for a beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Are you on something now?

                         DEAN
          No... Well, I guess I took some
          Vicodin this morning. But that was
          just 'cause I was hung-over.

          EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall. Cindy's car
          parked out in front.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Cindy is at the counter, the Gibson guitar we saw earlier is
          in front of her. A PAWN SHOP GUY is counting out money. He
          pauses, looks around, then speaks sympathetically to her.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          Um, you know, I'm really not
          supposed to say this... but since
          this belonged to your father, and
          since he passed away and all...

                         (QUIETLY)
          You could probably get a better
          deal at a music store.

                         CINDY
          Oh, that's okay. Thanks. But I
          just kind of wanna get it over
          with, you know? It's kind of hard
          for me.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          I understand.
          He looks around to see if his boss is watching, then counts
          off a FEW MORE TWENTIES, feeling sorry for her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
           PAWN SHOP GUY (cont'd)
          Here.

          INT. CINDY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Cindy puts the money in her wallet, along with a driver's
          license.

          CLOSE ON THE WALLET.
          Cindy shuffles through three or four different driver's
          licenses. On one, her name says MISTY PATTERSON. It's a
          Kansas license. She takes another one out from Colorado,
          with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front,
          then puts the wallet away.
          A newspaper sits on the front seat. Something grabs her
          attention.

          ANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER:
          We see an article about Step's accident. There's a picture
          of Step being taken away on the stretcher.
          Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.

                         CINDY'S POV:
          She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words,
          ".. .potentially big settlement..." "...no testicles..."
          "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
          quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
          testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
          ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
          more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"
          Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract."
          She starts the car and speeds away.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Joel sits with Brian. Brian has a clipboard, going over the 
          day's business. 

                         BRIAN
          So obviously Step's not coming back
          anytime soon. I had to hire a
          couple temps. Is that okay?

                         JOEL 
          Yeah, sure. How is Step? 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         BRIAN
          Better. They say he's going home
          in a couple of days. Speaking of
          which, the guys at General Mills
          heard about this whole Step thing.
          They're worried. If Step decides
          to sue us -- beyond the insurance
          settlement -- it could be a serious
          liability. They don't want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled.

                         JOEL 
          Really? They think it's that big 
          of a liability? 

                         BRIAN
          Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
          think about it. Imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
          balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars. Seriously --
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something. Would you?

                         JOEL 
          No, I guess not. 

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
          he's not going to sue us. Says he

                         (CRUDE IMITATION)
          "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
          and "What's right is right." If we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine.

                         JOEL 
          Boy, Step sure is being mellow 
          about all this. 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well I think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out. You
          don't get as pissed off and
          aggressive about things. I know
          it's true for horses, and bulls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JOEL
          Boy, it sure does make you think.. 

                         BRIAN 
          Oh, by the way, guess who asked for 
          a raise today? 

                         JOEL 
          Who? 

                         BRIAN

                         (GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY
          to someone downstairs)
          Dinkus. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          Brian, you call everyone here
          "Dinkus." I don't know who you're
          talking about.

                         BRIAN 
          You know, Forklift-Dinkus? 

                         JOEL 
          Oh... I thought you call him "boy- 
          genius." 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a
          raise. I said, "are you kidding?
          You nearly got someone killed last
          week," and then he blamed it on
          Dinkus over there.

                         JOEL 
          You know Brian, you really ought to 
          learn the employees' names. 

                         BRIAN
          Well, I was thinking about that,
          but hey, if this deal goes through
          next week, I won't have to. It's
          not like I'm gonna be inviting
          Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for
          dinner.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a
          long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes
          in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production
          floor with Joel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa!
           DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on
          the assembley line.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          Damn! Who's she? Is she new?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. She's a temp.

                         DEAN
          She's a tramp?

                         JOEL
          No a temp. Quit staring.

                         DEAN
          Damn, she's hot! Way to go.

                         JOEL
          Hey, I didn't hire her. She came
          here through Manpower, like
          everybody else. They just sent her
          over.

                         DEAN
          Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give
          them a call. You don't usually
          have girls anywhere near that hot
          working here. What's the deal?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know. I guess it makes
          sense though if you think about it.
          Hot girls need a job just as much
          as anyone else.

                         DEAN
          (thinks for a second)
          Do they really?... Huh... You just
          don't see 'em here. Usually your
          temps look like winos. And they're
          guys.

                         JOEL
          You wanna hear something really
          weird?

                         DEAN
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         JOEL
          She came on to me.

                         DEAN
          No way! Really?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I
          could be wrong, but...

                         DEAN
          Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you
          kidding? You could have any girl
          down there.

                         JOEL
          I don't know about that.

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. Dude, you're the big
          shot here. You're the king of...
          What do you call that shit you make
          here again?

                         JOEL
          Extract. And spray-dried
          flavoring, and we're branching out

                         INTO--

                         DEAN
          Yeah, you're the Extract King man.
          You could have any girl here. I
          mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em,
          but her... Way to go Joel.
          Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          So how did she come on to you?

                         JOEL
          Well, first she started asking me
          about what happened to Step and all
          that stuff -- you know, just sort
          of making conversation?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          But it really seemed like she was
          flirting with me, you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Then, she just sort of asked me
          out... I think.

                         DEAN
          Really? How?

                         JOEL
          Well, you see that guy down there
          by the fork lift?
          ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          His band is playing somewhere, at
          some party this weekend, and she
          asked me if I wanted to go with
          her.

                         DEAN
          Wow. So, you gonna do anything
          about it?

                         JOEL
          What? No. No way. I couldn't
          live with myself if I cheated on
          Suzie... It'd be nice if I got
          laid at home once in a while
          though...

                         DEAN
          (still staring at her)
          Man, she is fine. You mind if I
          hit that then?
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I do sort of...
          We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the
           Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT / MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS


                         ACTION
          Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical.

                         MARY
          My purse is stolen! It's gone!
          (pointing at Hector)
          He did it! He stole my purse!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          Brian runs over and stands between them, trying to calm Mary
          down, but she keeps ranting. Hector looks confused and
          worried.

                         BRIAN
          Now hold on--

                         MARY
          I won't hold on! I'll call the
          cops!

                         HECTOR
          (confused, frightened)
          What? I don'... No comprende...

                         BRIAN

                         (HORRIBLE SPANISH)
          Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes
          donde esta su... uh, purse?
          ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing-- completely
          unfazed.Joel rushes in.

                         JOEL
          Now wait a second. Calm down Mary.
          How do you know it was stolen?

                         MARY
          It's gone! That's how.

                         JOEL
          Well, what did it look like.

          INT. CINDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON

          Cindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary
          just described. She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket,
          then finds what she's looking for -- the address book.

          ANGLE ON ADDRESS BOOK.
          Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson. She notes
          his address. She starts the car and takes off.

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STEP'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very
          blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from
          Step's house, keeping an eye on it.
          After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his
          pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts
          the car and follows from a distance.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - A LITTLE LATER

          Step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines.
          He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk. Cindy gets in
          line behind him. She only has one item, a bottle of
          Reynold's Orange Extract. Step notices her.

                         STEP
          You can go ahead of me if that's
          all you have.

                         CINDY

                         (SWEETLY)
          Thank you so much.
          (holds up extract bottle)
          I can't believe I'm buying this
          stuff -- I work at the factory.

                         STEP
          Really? I work there too. Or, ah,
          I used to.

                         CINDY
          Really? You're kidding! I just
          started there. What's your name?

                         STEP
          I go by Step. Yeah, I'm the
          fastest sorter there...

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Joel enters the living room. He first sees the sweatpants,
          then sees Suzie is sound asleep on the couch. He sighs, then
          turns and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking some
          kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz.

                         JOEL
          I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of
          being turned down in my own house
          by my own wife. We're turning into
          one of those brother-sister
          couples.

                         DEAN
          Huh...Now that you mention it, you
          guys kind of look alike too.

                         JOEL

                         (GROSSED OUT)
          No we don't!

                         DEAN
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          (takes a drink)
          Maybe things will be better after I
          sell the company... Or maybe it's
          just going to mean more time to sit
          around and contemplate not getting
          laid.
          Dean nods sympathetically.

                         DEAN
          What about that girl at work? She
          still into you?

                         JOEL
          Yeah... she was really coming on to
          me. She gave me her phone number
          and everything. Told me to call
          her if I wanted to go to that
          party. Can you believe that? And
          there's nothing I can do about it,
          but just be sexually frustrated.

                         DEAN
          I've got some Xanax if you want it.
          Like I say, that always works for
          me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         JOEL
          No thanks...

                         DEAN
          Well maybe you should call that
          girl.

                         JOEL
          No, I can't. I can't cheat on
          Suzie. I just gotta power through
          it until I'm so old that I can't
          get it up anymore.

                         DEAN
          What about if Suzie cheated on you?

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I hadn't even thought of
          that...

                         (BEAT)
          I wish she would.

                         DEAN
          You wish she would cheat on you?
          Wouldn't that bother you?
          Joel thinks about it.

                         JOEL
          No. I don't think it would
          actually.
          (occuring to him)
          I guess that's weird huh?

                         DEAN
          Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort
          of.

                         JOEL
          But see, then I could do something
          about all this sexual frustration,
          without feeling guilty about it.

                         DEAN
          Do you think she would cheat on
          you?

                         JOEL
          Nah...

                         DEAN
          You sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JOEL

                         (CONSIDERS IT)
          Well, I don't know. Hmm... Maybe
          if she were really tempted she
          would. Like if some really studly
          guy came on to her.

                         DEAN
          So you're saying she would probably
          cheat on you if she was put in
          temptation's way?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, maybe.

                         DEAN
          You know what you oughtta do?

                         JOEL

                         (WEARY)
          I don't wanna do any drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          No, no. Check this out -- If you
          really wish your wife would cheat
          on you, it's not that hard to make
          it happen.

                         JOEL
          How?

                         DEAN
          Hire a gigolo to have an affair
          with your wife.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. I know a guy.

                         JOEL

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          You know a gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          How do you know a gigolo?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         DEAN
          This guy Brad. He comes in here
          all the time. He's a friend of
          Vic's. You could hire him to have
          an affair with Suzie.

                         JOEL
          Come on Dean.

                         DEAN
          Why not? You said you wouldn't
          care if she cheated on you. Then
          you'd be free to go out with that
          Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out
          -- with no guilt. Problem solved.
          (proud of himself)
          Man, what a great idea.
          Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I will try some of
          that Xanax.
          Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a
          little box and pulls out a pill.

          EXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME

          Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
          Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
          stars, talking.

                         STEP
          I just believe that what's
          right is right.

                         CINDY
          That's right Step, and what's right
          is for you to send a message.

                         STEP
          A message?

                         CINDY
          You need to send a message so that
          a horrible accident like this never
          happens to anyone else ever again.
          That's what's right. And the way
          you do that is to take them to
          court.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         STEP
          You think?

                         CINDY
          Yes Step... That's why I called a
          lawyer for you -- that guy on all
          the bus stop benches.

                         STEP
          Joe Adler?

                         (TOUCHED)
          You did that for me?

                         CINDY
          Mmm hmm... I just want you to do
          what's right Step.
          They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.

                         CINDY
          I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
          you shouldn't get aroused.

                         STEP
          No he didn't.

                         CINDY
          Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
          talked to your doctor. And your
          doctor said it's very important not
          to get aroused until after the
          trial... I'm sorry.

                         STEP
          That's okay... You're so good to me
          Cindy.
          They start cuddling again.

                         CINDY
          Look Step, you're getting me turned
          on, I'm getting you turned on... I
          better just go.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- LATER

          Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol
          combination begins to kick in.
          Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light,
          trying to read the small print. He looks concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         DEAN
          Shit... Do you remember what color
          that pill I gave you was?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         DEAN
          Damn. I don't think it was Xanax.
          I think that might've been
          Ritalin... Or "Special K."

                         JOEL
          (feeling the buzz)
          Ah, who cares?

                         DEAN
          It's just that, ah, Special K is a
          horse tranquilizer, kinda has a
          weird effect when people take it
          but... well, don't worry about
          it... You might not want to drink
          too much more though.

                         JOEL
          (beginning to slur his

                         SPEECH)
          You know that thing you were
          talking about? About the gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          Do you think it would be wrong to
          do that? I mean morally wrong?

                         DEAN
          (with full authority)
          Oh nooo. Definitely not. What
          could be morally wrong about it?

                         JOEL
          I don't know...

                         DEAN
          Look, if she doesn't want to go for
          it, she doesn't have to. And if
          she does, then she's the one who
          sinned, and then it's perfectly
          morally right for you to go out and
          boff whoever you want.

                         (SLURRED SPEECH)
          Yeah, I guess you're right. I
          can't think of anything morally
          wrong about it either.
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          And this guy, he's a friend of
          yours? What's his name?

                         DEAN
          Brad. You want me to give him a
          call?

                         JOEL
          I don't know. It's kinda weird
          even talking about it.

                         DEAN
          Look, this is no big deal Joel.
          I'm serious.

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just
          say you're hiring him to come clean
          the pool or something. See what
          happens. If she doesn't go for it,
          then at least you know you're doing
          the right thing by being faithful.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I guess you're right... I
          don't know. It's crazy.
          Dean pours Joel another drink.

                         DEAN
          Look. Have another drink. Think
          about it... You know what? Why
          don't I just call Brad and see what
          he has to say?

                         JOEL
          Alright. What the hell.
          Joel takes a big swig of liquor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

           INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR - BACK OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Dean and Joel are talking with BRAD, the gigolo. He's young,
           blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead.
          Joel looks really messed up now.

                         JOEL
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         BRAD
          Yeah, two-hundred.

                         DEAN
          Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm
          getting ten percent.

                         JOEL
          What, so you're a pimp now?

                         DEAN

                         (CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE)
          I don't think they're called
          "pimps" when it's with male
          prostitutes, okay. There's some
          other word for it -- it's not a
          "john," but it's something like
          that. Besides, I'm the one who
          hooked all this up. And don't worry
          'cuz it's coming out of Brad's
          money anyway.

                         JOEL
          Alright, alright.

                         (TO BRAD)
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         DEAN
          Two-hundred and twenty.

                         JOEL
          Wait a minute--

                         BRAD
          Um, I have a question?

                         JOEL
          Yeah?
          Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         BRAD
          So like, are you gonna, like, watch
          or something?

                         JOEL
          No no no. God no! It's not like
          that. I won't even be there. I'll
          be at work. Remember? We already
          talked about this.
          Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.

                         JOEL
          What you'll do, is come to my house
          pretending to be the new pool
          cleaner. Then you simply try to
          seduce my wife. Okay? If she
          doesn't respond, you simply clean
          the pool and leave. That's all.
          It's that simple.
          Hold on Brad for a long beat.

                         BRAD
          So, uh, you're not gonna touch my
          ass or anything...?

                         JOEL
          NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
          will not be there. I will be at
          work. You come over to my house
          while I'm not there, posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her...
          Brad finally makes a breakthrough.

                         BRAD
          Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah,
          yeah. I get it now. You're not
          even gonna be there...

                         JOEL
          Yeah, that's right.

                         BRAD
          Yeah... cool. No problem. This is
          gonna be great!

                         JOEL
          Remember, she might not go for it--
          Brad starts to get a little too excited.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can
          hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if
          you know anyone else who needs --
          you know -- what I do, like you
          know, lonely housewives and shit,
          maybe you could tell 'em about me,
          you know...
          Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
          talking.

                         BRAD
          Cuz like, I figure if I did a
          few jobs and I was, like, really
          good? Then maybe they'd tell their
          friends, you know, and they'd give
          me a... what do you call those
          things?

                         DEAN
          Referrals.

                         BRAD
          Yeah yeah, those things. Then
          those women could tell more women
          and then it'd be like I was, like,
          uh... branching or..

                         DEAN
          Networking.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
          if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time. That would be
          awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
          I like getting laid a lot better,
          and my boss is a total dick...

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS' PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

          Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to
          Brad, who still won't shut up.

                         BRAD
          Like I say, if your wife has any
          housewife friends who might--
          Dean finally puts his foot down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         DEAN
          Okay, you've said that a few times
          now Brad. Go on to your car.
          Okay?

                         BRAD
          Alright. Cool. Like I say--

                         DEAN
          Goodnight Brad.

                         BRAD
          Okay. See you later.
          Brad finally leaves.

                         DEAN
          Let me drive you home. You're in
          no condition to drive.
          Joel stumbles into Dean's car.

                         JOEL
          Are you sure about this guy Dean?
          He acts like he's never done this
          before.

                         DEAN
          Oh no. He does it all the time.
          Don't worry. He just gets a little
          excited sometimes. He's cool.

                         JOEL
          I don't know. He sure doesn't seem
          too bright.

                         DEAN
          Yeah well, what do you excpect?
          He's a whore.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - NEXT MORNING

          A break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He
          looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the
          cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then
          drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes
          in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         CINDY
          Looks like you had one of those
          nights.

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Where was I?
          Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of
          his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a
          spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him...

                         JOEL
          Oh shit!
          He runs out of the room.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE

          Joel grabs the phone and dials frantically. Dean answers.

                          JOEL
           Dean?

           DEAN (V.0.)

                         (WAKING UP)
          Oh, hey Joel.

                         JOEL
          Thank God you're home. Ah,... did
          that really happen last night? I
          mean, did we go through with it --
          with that gigolo stuff?

                         DEAN
          Ah, yeah. As far as I know.

                         JOEL
          Shit! What was I thinking?! We
          gotta call it off. Right now. Can
          you call that guy, Brad?

                         DEAN
          Okay...

                         JOEL
          Tell him I'll pay him anyway,
          whatever, just don't come over.
          God, what was I thinking?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         DEAN
          Sure, I'll call him. No problem...
          Oh wait a second. I don't think I
          have his number.

                         JOEL
          What? I thought you called him
          last night.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, but I got his number from
          Vic.

                         JOEL
          Well get it from him again.

                         DEAN
          Vic doesn't have a phone right now.

                         JOEL
          Shit! I'll try information.
          What's Brad's last name?
          Pause.

                         DEAN
          Hmm... it's something like,... I
          think it's a Mexican name.

                         JOEL

                         (LOSING PATIENCE)
          Mexican?! The guy's got blonde
          hair and blue eyes!

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I thought it was weird too --
          a guy like that with a Mexican last
          name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez
          or something.
          Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door.

          INT. RECEPTIONIST DESK IN FRONT OF JOEL'S OFFICE --


                         CONTINUOUS ACTION
          Brian walks in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         BRIAN

                         (CONCERNED)
          Joel, we gotta talk.

                         JOEL
          Not now Brian.

                         BRIAN
          Ah yeah, it's kind of important --
          kind of really important. It's

                         ABOUT STEP-
          Joel rushes past him.

                         JOEL
          Not now!
          We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his SECRETARY.

                         SECRETARY
          Excuse me Joel? There's a Brad
          Chavez on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          I can't, I--
          Joel stops suddenly.

                         JOEL
          Who?

                         SECRETARY
          Brad Chavez. He said he's done
          with the job you guys talked about
          at your house? Do you want me to
          take a message?
          Joel looks pale.

                          JOEL
           Um, no... He's the ah, pool
           cleaner. I better take that.
          Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up.

                         JOEL
          Hello?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, is this Joel?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, it's Brad. Mission
          accomplished dude.

                         JOEL
          What do you mean?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I mean it worked. She totally went
          for it.

                         JOEL
          What? What're you...?
          (looks at his watch)
          You weren't even supposed to be
          there for another 45 minutes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh really? I forgot what time you
          guys said, and I was so excited
          about it, I just went over there.
          Joel sits down, freaked out.

                         JOEL
          (reality setting in)
          So you mean she actually ah... you
          guys...?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Yup. It was easy.

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Easy? What do you mean "easy"?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, I don't mean easy like she was
          easy -- like she was a slut or
          anything. I just mean it wasn't
          hard to get her to... Never mind.

                         JOEL
          No. Tell me. Tell me how it
          happened.

                         (BRACES HIMSELF)
          I wanna hear everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         BRAD
          You sure?

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay. Well, she let me in, so I
          went back like I was cleaning the
          pool...

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.

           BRAD (V.0.)
           .I don't know anything about pool
           cleaning, so I was just faking it.
           She was in her bathing suit...
          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.

           BRAD (V.0.)
          .So I struck up a conversation...

                         BRAD
          This is a really nice house.

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.

                         BRAD
          Is it your Dad's house?

                         SUZIE
          No. It's ours.

                         BRAD
          Wow, you look so young to be living
          in a house this nice.

                         SUZIE
          Oh, thanks.
          Beat.

                         BRAD
          Do you have any sunscreen? I
          forgot mine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Brad's dopey narration comes back in...

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I thought that was pretty smart
          of me -- to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
          once she gave me some, I could ask
          her if she wanted some too, and rub
          some on her back, instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
          down on the chair.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her, the rest was easy...
          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.

                         JOEL
          Okay that's enough! Stop!

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


                         JOEL
          I don't need to hear anymore.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay, cool. Hey, like I say, if
          you know of anyone else, or if you
          ever need me to do it again--

                         JOEL
          NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.
          Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a
          state of shock.

                         JOEL
          (quietly, to himself)
          Holy shit.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home from work. He still looks freaked out. He
          notices something ahead, and suddenly SLAMS ON THE BREAKS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         JOEL
          Dammit !
          JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front
          yard, puttering around with the mail.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No... not today...
           Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked
           car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
           crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
          driveway.

                         NATHAN
          How's it goin'?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
          just wanted to let you know, I got
          those tickets to that dinner we
          talked about on the 7th. I think I
          told you they were forty dollars a
          piece, but it turns out it's a tad
          more this year -- fifty-five -- so
          if I could go ahead and just get a
          check from you guys...

                         JOEL
          Look, ah, we can't go. Remember?

                         NATHAN
          No, this is the 7th. You said
          you're going out of town on the
          17th.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but remember, I told you we
          didn't really want to go to this
          thing.
          Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.

                         NATHAN
          But I already bought the tickets.
          I know you said something about her
          feeling uncomfortable, but, like I
          say, she won't feel uncomfortable
          at all -- I guarantee it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         47

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          It's just a whole lot of fun. You
          guys'll have a great time.

                         JOEL
          Look, I gotta get going.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then...
          Joel starts to pull away.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Oh, one more thing --
          Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel and Suzie are eating dinner. Suzie has a glow about
          her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc.
          Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor. They eat in
          silence for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          So... How's work?

                         JOEL
          It sucks.

                         SUZIE
          Really? What's wrong?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.
          Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence
          for a beat.

                         JOEL
          I don't feel well. I'm going to
          bed.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          From the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working
          down on the production floor. Cindy looks up, they make eye
          contact for a brief moment. She gives him a flirtacious wave.
          Joel waves back. Then Rory comes by, starts talking to
          Cindy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINOUS


                         CINDY
          So you're in a band?

                         RORY
          .Actually, I'm in five bands
          right now. But Godscock is
          basically the same four guys as
          Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of
          a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock
          is more melodic stuff.
          Cindy nods politely. Rory thinks she's interested.

                         RORY (CONT'D)
          So you comin' Friday?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely.
          (looks at her watch)
          Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist
          appointment.

                         RORY
          Cool.
          Cindy leaves.
          ANGLE ON Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them.
          She talks to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          See, there he goes again, slowing
          us down.

                         (RE: CINDY)
          Now she's a good sorter. They need
          to hire more people like her.

                         GABRIELLA
          She's so nice too.
          Hector walks by. Mary just shakes her head.

                         MARY
          I can't believe he's still working
          here. You know Silvia can't find
          her wallet. Thinks it was stolen.
          And guess who was in the locker
          room last? Hector.
          They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         MARY
          You know, I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines. My Niece works
          there. I'd get better benefits
          than we get here too.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Gemco. You think they would put up
          with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn.
          They run a tight ship.

                         MARY
          That's right.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel's POV of Mary and Gabrielle, yacking self-righteously.
          Joel looks on with disgust...

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Good riddance...
          Brian steps in, taps on the door.

                         BRIAN
          You got a second? I think we might
          have a big problem here. I'm not
          sure what happened, but all of the
          sudden Step says he doesn't want to
          settle anymore. I think he
          might've talked to a lawyer.
          Joel goes to his desk, sits down.

                         BRIAN
          Like I say, General Mills isn't
          going to make their offer official
          until this settles.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          I think Step is just chest-beating.
          He does this all the time. He gets
          all wound up, talks big, then he
          always backs down. And that's with
          his balls.

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          It's a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles. We PAN
          past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with
          their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
          junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
          each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
          chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
          past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,
          ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a PAROLE OFFICER is
          giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          I'm sorry to even bring this up,
          but you're not living with the drug
          dealer anymore are you?
          Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50
          with bushy grey hair and a mustache, he has a badge and a gun
          on his belt.

                         CINDY
          Nope. I'm staying at Extended Stay
          until I can find a place...
          She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card.

                         CINDY (CONT'D)
          See?

                         (SINCERE)
          I really feel like I've turned my
          life around. Thanks in large part
          to you.

                         PAROLE OFFICER

                         (ALMOST BLUSHING)
          It's okay. I'm just glad to see
          you're doing so well... Ah, one
          more thing I just need to ask you:
          We had a little incident up in
          Templeton a couple weeks back where
          someone stole an expensive guitar
          from a music store? Someone who
          fit your description. You know
          anything about that?

                         CINDY
          Huh? No... I was probably at work
          that day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Look Cindy, you realize you can't
          screw up anymore right? I mean,
          even something minor, and you could
          go back to jail for a while this
          time. I'd hate to see that happen.

                         CINDY
          Well yeah, but why would I steal a
          guitar? I've got no musical
          talent. I'm tone deaf.
          They both laugh.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Heh heh, So am I. I can't carry a
          tune to save my life.

                         CINDY
          Really? Wow...
          Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical
          talent. He happily goes on about it, forgetting about the
          guitar...

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Yeah, I could barely sing the Star
          Spangled Banner in school...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

          It's the end of the workday. People walk to their cars.
          Joel turns a corner and finds Cindy right in front of him.

                         CINDY
          Hey Mr. Reynolds.

                         JOEL
          Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call
          me Joel.

                         CINDY

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Okay Joel. So you going to the
          party tonight?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight...

                         (AWKWARD)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

          JOEL (CON T - D )
          Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are
          you going?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely. Maybe I'll see
          you there?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I think I'll probably go.

                         CINDY
          Do you have the directions?

                         JOEL
          I'm not sure...

                         CINDY
          Here, I'll write it down just in

                         CASE
          Cindy opens her purse. We see at least FIVE WALLETS, SEVERAL
          WATCHES, JEWELRY, etc. She takes out a pen and a piece of
          pink, girly stationary and starts writing.

                         CINDY (CONT'D)
          I'll also put my number on here.
          In case you want to call me some
          time -- if you want.
          Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid.

                         JOEL
          Um... Okay. Sure.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he
          practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down.
          Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls
          down the window.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there. Almost missed ya.

                         JOEL
          Hi. I can't talk right now--

                         NATHAN
          Hey, I noticed you guys got a new
          pool cleaner today. How is he?
          We're thinking of changing
          services.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         JOEL
          Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you
          mean yesterday, don't you?

                         NATHAN
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          The new pool cleaner. You saw him
          yesterday right? Not today.

                         NATHAN
          No. It was today. The new guy.

                         JOEL
          What'd he look like?

                         NATHAN
          Blonde haired kid, about this high,
          good looking. Real good looking.

                         IN FACT--

                         JOEL
          You sure it was today? Not
          yesterday?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          You're absolutely sure?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. I know it was today, because
          I came home for lunch. I was gone
          all day yesterday. Anyway, you
          think I could go ahead and get that
           check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
           dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
           total. There's no tax...
          Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
           opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.
          He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing at my
          house today?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, umm... nothing.

                         JOEL
          Bullshit!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I
          won't charge you for this one.

                         JOEL
          Won't charge me for...? You had
          sex with my wife again?!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Well, I figured we already did it
          once, so what's the big deal? I
          mean, she said to stop by if I was
          in the neighborhood, so... Besides,
          I'm not gonna charge you--

                         JOEL
          Not gonna charge...? God damn you!
          Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm
          gonna pay you! You're not having
          sex with my wife for free! And I
          better not ever catch you anywhere
          near my house ever again!
          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
          picks it back up and hits the "End" button.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
          through, mumbles something about going to a party.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
          stays in the car, checking it out.
          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.
          It's downright pathetic.
          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.

                         JOEL
          I can't believe my wife slept with
          that guy.

                         DEAN
          Well... I thought you said it
          wouldn't bother you.

                         JOEL
          I guess I didn't really think about
          it long enough... I just wish it
          hadn't been so easy for him.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really
          go wild for that Brad...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          No, you're right. He may be a
          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he
          can get any girl he wants. Me, I
          had to work for it. I had to work
          hard, get a career going, take
          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry
          her. But not Brad. He gets to
          waltz into my house and have sex
          with my wife just like that. Oh,
          and by the way? That little prick
          was at my house again today.

                         DEAN
          No shit? What was he doing?

                         JOEL
          Take a wild guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         DEAN
          Wow... You pay a guy to do a job,
          then he comes back and does it for
          free.

                         JOEL
          I'm not going to let him do it for
          free. No way. I'm paying him.

                         DEAN
          Really? How much?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. The same, I
          guess. Why?

                         DEAN
          Hmm... So should I get my twenty
          dollars from Brad then or...
          Joel shoots Dean an angry look.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          We can worry about that later...
          Look at the bright side, now you
          can call Cindy.

                         JOEL
          I don't know... I feel weird about
          it. Besides, she's at the party,
          she probably won't be home 'til
          late.

                         DEAN
          You know what you need to do?

                         JOEL
          (rolling his eyes)
          I don't wanna do drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          Look, I know I joke around a lot,
          but this time I'm serious.
          (like a doctor)
          You should try smoking a little
          pot. It's just an herb, it heals.
          Stress can kill you, and--

                         JOEL
          I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         DEAN
          Not when you just smoke a little.
          Come on. You ever meet my friend
          Willie? Great guy. Really great
          guy.
          (as if it's a positive)
          He's the guy I got that horse
          tranquilizer from.

                         JOEL
          Oh, wonderful.

          INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
          inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player
          type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
          two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean
          pontificates.

                         DEAN
          I've been reading about it --
          they're making technological
          advances now, coming up with great
          drugs that can make you happy and
          won't leave you with a hangover or
          nothin'.

                         WILLIE
          (holding in bong-hit)
          Right on.
          Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
          than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
          out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
          bong and lighter to Joel.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
          light weight. I think that's too
          much for me--

                         WILLIE
          (still holding out the
          bong and lighter)
          Bullshit.

                         DEAN
          Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
          stuff isn't that strong.
          (to Willie, re: Joel)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          DEAN (CON T-D)
          He gets paranoid when he gets too
          stoned.
          Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
          partly out of being intimidated by Willie.

                         JOEL
          Ah, what the hell.
          Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
          Have you ever used one before?

                         JOEL
          Umm, I think... no.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, pay attention. Put your
          thumb right here on the carburetor.
          When I pull the plunger up and say,
          "let go" I want you to let go and
          inhale hard.
          Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
          with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay exhale!

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I should just let

                         YOU GUYS--

                         WILLIE
          (starting to get scary)
          Bullshit! EXHALE HARD!
          Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
          Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
          pushes it down.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Let go! Inhale! NOW!
          Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)

                         (INSANE)

          GO! GO! HARDER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Joel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts
          of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger.

                         STONER-RIPPLE

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked --
          especially Joel. (We play most of the scene from Joel's
          stoned, paranoid POV.)
          Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he?

                         JOEL
          What?
          Long pause.

                         DEAN
          Huh?
          Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
          with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.

                         WILLIE
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I thought somebody said
          something.
          Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
          Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
          in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.

                         WILLIE

          BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
          Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his
          ass off.

                         WILLIE
          Haaaah ha... The look on your face!

                         (INSANE CACKLE)
          Man you really do get paranoid when
          you get stoned.

                         JOEL
          (fake, timid laugh)
          Yeah, heh heh...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         DEAN
          Hey Joel, why don't you call that
          chick now?

                         JOEL
          What time is it?

                         WILLIE
          Time for you to call her and
          finally get laid man!
          (handing him the phone)
          Come on!

                         DEAN
          It's twelve thirty. She might be
          back by now.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.

                         WILLIE
          So what's this chick look like?

                         JOEL
          Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty
          hot. Kind of working-class
          looking...

                         WILLIE
          What do you mean by that?
           Willie stares at Joel for a beat. Joel can't tell if he's
          offended Willie or not.

                         JOEL
          Umm... Oh you know,...

                         WILLIE
          Is she kind of slutty lookin'?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either.

                         WILLIE
          Alright! That's how I like 'em.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH)
          Kinda nasty, heh heh...
          Joel starts dialing the number.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          I hope I don't wake her up...

                         (LISTENS)
          It's busy.

                         DEAN
          Alright. At least you know she's
          home.

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

                         WILLIE
          Try her again. Come on.
          Joel hits redial.

                         JOEL
          Still busy... Man, what kind of
          person doesn't have call-waiting.

                         WILLIE
          I don't have call-waiting. I hate
          call-waiting. Every time I hear
          that goddamn clicking sound, I
          wanna put my fist through someone's
          head.
          Beat. Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind
          his watch. Willie stares at him, then

                         WILLIE
          Haaa ha! Man you really do get
          paranoid when you're stoned...
          Seriously though, I fuckin' hate
          call-waiting.

                         JOEL

                         (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
          Yeah...
          Willie grabs the phone.

                         WILLIE
          Here let me dial. You're too
          stoned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number. He
          looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
          something.
          Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
          hangs up the phone.

                         WILLIE
          I'll tell you why you're getting a
          busy signal. This is my number.

                         JOEL
          Huh? But...
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Oh... You're joking right? Trying
          to make me paranoid?
          Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
          just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
          UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
          CINDY enters.

                         CINDY
          Hi. Sorry I'm late, I...

                         (NOTICING JOEL)
          Joel? What are you doing here...?
          Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
          suddenly stands up.

                         DEAN
          Well, it looks like you guys got a
          lot to talk about here so I think
          I'm just gonna go ahead and take
          off. Later guys.
          Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
          leave, but Willie blocks him.

                         WILLIE
          Kinda slutty?
          Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
          tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
          punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Joel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue
           from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
           As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
           on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
          Joel.

                         SUZIE
          Oh my God Joel, are you alright?
          What happened?

                         JOEL
          I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah...
          got my ass kicked. Go back to
          sleep.

                         SUZIE
          What? By who? What happened?

                         JOEL
          It was just... some guy over at
          Scoreboards.

                         SUZIE
          Let me drive you to the hospital.
          You need to get checked out.

                         JOEL
          No. I'll be fine. I just want to
          sleep right now, okay?

                         SUZIE
          You sure you're okay? It looks
          like your nose is broken, and your

                         EYE--

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Don't worry about it! People get
          their asses kicked all the time!
          It's no big deal. Go back to
          sleep.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - MORNING

          Joel walks past his Secretary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SECRETARY
          Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you--

                         (NOTICING)
          Oh my God, what happened?
          Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some
          stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Joel walks over to the window overlooking the production
          area. He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back
          turned. Shakes his head.
          Brian KNOCKS on the door and enters, looking worried.

                         BRIAN
          Hi... Did you talk to Step yet?

                         JOEL
          He isn't returning my calls.

                         BRIAN
          Shit... We've got problems. He did
          hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's
          that personal injury lawyer you see
          on all the bus-stop benches. You
          oughtta see this guy. He's a real
          piece of shi--
          (noticing Joel's face)
          Oh man, what happened to you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I fell down some stairs.

                         BRIAN
          Damn... Well anyway, I hate to say
          this, but I think we're screwed.
          There's no way this Adler guy is
          gonna settle for anything less then
          bankrupting us. Says he'll sue us
          into the stone age.

                         JOEL
          (clutches his head

                         MISERABLE)
          Shit... I gotta talk to Step.
          Brian looks at Joel's bruised face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         BRIAN
          Man, everyone's getting hurt.
          Cindy came in with a black eye
          today. You hear how she got it?

                         JOEL
          Ah... no.

                         BRIAN
          Step did it. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          No he--!

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          What? Where did you hear that?

                         BRIAN
          That's what she told Mary.

                         JOEL
          But... Step? Does he even know
          her?

                         BRIAN
          Apparently they've been going out.

                         JOEL
          What?!

                         BRIAN
          I know, it's weird. They didn't
          even meet here. They met at a
          grocery store or something. Just a
          total coincidence.
          Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind
          reeling.

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a
          couple of new people because

                         CINDY'S QUITTING--

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         BRIAN
          Yep. And if it's okay with you,
          I'd like to go ahead and fire
          Hector.

                         JOEL
          Fire Hector? What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         BRIAN
          You know, Mary's purse? Sylvia's
          wallet? It's gotta be him. Who
          else could it be?
          Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion.

                         JOEL
          No. Don't fire him. Just trust me
          on this. Give him another week.
          If anything else is stolen, then
          you can fire him.

                         BRIAN

                         (PUZZLED)
          Alright. If you say so.
          Brian looks Joel over.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          Man, are you okay? Have you seen a
          doctor?
          Joel's Secretary BEEPS in.

          SECRATARY (V.0.)
          Joel, Dean is on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          Okay, thanks.

                         (TO BRIAN)
          I better get this.
          Brian leaves.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Hello.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you
          like that last night. It's just
          that I don't like to get involved
          in other people's personal shit,
          you know what I mean?

                         JOEL
          Uh-huh.

                         DEAN
          I didn't even know Willie had a
          girlfriend. She must be new. Man,
          Willie looked pissed.

                         (CHUCKLES)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          DEAN (CON T'D)
          I thought he was gonna take a swing
          at you there for a second.

                         JOEL
          He did take a swing at me Dean.
          Several swings. In fact, he beat
          the living shit out of me.

                         DEAN
          Whoa, really?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

                         DEAN
          Wow. Man, that really goes to show
          you -- this town is smaller than
          you think. You really gotta be
          careful.
          Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his
          Secretary.

                         JOEL
          I'm not feeling well. I'm going to
          go home early.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY

          Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as
          he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck
          down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out
          of their vehicles. Joel is livid.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing on my
          street again?!

                         BRAD
          Dude, you weren't supposed to be
          home for another four hours--
          Whoa, what happened to your face?

                         JOEL
          (trying to improvise a
          tough, snappy comeback,
          but can't quite make it

                         WORK)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          The same thing that's gonna
          happen.. Your face is gonna look
          worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever
          catch you anywhere near my house or
          my wife again, I'll have you
          arrested.

                         BRAD
          For what? Suzie let me in.
          Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point.

                         JOEL
          What the hell is wrong with you
          anyway? Do you do this with all
          your clients -- just keep coming
          back and hanging around?

                         BRAD
          I don't know. This is my first
          one.

                         JOEL
          What?! I thought you were a
          professional!

                         BRAD
          Look man, I know she's your wife
          an' shit, but you might as well
          know -- I think we're in love.

                         JOEL
          In love?!

                         (COMING UNGLUED)
          HA! Man are you stupid. You are
          so goddamn dumb. You think she
          loves you? You're nothing but a
          piece of ass to her. That's all.

                         BRAD
          I don't think so dude.

                         JOEL
          Oh, you don't think so "dude?"
          Well did you ever think about this:
          she doesn't even know that I paid
          you to have sex with her -- did
          that cross your small mind?

                         BRAD
          Uuh..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOEL
          How about I go home right now and
          tell her? Tell her you did it for
          the money. How about that loverboy?
          Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.

                         BRAD
          You wouldn't do that.

                         JOEL
          You don't think so? Watch me.

                         BRAD
          (realizing he's serious)
           No... Dude, please don't. Please?
          Joel starts back to his car.

                         BRAD
          Look man, we really have a special
          thing going on. Please don't mess
          it up...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          Don't mess it up?! You're talking
          about my wife! My house! Stupid-
          ass!
          Joel gets in his car and starts it.

                         BRAD
          (calls out to him)
          Dude, you can't do this to me.

                         JOEL
          Oh yes I can...
          Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his
          driveway.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Joel walks in, still pissed off. Suzie is sitting on the
          couch, a little surprised to see him.

                         SUZIE
          Oh hi. You're home early.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JOEL

                         (COLD)
          Hi.
          Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
          the pool. It's filthy.

                         JOEL
          So how was that new pool cleaner?
           Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
          she plays it cool.

                         SUZIE
          Um... What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          What do you think I mean?... Did
          he do a good job cleaning the pool?

                         SUZIE
          Ah... well--

                         JOEL
          Did he get all the... leaves? It
          doesn't really look that clean. I
          mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
          it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
          guy even clean it at all? It sure
          doesn't look like it.

                         SUZIE

                         (NERVOUS)
          Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a
          very good job.

                         JOEL
          I think he did a horrible job. I
          don't think we should use him
          anymore.

                         SUZIE
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          Okay.
          Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.

                         SUZIE
          Are you all right, Joel? You want
          an aspirin or anything?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JOEL
          No.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Quick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his
          head, can't believe all this.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE -- NEXT DAY

           In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He
           walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to
          him and then invite him in.

          INT. STEP'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

          Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a
          ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of
          Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The
          TV is deafeningly loud.

                         STEP
          Wow, I don't think you've ever been
          to my house before. Have you?

                         JOEL
          (talking above the TV)
          Yeah, I don't think so. I would've
          remembered...

                         STEP
          This is my half brother Phil.
          Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's
          not happening anyway. Phil nods.

                         JOEL
          Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in
          another room.

                         STEP
          Sure, let's go out back.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- A LITTLE LATER

          Joel and Step sit at a picnic table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         STEP
          You know, my lawyer told me not to
          talk to you.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not here to try to talk me
          out of suing are you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of
          curious about... ah... So you've
          been going out with Cindy, huh?

                         STEP
          Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
          might even get married after all
          this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
          worked out.

                         JOEL
          .so some of the guys at work are
          saying you gave Cindy that black
          eye.

                         STEP
          What? That ain't true at all.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know it's not.

                         STEP
          She got it from falling down some
          stairs.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... Look, you might wanna be
          careful with Cindy.

                         STEP

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          Well, I'm not sure how to put this,
          but... You know, you got a lot of
          money coming your way with this
          settlement. You might wanna be

                         CAREFUL--

                         STEP
          Oh no. No, she didn't even know
          about that 'til after we started
          going out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about
          it for a while 'cuz I was kind of
          embarrassed, you know? You don't
          tell a girl you just met that you
          lost one of your balls. Especially
          a girl as hot as Cindy.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (DELICATELY)
          You know she lives with this guy
          Willie right?

                         STEP
          That's her ex. She broke up with
          him. She's gonna move out. She
          just needs to get all her stuff
          outta there.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.

                         JOEL
          Oh. Hmm...

                         STEP
          Look, I know Cindy's got some
          problems, but she means well.
          She's the best thing that ever
          happened to me.

                         JOEL
          Well, okay... If you say so.
          Another thing -- you just might
          want to watch your back. Some of
          the guys at work who think you gave
          Cindy the black eye were talking
          about paying you a visit -- you
          know, getting even.

                         STEP
          Oh. Well I'm not worried about
          that.
          (dead-serious, proud)
          I could kick anyone's ass at that
          whole company.

           Brad and Suzie are by the pool which is filthy. Brad starts
          coming on to Suzie. She pushes him away.

                         SUZIE
          No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but
          we have to stop doing this.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          It's not right. I feel horrible.
          Besides, I think Joel's getting
          suspicious. And you gotta start
          cleaning the pool too.

                         BRAD
          But I've never felt this way about
          anyone before. And I've been with
          a lot of chicks.

                         SUZIE

                         (TURNED OFF)
          Uh-huh... Look Brad, the truth is
          I love my husband. I really do.
          This was all a big mistake. I'm
          sorry. I don't know what got into
          me, but we have to stop this. I
          want to make my marriage work
          again. I'm going to tell Joel
          about the whole thing and just hope
          he forgives me. And even if he
          doesn't, at least I won't be
          carrying around this horrible
          feeling. I just can't stand that
          he doesn't know.

                         BRAD
          Uh... This doesn't mean we can't
          still see each other though, right?

                         SUZIE
          Ah, yes it does.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          Because of all the things I just
          said.

                         (MORE)

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (PATIENTLY)
          Do you need me to say them again?

                         BRAD
          Can I see you tomorrow?

                         SUZIE
          No.

                         BRAD

                         (PLEADING)
          How about next week?

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel
          could be home any second.

                         BRAD
          I'll call you tomorrow.

                         SUZIE
          (just trying to get rid of

                         HIM)
          Okay. Okay, just go and we'll talk
          later.
          Brad leans to kiss her, she pushed him away and he finally
          leaves.

                         SUZIE

                         (TO HERSELF)
          God, what a moron.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel sits deep in his chair, bummed out, staring down at the
          manufacturing area. Brian walks in.

                         BRIAN
          So... you ready?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         BRIAN
          The meeting with Step's lawyer. Or
          lawyers I should say. It's today
          remember?

                         JOEL
          Oh shit... Alright.
          Joel drags himself out of the chair.

          JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
          paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
          is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
          chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
          with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)

                         ADLER
          .You see, if both his balls had
          been knocked clean off, he would be
          a good case, but not a great case:
          A man with no balls is no man at
          all. He's a freak. He's barely
          human. He's gross. And a jury will
          never feel like they can walk in
          the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
          he/she freak. But Step. He's
          still got one ball - barely. He's
          still a man. A man who's very
          manhood has been jeopardized, but
          still a man. And that manhood,
          that very sense of what you are as
          a human being is hanging by a
          thread. Jesus, you can't get more
          dramatic than that. That brave
          ball, hanging on for dear life,
          hanging on for justice, is going to
          be the hero of this trial. I'm
          tellin' ya this Step guy is the
          fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
          Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
          when I bought those bus bench ads.
          But I knew the asses of those poor
          slobs that sit on those benches and
          ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
          cars are our future. And I --
          Joel and Brian walk in.

                         ADLER
          Oh, hello. I'm Joe Adler...

          A bunch of employees including Mary, Garielle, and Rory are

          And we're the ones doing all the
          work.

                         GABRIELLE
          That's right.

                         RORY
          It's bullshit man. We should get a
          piece of it. I work my ass off.

                         MARY
          Gabrielle and I work harder than
          anybody. I should be making what
          Brian makes. If you add up all the
          crates I move, I lift 10,000 pounds
          a day. Minimum.

                         GABRIELLE
          That's right. Here he's gonna make
          a million dollars, and we're the
          ones who do everything. I went to
          college. For three years.

                         MARY
          If we quit, this place couldn't
          run. They wouldn't be able to sell
          this place for anything.
          JIM, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big
          mustache and a little paunch, chimes in.

                         JIM
          That's why what we should do is, is
          we should all go on strike --
          demand stock in the company before
          it sells. If General Mills knew
          we were on strike, they wouldn't
          buy this place until the strike was
          over. That way they'd have to give
          us stock.
          Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod.
          It starts to build steam.

                         RORY
          That's right man. We should do it.
          We should strike.

                         MARY
          That's right. I could get a job at
          Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
          employees are owners -- even says
          so on the name tags.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines...

          The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
          table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
          Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
          one lawyer who doesn't say much.
          Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
          The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
          window facing the manufacturing area.

                         ADLER
          Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
          everything and the only way we
          would even begin to consider a
          settlement would be to the tune of
          the number you see on the bottom of
          page 18. Does everyone have this?
           Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
          the number.

                         JOEL
          What!!!?
          (so pissed he can barely
          get the words out)
          We don't have this much money! Not
          even close!

                         ADLER
          Not in cash you don't. Of course
          not. But if you were to sell off
          your assets: the property lease,
          the equipment, the--

                         JOEL
          What the ff-- Are you shitting
          me!? That would bankrupt us!

                         BRIAN
          This is what I've been trying to
          tell you Joel...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         JOEL
          If you think I'm just going to give
          up this entire company that I built
          from the ground up--
          Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.

                         ADLER
          How about what my client gave up!?
          His testicles! How about that!?
          He walks over to the door...

                         ADLER
          In fact, I'll make a deal with you -
          - we will drop this case right now
          if you come over here and put your
          testicles right here
          (indicates the space
          between the door and the

                         HINGES)
          and let me slam this door like
          this...
          Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard.

                         ADLER
          Go ahead. We can settle this right
          now -- call it even. I will drop
          this case right now if you let me
          slam your balls in this door,

          BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY

          CLIENT!

                         JOEL
          It was an accident!

                         ADLER
          Not according to our investigation.
          We believe that, in fact, there was
          gross negligence...

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling
          around, talking, the idea of the strike gaining momentum.
          Rory points up to the confrence room.

                         RORY
          I heard those guys up there are the
          guys from General Mills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Employees' POV: Adler pacing around, yelling, Joel yelling
          back, etc. [They can't hear any of it.]

                         MARY
          Mmm hmm...

                         JIM
          See, now they're probably up there
          negotiating right now -- cuttin' up
          the pie that we baked. That's what
          it looks like to me.
          The employees all nod in agreement.
          Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
          door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.

                         RORY
          We gotta act fast. They could be
          about to close the deal.

                         JIM
          Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.

                         RORY
          Yeah, then it's too late. If
          they've already sold it we can't
          get a piece of it. We gotta act
          fast. We need to do one of those
          walk outs.

                         JIM
          Well, we better do it now.

                         RORY
          Okay, who's in? We need a show of
          force. Come on, it's now or
          never...
          We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum,
          ending on HECTOR, who looks completely confused by it all.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The meeting heats up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         ADLER
          Okay then, let me go back to my
          previous offer: I will gladly come
          down on that price -- I'll come all
          the way down to zero and drop this
          case -- if you go over there right
          now and slam your testicles in that
          door! Because--

                         JOEL
          I don't wanna slam my testicles in
          the door! I want you to be
          reasonable! You won't even budge
          one penny! Come on!

                         ADLER
          Like I say, if you slam your--

                         JOEL
          I'll slam your balls in the door!

                         ADLER
          I'm sorry, did you just threaten
          me?
          Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.

                         BRIAN
          Look, we need to cool off a minute.
          We'll be right back.
          Brian leads Joel out of the room.

          HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         JOEL
          I don't need this. I'm going home.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          Joel walks down the stairs. The group of employees see him
          and ready themselves for the big confrontation. Joel notices
          them all looking at him and stops.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... What?
          But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
          first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
          and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         RORY
          Umm... We were just uh...

                         JIM
          Well, Rory was talking about how
          you guys are doing this deal with
          General Mills and we just think
          that ah... We were considering the
          idea of ah...

                         RORY
          Well, we just think that we should
          maybe get a piece of it, you know
          cuz we do all the work... And if we
          don't... um...
          Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.

                         JOEL
          You know what? Fine. Fine.
          You're all in charge -- all of you.
          (gestures to all the

                         EMPLOYEES)
          As of now. You run the goddamn
          place. Go ahead. In fact, you can
          go up there right now and meet with
          Adler. He may slam your balls in
          the door, but woohoo! You're the
          boss!
          Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
          A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
          talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
          etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
          didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
          were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
          As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to
          their posts, muttering.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Joel is sitting at the table, picking at some food, looking
          miserable. Suzie comes over, gathers up her nerve.

                         SUZIE
          Listen Joel, there's something I
          have to tell you. I think we need
          to be honest with each other.
          Suzie sits down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          I'm not sure how to say this, but --
          well, you've been so caught up in
          you're work lately, and I'm here
          alone all day and sometimes I just--

                         JOEL
          You banged the pool cleaner.

                         SUZIE
          Wha...
          Suzie is stunned.

                         JOEL
          That's what you're trying to tell
          me right? You had sex with Brad?

                         SUZIE
          You knew?

                         JOEL
          Yes I knew. I hired him.

                         SUZIE
          Well I know you hired him, but how
          did you know about--

                         JOEL
          I don't mean I hired him to clean
          the pool, I mean I hired him to
          have sex with you.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         JOEL
          He's a gigolo Suzie.
          Suzie is stupefied.

                         SUZIE
          But... what... Why?
          Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything.

                         JOEL
          I hired him to have an affair with
          you so that I could have an affair
          without feeling guilty. I was
          really drunk and on some kind of
          horse tranquilizer and--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         SUZIE
          Brad was getting paid?...
          (disbelief, hurt)
          So you've been paying Brad this
          whole time? All fifteen times?!

                         JOEL
          FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ
          Suzie!
          Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I only paid him once -- well,
          twice. The rest was on the house.
          Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.

                         SUZIE
          You wanted to have an affair with
          another woman?

                         JOEL
          Yes. But I didn't.
          Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all
          this. Then, decisively,

                         SUZIE
          You asshole.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm the asshole?

                         SUZIE
          Yes! How could you?

                         JOEL

                         (LAUGHS)
          How could I? How could you?!!!
          You didn't have to have sex with
          him. You could've simply said "No
          thanks. Just clean the pool," but
          you didn't, did you?! No, you took
          him up on his little offer and had
          sex with him -- fifteen times!

                         SUZIE
          None of this would've happened if
          you hadn't hired him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JOEL
          Okay. I'll admit, I made a big
          mistake. I was drunk, on drugs,
          stressed, sexually frustrated and I
          shouldn't have hired a male
          prostitute to seduce you. But if
          you had simply been faithful, none
          of this would've happened.
          Suzie just looks at him for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          You're sick, you know that?
          Beat. Joel can't really argue this point.

                         JOEL
          What do you see in Brad anyway?
          He's borderline retarded. You
          probably could've been arrested for
          having sex with a guy that dumb.

                         SUZIE
          That's it. I'm leaving.
          Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her.

                         JOEL
          No. You're not leaving me. I'm
          leaving you!

                         SUZIE
          Fine.
          Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find
          NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya.
          You guys hardly ever answer the
          door. Heh heh.
          They are both so flustered, they can barely talk.

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time Nathan.
          Joel turns around, storms off back into the house.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, you guys goin' somewhere?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, we can't talk right now.

                         NATHAN
          Well, you think I could go ahead
          and get that check from ya then?
          I'm just trying to balance my
          checkbook here...

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time.

                         NATHAN
          When would be a good time, you
          think?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know.

                         NATHAN
          See the thing is--

                         SUZIE
          Okay tomorrow.

                         NATHAN
          Great, what time?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know. Just come by
          tomorrow. I can't talk now.

                         NATHAN
          Okay great. And if you could just
          go ahead and have that check,
          that'd be great. It's a hundred
          and ten. That's two plates at

                         FIFTY-FIVE--

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, Okay...
          Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off.

           EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- DAY

           Joel checks into an Extended Stay America hotel.(a chain of
          hotels that rent by the week.)
          Quick shot of Joel sitting alone in the room. He drops his
          suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed, grabs the remote.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          He turns on Spectravision and surfs the Adult titles, decides
          he's not into it and switches back to regular TV only to find
          American Idol is on. He stares at it for a beat, then flops
          down on the bed and stares at the ceiling.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows. Dean is over by
          the cash register, tending to some business. Brad enters,
          walks over to Joel. Joel looks the other way.

                         BRAD
          Hey man... I know you probably
          want to kick my ass, but--

                         JOEL
          I couldn't kick your ass if I
          wanted to. You're a good 10 years
          younger than me, and I'm a pussy.
          So why don't you just leave me
          alone.

                         BRAD
          I just wanted to tell you, I'm not
          gonna see Suzie anymore. You don't
          have to worry.
          Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead.

                         BRAD
          The last time I was over there, she
          broke it off; told me to quit
          coming over... She said she was
          gonna tell you everything -- you
          know, about us. She's really into
          you dude. I guess that's why she
          married you an' shit... You're a
          lucky guy... Sorry if I messed shit
          up.
          Beat. Joel takes another swig.

                         JOEL
          Why'd you have to get hung up on
          Suzie? You could have any girl you
          want.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but I want Suzie. And I
          can't have her.

                         JOEL
          You had her fifteen times.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but she doesn't love me dude.
          It's just not the same... Anyway,
          just wanted to tell you that.

                         JOEL
          Well... You told me.

                         BRAD
          Alright, later...
          Brad starts to leave. Then he stops, turns around.

                         BRAD
          Oh, one more thing... I quit my
          landscaping job... And I don't
          think I'm really cut out to be a
          gigolo. So I was wondering if you
          had any openings over there at your
          extract place?

                         JOEL

                         (EXASPERATED SIGH)
          Brad, you had sex with my wife.
          I'm not gonna give you a job, okay?

                         BRAD
          Okay... Sorry man.
          Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat,
          thinking. He calls out to Brad.

                         JOEL
          Hey Brad?...
          Brad stops.

                         BRAD
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... Maybe come by the
          office tomorrow. Fill out an
          application. I'll see what I can
          do.

                         BRAD
          Cool. Thanks man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
          Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.

                         BRIAN
          We're screwed. General Mills has
          pretty much withdrawn the offer
          pending a really favorable
          settlement with Step.
          (shaking his head)
          Not only do we not sell the
          company, we could wind up bankrupt.

                         JOEL
          (muttering to himself)
          So I don't sell the company, don't
          get the money, I'm bankrupt, I
          don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to
          have sex with my wife, and she
          actually did it...

                         BRIAN
          Excuse me?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

          Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
          the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.

          NATHAN (O.S.)
          Hello?
          Nathan enters through the back gate.

                         SUZIE

                         (MUTTERS)
          Shit...
          Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
          acts as unfriendly as possible.

                         NATHAN
          Why are you cleaning the pool
          yourself? That new guy didn't work
          out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, didn't work out.

                         NATHAN
          Boy, you just can't get good help,
          eh?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          So, did you get a chance to write
          that check?

                         SUZIE
          Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
          going to that dinner okay?
          Nathan acts deeply disappointed.

                         NATHAN
          Well gee, I wish you would've told
          me that before I went and bought
          the tickets.

                         SUZIE
          Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
          and neither did I.

                         NATHAN
          Well, it sure sounded like you guys
          were going. Leslie was gonna talk
          to you about it, but you didn't
          return our calls. I mean, I
          already bought these tickets.
          They're nonrefundable. I really
          wish you guys had been a little
          more clear with me...
          It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
          all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.

                         SUZIE
          Okay, let me be really clear with
          you then. When we say "I don't
          think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
          that means "no." Why can't you
          understand that?

                         NATHAN
          Well, I just--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         SUZIE
          Shut up! In fact, let me be even
          more clear with you. We don't like
          you! Is that clear enough? You're
          dull, you never shut up, you never
          listen, and we don't want anything
          to do with you ever again!
          Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
          shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
          to stop.

                         SUZIE
          Is that clear enough for you
          Nathan?! Is that...?
          Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.

                         SUZIE

                         (WORRIED)
          Nathan?
          Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
          Suzie SCREAMS.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing
          something on the other side of the lot that gets his
          attention.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No way...
          From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
          Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
          the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
          He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
          He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
          determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
          door.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Cindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but
          pleasant to him.

                         CINDY
          Oh... Joel. I ah,...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JOEL
          Hi.

                         CINDY
          What're you...? What's up? How'd
          you know I was here?

                         JOEL
          Ah, actually, I'm staying here too.
          Down on the first floor, around the
          back. I thought I saw you so I
          ah...

                         CINDY
          Well, come in.
          Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to
          the kitchen.

          CINDY (O.S.)
          Do you want something to drink? I
          think all I have is Diet Coke.
          Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He
          stares at it.

                         JOEL
          No thanks.
          Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.

                         CINDY
          Have a seat.
          Joel remains standing, looking at the purse.

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse... Isn't it?

                         CINDY
          What?

                         JOEL
          Right there. That's Mary's purse.

                         CINDY
          Oh that? No, that's mine... So
          how are things at work?

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse. You stole it,
          didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
           Cindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her
          demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying.

                         CINDY
          No. It probably just looks like
          it. There's a lot of those.

                         JOEL
          I've never seen another one. You
          probably have Sylvia's wallet in
          here somewhere too, don't you? And
          everything else that's been stolen
          from my employees.

                         CINDY
          Joel, are you okay?

                         JOEL
          No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse
          Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed
          Hector. He almost got fired.
          Doesn't that bother you?

                         CINDY
          (innocent, sweet)
          Joel, I don't know what you're--

                         JOEL
          Hector! Hard working guy, never
          did anything wrong. And what are
          you doing with Step? You're trying
          to screw him out of his settlement
          money aren't you?

                         CINDY
          I have no idea what you're talking
          about.

                         JOEL
          Yes you do! You're the only reason
          he's suing us aren't you? You know
          how much work it took for me to
          build up that company? You just
          don't care about anybody do you?
          What are you, some kind of
          sociopath?
          Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't even admit that you stole
          this purse can you? You just can't
          do it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          In fact, you probably can't tell
          the truth about much of anything,
          can you?...
          Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.

                         JOEL
          I bet Cindy's not even your real
          name is it? Who are you? Where
          the hell are you from?
          Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't answer can you? Because
          if you said one true thing, you'd
          have to tell the truth about
          something else and then it would
          all unravel wouldn't it? Then
          you'd have to admit that you stole
          this purse and God knows what else.
          Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see
          her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.

                         JOEL

                         (COMPOSES HIMSELF)
          Well, I'm leaving now.
          Joel picks up the purse.

                         JOEL
          And I'm taking this purse with me.
          If it really is yours, you can call
          the police and tell 'em I stole
          it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
          police and report it...
          Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
          couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
          her voice cracking slightly.

                         CINDY
          Please don't...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CINDY
          (still looking down)
          Please don't report it to the
          police. I'm on probation. I'll go
          to jail. For a long time.

                         JOEL
          Well... Maybe you should've thought
          about that before you started
          ripping off my employees.
          Joel starts to open the door.

                         CINDY
          Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
          alone. I promise. He'll drop the
          lawsuit.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          How do I know that?

                         CINDY
          You can keep the purse. If I don't
          leave him alone; if he doesn't drop
          the lawsuit, then you can report
          me. Please?
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
          have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
          watch? Can I get those too?
          Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.

                         JOEL
          Well... Okay then. I guess that
          works.

                         (REALIZING)
          And I guess you just admitted that
          you stole the purse. That's good,
          I guess... A step in the right
          direction...
          Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
          Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
          straight ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         JOEL
          So what's your deal anyway?... I
          mean, how did you end up like this?
          Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
          caught off guard.

                         JOEL
          .Ah... Cindy?
          Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay, now you see... that's what
          I'm talking about. You're trying
          to manipulate me now, and I'm not
          gonna fall for it...
          Cindy starts bawling even harder.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you're not faking
          this right now, because I'm feeling
          really bad. Are you faking it?
          Cindy shakes her head "no."

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I was just curious, you
          know, how a person ends up like...
          this...
          Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
          Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
          comfort her in any way.

                         JOEL
          Never mind. I'm sorry...
          Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
          leans in to him, crying on his chest.
          He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
          closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start
          kissing. As they get hot and heavy we

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- MORNING

          Wide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM - DAY

          Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
          We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
          sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.

                         JOEL
          Cindy?
          He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
          worried.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA -- MORNING

          Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.
          Mary and Gabriella gossiping.

                         MARY
          (looks at her watch)
          Joel hasn't been in all morning.
          can you believe that?

                         GABRIELLE
          If we come in late, we get fired.
          And here we're working our tails
          off, and he's gonna get rich.
          Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He
          walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.

                         JOEL
          Here you go Mary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Joel hands her the purse. Mary looks at it, not quite sure
          how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
          anything -- not in her nature.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          And by the way, Hector didn't take
          it. Cindy did.
          Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She
          whispers to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          Can you believe that? Blaming
          Cindy just to protect Hector.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in.

                         BRIAN
          Step's here to see you.

                         JOEL
          Really? Bring him in.

                         BRIAN
          No, he's outside. At the loading
          dock. Wants to talk to you alone
          back there for some reason.

                         (CRUDE IMMITATION)
          "Man to man."

          EXT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - LOADING DOCK

          Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.

                         JOEL
          Hi Step...

                         STEP
          Hey.

                         JOEL
          How you doin'? How's your, ah...

                         STEP
          (looking down at his

                         CROTCH)
          Oh it's okay. Some days it still
          hurts, but they've got me on some
          pills. It's not too bad I guess...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         JOEL
          Well... that's good.
          They both sit down on the edge of the dock.

                         STEP
          Look, ah... Cindy left me.
          Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.

                         JOEL
          Wow... Bummer...

                         STEP
          Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
          thought the worst part was having
          my balls knocked off, but you know
          what the worse part is? Dealin'
          with all this bullshit... I'm sick
          of that Adler guy tellin' me what
          to do. He's a real dick.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, he sure is.

                         STEP
          The truth is, I just want to have
          my old life back -- I just want to
          go back to work. I'm a workin'
          man; that's what I do.

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
          might be the same way... I'm a
          little worried about what I'd do
          with too much time on my hands.

                         STEP
          I just lay around and watch TV all
          day.

                         JOEL
          Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.

                         STEP
          The problem is, if I bankrupt the
          company, there won't be a job to go
          back to.

                         JOEL
          You don't have to bankrupt the
          company.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STEP
          Yeah, but then if I drop the
          lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
          and the new company might not hire
          me.

                         JOEL
          Well, maybe I don't have to sell
          the company... You know I've been
          thinking; all these years I've been
          building this company, dreaming
          about the day I could sell it and
          retire, but what would I really do
          if I retired? It's like that old
          saying -- it's not about the
          destination, it's about the
          journey?
          Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.

                         JOEL
          I guess what I'm saying is, too
          much free time might not be such a
          good thing -- like that old saying,
          idle hands are the Devil's
          playground?
          Step's never heard that one either.

                         STEP
          I'm sorry, I don't do much book
          readin'.

                         JOEL
          What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
          maybe I won't sell the company...

                         STEP
          Really?

                         JOEL
          that is, if you dropped the
          lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
          still get that insurance money --
          probably a couple hundred thousand.
          What do you think?

                         STEP
          Hmm. That sounds fair... But
          under one condition...

                         JOEL
          What's that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STEP
          You make me floor manager.

                         JOEL
          Deal.
          They shake hands.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA

          Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
          employees.

                         JOEL
          Hold the line!
          Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.

                         JOEL
          Okay, listen up everybody.
          (Waits for them to settle)
          I've decided not to sell the
          company...
          Gasps and murmurs among the employees.

                         JOEL
          And I'm making Step the new Floor
          Manager.
          More gasps and murmurs.

                         JOEL
          And if anyone doesn't like it, I
          hear they're hiring over at
          Gemco... But just remember, at
          Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
          names; you never even meet him,
          he's at an office up in Chicago
          somewhere and you get an auto-
          response if you try to email him to
          complain about anything. Here, you
          can come up to my office any time
          you have a problem. Thanks.
          Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.

                         BRIAN
          Huh? You're not selling?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         JOEL
          It's about the journey Brian. The
          journey.
          ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.

                         MARY
          You know, if Joel's going to put
          him in charge, we should go on
          strike. You know, at Gemco, the
          union handles the strikes and you
          don't even have to--
          PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.

                         STEP
          Quit yapping and get back to work
          or you're fired.
          Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
          Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
          LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.

          INT. CHAPEL - DAY

          We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
          to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
          Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
          then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
          sitting by herself, dressed in black.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground
          as the priest says the last few words.

          EXT. CEMETERY - A LITTLE LATER

          People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks
          over to her.

                         JOEL
          Hi... You doing okay?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, I'm okay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         JOEL
          I heard you were right there when
          it happened. That must've been
          rough.

                         SUZIE
          It was horrible Joel. He came over
          to ask for that check, and I
          just...
          Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .I just lost it. I started
          yelling at him. I said horrible
          things. He had an aneurism and I
          probably caused it.

                         (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
          I think the last thing I said to
          him was "shut up." Those were the
          last words he heard.
          Joel hugs her, consoling.

                         JOEL
          It's okay, it's not your fault...
          It's not your fault.
          Suzie's crying subsides a little.

                         SUZIE
          It could happen to any of us Joel.
          Any of us could have an aneurism.
          We could die at any moment.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know... I know... But we
          probably won't. It'll be alright.
          Suzie starts to regain her composure.
          They stand there for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You wanna go get something to
          eat... or something?
          Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, okay. Sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
          Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.

                         JOEL
          Here...

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.
          They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.

                         JOEL
          Maybe we should've been married in
          a Church like that one. Instead of
          the Botanical Gardens.

                         SUZIE
          I thought you liked the Botanical
          Gardens?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but... a church just seems
          more -- I don't know -- official.

                         SUZIE
          You think it would've made a
          difference?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... So, are we still
          married?

                         SUZIE
          Well, legally yes.

                         JOEL
          I mean otherwise.

                         SUZIE
          Hmmm... We can talk about it I
          suppose.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          They walk for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You know, this is really bad,
          but... Oh never mind.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         JOEL
          Well, as I was looking down at
          Nathan there, I was thinking...
          That's the longest I've ever seen
          him with his mouth shut.
          Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.

                         SUZIE
          Joel!
          They walk off into the distance as we

          FADE OUT.

	"THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS"


	FADE IN:

	JACK BAKER

	is standing before a dirty window, looking
	out at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey.

	WIDEN ANGLE

	It's the GIRL from this afternoon.

				JACK
		Hey.

	Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the
	bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment.  
	Not good.

				GIRL
		Whatcha doin' over there?

				JACK
		Gotta go.

				GIRL
		How come?

				JACK
		Job.

	The Girl glances at the bedside clock.

				GIRL
		Funny hours.

				JACK
		Funny job.

				GIRL
		Will I see you again?

	Jack looks out at the dirty street again.

				JACK
		No.

	The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.

				GIRL
			(at the tux)
		You weren't wearing that, were
		you? Earlier.

	Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on
	the sill.

				JACK
		Brought it.

				GIRL
		Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

				JACK
		Thanks.

				GIRL
		I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone
		who wore that shit.

	Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to
	the door.

				GIRL
			(continuing)
		Hey.
			(as he stops)
		You got great hands.


	EXT.  STREET - JACK

	Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
	a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
	the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
	all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
	he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
	goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  
	Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
	the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.

				DOORMAN
		Hey, Jackie!

				JACK
		How goes it, Tommy?

				TOMMY (DOORMAN)
			(shrugging)
		Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

				JACK
		Losing his teeth.

				TOMMY
		No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.
		I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust
		the taps.

				JACK
		Yeah.
			(standing back)
		Jesus, you look like fucking
		royalty, Tommy.

	Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.

				TOMMY
		Yeah.  The big boys sent it down
		yesterday.

				JACK
		Another five years, huh?

				TOMMY
		Like clockwork.  You got a good
		memory, Jackie.

				JACK
		It ain't always a blessing.  My
		brother here?

				TOMMY
			(nodding)
		He's got blood in his eye.

	Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and
	moves into the hotel.


	INT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK

	Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the
	lounge when he sees Jack approaching.

				FRANK
		Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could
		make it.

				JACK
		How we doing?

				FRANK
		How we ... ? What, are you kidding
		me?

				JACK
		Am I late?

				FRANK
		That's not the point.

				JACK
			(taking out a cigarette)
		What's the point?

				FRANK
		You cannot continue to walk in at
		the last moment, Jack.

				JACK
		You want me to show up late a few
		nights?

				FRANK
		Jack.

				JACK
		Frank.

				FRANK
		Jack.

				JACK
		Frank.  I'm here.  I always get
		here.  Don't sweat it.

				FRANK
		Christ, will you look at your hair?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny
	tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.

				JACK
		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK
		You look like you just crawled out
		of bed.

				JACK
		No one's gonna be looking at my
		hair.  Come on, we're on.

	Frank just stands there, bottled up with
	exasperation.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your
		tie starts to spin.


	Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his
	head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard
	stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
	of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,
	this: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
	Fabulous Baker Boys!"

	BAKER BROTHERS

	as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
	and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent
	that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a
	poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.

	WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE

	As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables
	of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
	daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.
	After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and
	the couples applaud.

				FRANK
			(Mr.  Smile)
		Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome
		to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker
		and eighty-eight keys across from me is my
		little brother, Jack.

	Applause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes
	a draw on his cigarette.

				FRANK
			(continuing; could do this in his sleep)
		You know, my brother and I have been playing
		together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it
		been, Jack?

				JACK
		Twenty-eight years, Frank.

	Applause.

				FRANK
		That's a lot of water under the
		bridge, eh, Jack?

				JACK
		Lotta water.

				FRANK
		Of course, back then, things were a little
		different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just
		about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie
		Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would
		listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.
			(to Jack)
		We must have shaved three lives off that cat,
		eh, Jack?

	Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of
	razor blades.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since
		Jack and I first stepped on the stage as
		professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,
		and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...
		well, believe me, we've seen our share of this
		crazy country of ours.  But even though we've
		played some of the finest venues in the world ...

	At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		... There's one place that's always been, for us,
		a very special place, and that place is... this
		place, the Starfire lounge.

	Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's
		the ...
			(pregnant moment)
		... people.

	At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard
	and give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.'


	JACK AND FRANK - LATER
	They exit the stage to applause.


				FRANK
		Thank you.  Remember, room service is available
	till one A.M. for you late-nighters.


	INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

	Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.

				FRANK
		Don't make trouble, all right?

				JACK
		Who's gonna make trouble?
			(spotting someone)
		Hey, amigo!


	JACK'S POV - MAN

	in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,
	looks up.

	BACK TO SCENE

				MAN
		Jack!
			(lower)
		Frank.

				FRANK
			(the feeling's mutual)
		Yeah, hi, Hector.

				HECTOR (MAN)
			(re: the soup bone)
		For Eddie.  I wrap.

				JACK
		Gracias.

				FRANK
			(as they exit)
		I mean it, Jack.  Behave.

				JACK
		Like an angel.


	INT.  OFFICE

	Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,
	despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal
	attitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays
	in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture
	any further is to risk contracting some hideous
	disease.

				LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)
			(preparing a cash envelope)
		Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.

				FRANK
		Thanks, Lloyd.

				LLOYD
		Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night
		like this.

				FRANK
		Uh ... thanks.

	Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left
	him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.

				LLOYD
		Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you
		wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go
		play with the niggers on State Street.  These
		blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some
		guy dripping ash all over himself while he's
		playing 'The Sound of Music.'

	ANGLE - JACK

	Smoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,
	like a pit bull eyeing a steak.

	BACK TO SCENE

				LLOYD
		Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more
	lessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.

	Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,
	business closed, busies himself with other matters.

				FRANK
		Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us
	back, do you, Lloyd?

				LLOYD
		I'll call you.

				FRANK
		Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I
	thought maybe...

				LLOYD
		I'll call you.

	Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.

				JACK
		Count it.

				FRANK
		Huh?

				JACK
		Count it.

				FRANK
		Jack...

				JACK
		Count the fucking money, Frank.

	Lloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him.
	Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.

				FRANK
		It's all here.
			(pulling Jack out)
		I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

	Lloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling
	with amusement.


	EXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK

	Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
	soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard
	stand-up under his arm.

				FRANK
		You mind telling me what that was about in there?
		Was that planned?  
		Or were you just bored and decided
		to get creative?

				JACK
		Fuck him.

				FRANK
		This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on
		Route 81, Jack.

				JACK
		Fuck him.

				FRANK
			(to himself)
		Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.

	The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
	Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
	the stand-up away.

				JACK
		So we on tomorrow night?

				FRANK
			(shaking his head)
		Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the
		Sheraton's got appendicitis.

	Jack nods and starts to walk away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey.

	Jack stops.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Listen ... why don't you come out to the house
		this weekend.  Say hello to the kids.  
		They've grown.

				JACK
		I hate your kids, Frank.

				FRANK
		You're their uncle.

				JACK
		Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

				FRANK
		They don't.  They're always asking about you.

				JACK
		They tried to electrocute me, Frank.

				FRANK
		It was an accident.

				JACK
		It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little
		one ...

				FRANK
		Cindy.

				JACK
		She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.  
		How do you explain that?

				FRANK
		She didn't know what she was doing.
		You're too sensitive.

				JACK
		You got weird kids, Frank.

				FRANK
		Look, I just thought if you came out you might
		see what you're missing.

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Just think about it, all right?
		Consider it a standing offer.

	Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.

				FRANK
			(continuing;like a litany)
		You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,
		I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.
		Good night, Frank.

	Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.
	Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance,
	then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
	for home.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING

	Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
	building, where a black labrador is studying him from
	a second story window.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
	cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone
	booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,
	EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not
	an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
	face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.

				JACK
		Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the
		apartment.

	Eddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper
	and hands it over.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular
		Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth
		around here.

	Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
	to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  
	He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
	MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the
	tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
	walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling
	back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
	gently on the keys and stares out the open window,
	listening to the music.


	INT.  PIANO STORE

	Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano
	showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.
	WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap
	upright, contemplating his shoes.

				FRANK
		What happened to the two Clays, Willie?

				WILLIE
		Out.

				FRANK
		When they coming in?

				WILLIE
		Wednesday next.
		Frank looks across the room at Jack.


				FRANK
		What d'ya got?,

				JACK
		Bosen black.
			(taps a key)
		Flat.

				FRANK
		What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

				WILLIE
		What's the gig?

				FRANK
		Two nights.

	Willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.
	Frank frowns and glances around.
	Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		What d'ya got?

				JACK
			(tapping)
		Yamaha white.  Nice.

	Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
	his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.

				FRANK
		What do you think?

				JACK
		Try the black Knable.

	Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process,
	watching Jack for a verdict.
	After a moment, Jack nods.

				FRANK
		Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,
		Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.

				WILLIE
		My pleasure.


	INT.  DINER

	The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,
	Jack nursing an ice coffee,
	Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  
	The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
	of neighborhood luminaries,
	including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.

				FRANK
		You know, I think it's been five years since I
		saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.

				JACK
		Trust me, you're not missing anything.

				FRANK
		You look awful.

				JACK
		Thanks.

				FRANK
		Really.  You sleeping?

				JACK
		Only on odd days.

				FRANK
			(a look)
		Seeing anyone in particular?

				JACK
		Why the interest?

				FRANK
		Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about
		you. Because sometimes it seems like the most
		significant relationship in your life is with
		that goddamn dog of yours.

	Jack studies his brother's face.

				JACK
		I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.

				FRANK
		What about that waitress at the Ambassador?

				JACK
		Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

				FRANK
		Funny.
			(points at his wedding band)
		Strike a bell?

				JACK
		It's only a ring.  Not a collar.

				FRANK
		It's more than that.

	Jack smiles and sips his coffee.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

				JACK
		No thanks.

				FRANK
		No, I mean it.

				JACK
		So do I.

				FRANK
		We gotta go, Jack.

				JACK
		No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up
		there every couple weeks you feel guilty.  
		I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

				FRANK
		This time you gotta go.

				JACK
		I don't gotta go.

				FRANK
		You gotta go.

				JACK
		Says who?

				FRANK
		Your older brother.

				JACK
		You're thirteen months older than me, Frank.
		That might've meant something in the Apache
		clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.

				FRANK
		Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.

	Jack glances up.  Frank nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		So what do you say?
		Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?

	Jack squints out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Okay.  And don't worry about a present.
		I got her something from both of us.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,
	gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street
	on which he grew up.

				FRANK
		Make sure you lock.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
	three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth
	of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.
	But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.

	BACK TO SCENE

				FRANK
		Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to
		mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.  
		Times've changed, huh?
			(pointing)
		See the tree?
		Remember the job Cecil did on it the day
		Dad planted it?
		You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.
		I was looking at it just the other day.
		Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.

	Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,
	then raps on the front door.
	Jack studies the tree a moment,
	then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.

				JACK
		So what'd we get her?

				FRANK
		You'll see.

	ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

	At that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
	is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.

				MRS. BAKER
		Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

				FRANK
		How's the birthday girl?

				MRS. BAKER
		A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

	Mrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,
	embraces Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
			(continuing)
		John.  It's good to see you.

				JACK
			(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)
		Good to see you, Ma.

	Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and
	mimics "John" with a knowing nod.

				FRANK
		Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.
		Jack. He goes by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
		I thought maybe held gotten over that.

				FRANK
		Twenty years, Ma ...

				MRS. BAKER
		Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.
		Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
		we had a pig on the farm named Jack.
		I guess I just can't help making the association.

	Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
	holds his brother personally responsible for this.

				FRANK
		Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,
		John Kennedy went by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
		Catholics.  What do you expect?  
		Oh, well, what's in a name, right?
		Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

	As Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.

				FRANK
		Keep her busy, will ya?
		I have to set a few things up.

	Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch
	with the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head,
	wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,
	then enters the house.

	INT.  HOUSE

	The front room is cluttered with his childhood.  
	Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
	perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed
	with age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,
	are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.
	Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,
	piled everywhere in drunken stacks.
	This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,
	warily, but with a noticeable dispassion,
	until his eyes fall upon a photograph.
	In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man
	in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.

	Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,
	perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,
	his shirt too big, is caught in profile,
	looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(entering)
		Well, now, where's everyone run off to?
		Frank?

				JACK
		Downstairs.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh.

	All at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.

				MRS. BAKER
		Well, shall we cut that cake?

	Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen.
	He places the box on the table and stands off to the
	side while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.

				MRS. BAKER
		So. How are you?

				JACK
		Fine.  You?

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh, fine.

	Silence.
	Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.
	Her fingers are trembling.

				MRS. BAKER
			(continuing)
		Big piece or little?

				JACK
		Huh? Oh, no.

				MRS. BAKER
		None?

				JACK
		I'm not much for sweets.

	Mrs. Baker nods.


				MRS. BAKER
		How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

				JACK
		Eddie.

				MRS. BAKER
		Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?

				JACK
		He's losing his teeth.

	Mrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.
	Suddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.

				MRS. BAKER
		Sounds like your brothers back with us.


	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

	Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
	old movie projector and a roll-up screen.

				MRS. BAKER
			(entering)
		What's all this?

	Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
	tiny ribboned box.

				FRANK
		Go on.

	Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker
	pulls the ribbon off the box.  
	Inside is a tiny spool of film.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Why, what's this?


	INT.  KITCHEN (LATER)

	Blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.  
	Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.  
	Mrs. Baker close on his elbow,
	sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.  
	Jack sits off to the side.  
	A title card appears:
	"For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible."
	Mrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.  
	He just smiles.

	Suddenly, images spring to the screen,
	obviously footage several years old,
	showing Jack and Frank as children,
	sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,
	smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh my God ...

				FRANK
		Recognize these two characters?

				MRS. BAKER
		I thought these were lost.  
		Where did you find ...

				FRANK
		In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.
			(pointing with his fork)
		Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.

	As Frank's laughter fills the dark room,
	Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen.  
	Suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,
	in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.

				MRS. BAKER
			(laughing)
		Oh no!

				FRANK
		I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
		all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't
		fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

	Jack says nothing.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh, look at you two.  So skinny.
		And those tiny suits ...

				FRANK
		Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

	Jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year
	and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.  
	He is so tall his face cannot be seen.  
	As he dances quickly out of sight,
	he ruffles Jack's hair.

				MRS. BAKER
		That man.

	As the film jumps again,
	Jack glances at the photograph to his right.
	The images on the screen flicker softly off
	the glass of the picture frame.

				MRS.  BAKER (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Oh, look how you're growing.
		My little boys ...

	Jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother
	and brother, sitting close together in the love seat,
	laughing.  After a moment, their voices fade and Jack
	looks back to the children on the screen,
	like two tiny men, mirror images of one another.
	At first the changes are subtle.  
	Little Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.
	But as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one
	another less and less, until finally,
	the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in
	his place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in
	rumpled coat and open collar,
	a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  
	A woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the
	offending cigarette away in a flash.


	INT.  CAR

	Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.
	Whispers of steam snake from the
	mancovers in the street.

				JACK
		I made her nervous.

				FRANK
		What do you mean?

				JACK
		Her hands.  Like that.

	Jack holds out a trembling hand.

				FRANK
		Nah.  Medication.

	Jack looks over at Frank.  He nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Couple years, now.
			(taps his heart)
		Keeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.

	Jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.

				FRANK
		She was glad to see you.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops.
	Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.
	Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
	the bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin,
	he pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.


	EXT.  STREET - DAWN

	The next morning.  Early.  
	The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
	beginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly,
	RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"
	-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,
	over and over.


	IHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering
	Eddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room,
	seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.
	She stops playing and turns.

				NINA
		Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.

	Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.
	He nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.

	Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.


				NINA
			(continuing)
		Did you break a cup, Jack?

				JACK
		Eddie did.

	Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,
	then brings Jack his coffee with both hands.

				NINA
		I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.
		I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'

	Jack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.
	Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Guess they're up.

				JACK
		Sounds big.  What's he do?

				NINA
		Process server.
		Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours
		are more regular.  All I know's he came to take
		the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
		dinner.  And breakfast.

				JACK
		What happened to the donut king?

				NINA
		Married.

	Upstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
	stairwell. Nina peers out the window.

				NINA
		No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.

	TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Well, gotta go.  Teach me later?

	Jack nods.
	Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
	Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.

				JACK
		Hey.


	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses
	of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence
	seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,
	giving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment.  
	Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't
	fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause
	is less than volcanic.

				FRANK
		Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this
		evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed
		yourselves as much as we did.

	As the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,
	a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.

				BELLHOP
		Mr. Baker.

				FRANK
			(tired)
		Yeah, Jimmy.

				JIMMY (BELLHOP)
		Mr. Simpson asked to see you.

				FRANK
		All right, tell him I'll be right there.

	As Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'


	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR

		Frank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."
		It's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,
		a heavy man in a shiny suit,
		is throwing darts in the general direction of a
		dartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.

				CHARLIE
		Frankie.

				FRANK
		You wanted to see me, Charlie?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, come on in.

				FRANK
		Little slow tonight.

				CHARLIE
			(waving it off)
		Mondays.

	Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it
	to Frank.

				FRANK
		What's this?

				CHARLIE
		Your pay.

				FRANK
		Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

				CHARLIE
		Take it now.

				FRANK
			(confused)
		What about tomorrow?

				CHARLIE
		We don't need you, Frankie.

	For a moment, Frank just stands there.

				FRANK
		I've got the grands for two nights,
		Charlie.  You can't just --

				CHARLIE
		It's all there.  Both nights.

	Frank looks at the envelope in his hands.


				FRANK
		What're you saying, Charlie?

				CHARLIE
		Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been
		playing here, a long time.

				FRANK
		Twelve years.

				CHARLIE
		Right, twelve years.  Couple times
		a month.

				FRANK
		So?

				CHARLIE
		So maybe it's time we took a vacation from
		each other.

				FRANK
		Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.
		You said so yourself.

				CHARLIE
		It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.
		I got six waiters standing in back listening
		to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.  
		To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.  
		It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.
		I love both you guys, you know that.  
		You're class.  But people today.  
		They don't know class if it walks up and
		grabs 'em by the balls.


	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with
	the cardboard stand-up.

				JACK
		What's with Charlie?

				FRANK
		Nothing.  Everything's great.
		Terrific.


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	With the stand-up under his arm,
	Frank enters and closes the door quietly.  
	A light is glowing in the kitchen.  
	The rest of the house is dark, quiet.  In the kitchen,
	he checks the message pad by the phone.  Nothing.  
	On the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.
	Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:
	"Frank. Please."
	Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.  
	The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.  
	Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer,
	Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and
	replaces it with a new one.  
	As he presses the photograph in place,
	his eyes drift to the one of himself.  
	It was taken a long time ago.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
	piano by the window.  As the needle hits the spinning
	disc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout
	the apartment.  Jack takes a drink, then joins in with
	the record, playing along.  His concentration is intense,
	so much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,
	he seems not to hear it.  Finally, he picks it up.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		It's me.

				JACK
		Frank?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the
		house tomorrow, will ya?

				JACK
		I've had enough family for one
		month, Frank.

				FRANK (V.0.)
		It's not family.  It's business.

				JACK
		So talk to me tomorrow.  After
		the gig.

				FRANK (V.0.)
		We don't get a gig.

				JACK
		What're you talking about?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		Something came up.  Don't worry,
		Charlie stayed true.  Both nights.
		I'll give you your share tomorrow.
		At the house.

	Silence.

				FRANK (V.0)
			(continuing)
		So you'll come out, right?

				JACK
		Yeah, okay.

	Jack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,
	then the CONNECTION goes DEAD.


	EXT.  STREET

	A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.  
	In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap
	gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.  
	He walks up to the door of a small white house and
	presses the doorbell.
	When there is no response, he goes around to the back.

	EXT. BACKYARD

	The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence
	surrounding it.  Two kids, a girl and a boy,
	are splashing around in a build-it-yourself
	above-ground pool.  
	When they see Jack, they stop splashing.
	Only their heads are visible above the water.

				JACK
		Hey, kids.  Dad home?

	The two heads say nothing.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		What d'ya say?  Wanna run and get
		him for me?

	Still nothing.  Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,
	and pats his pocket for a match.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Shit.

	The kids' eyes widen at his profanity.  
	Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,
	ponders things for a moment,
	then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.
	At which point,
	the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Hey, kid.  Take it easy.

	No use.  The kid's a world-class screamer.  
	Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,
	comes racing out of the house.

				FRANK
		Cindy!  What is it?

	Cindy points.  At Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jack.

				JACK
		Your doorbell doesn't work.

				FRANK
		Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You
		remember Uncle Jack.

	DONNA, Frank's wife, appears.

				DONNA
		What's the matter?  Jack?

	Jack waves.

				FRANK
			(lifting Cindy out of the pool)
		Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?

				DONNA
		I'll take her inside.  You too,
		little Frank.  Out of the pool.

	Donna shepherds the kids toward the house.

				FRANK
		Feet!

	The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
	and disappear into the house.  Frank turns to Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		It's probably the excitement of
		seeing you again.


	EXT.  BACKYARD (LATER)

	Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.
	The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
	aluminum chairs.

				FRANK
		Well, look at this.

				DONNA
		You bring trunks, Jack?

				JACK
		Trunks?

				DONNA
		Swimming trunks.

				JACK
		Oh. No. Strictly dryland.

				DONNA
		Too bad.  You could use some sun.
		Really.

				JACK
		Maybe next time.

				DONNA
		We have some lotion.

				JACK
		Just the same.

				DONNA
		Suit yourself.

	Donna returns to the house.
	Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
	surroundings complacently.

				FRANK
		Nice, huh?

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.

				JACK
		Terrific.

				FRANK
			(expansively)
		Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.
		After the rains.  Look good as new.

				JACK
		You ask me out here to sell me
		your house, Frank?

	Frank shakes the ice in his glass.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Charlie paid you off last night,
		didn't he?

				FRANK
		I don't know what you mean.

				JACK
		The hell you don't.

				FRANK
		I told you.  Something came up.
		Some political dinner or something.

				JACK
		Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank.
		No one paid us off.

				FRANK
		It wasn't like that.

				JACK
		No?

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
		What was it like?

				FRANK
		Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?  
		I got two kids. I got a wife.
		Besides, he made the deal.  
		There's no shame in it.

				JACK
		That how you see it?


				FRANK
		Yeah, that's how I see it.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And don't go shaking your head, little brother.
		I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling
		like he's got a day job in a piss factory.
			(pause)
		It killed him, you know.

	Jack glances up.  Dangerous territory.

				JACK
		A gust of wind killed him.

				FRANK
		Yeah, and what put him up there?

				JACK
		Hey, you weren't there.  Right?

	Jack's look ends this.  Frank sighs.

				FRANK
		Look, can we forget last night?
		We gotta talk.

				JACK
		Talk.

				FRANK
		I been thinking maybe we should
		make some changes.
			(pause)
		I been thinking maybe we should
		take on a singer.

	Silence.

				JACK
		Sure, why not.

				FRANK
		It's just an idea.  I want your opinion.
		I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?

				JACK
		It's more like 40-60, wouldn't
		you say?

				FRANK
		We agreed that if I took care of the business;
		I'd be entitled to the extra.
		Isn't that what we agreed?

				JACK
		That's what we agreed.

				FRANK
		If you're unhappy with the
		arrangement --

				JACK
		I'm not unhappy.

				FRANK
		If you'd like to assume more of the financial
		responsibilities, I'd be glad --

				JACK
		Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?

				FRANK
		I've tried to do well by you, Jack.
		By both of us.

				JACK
		I'm grateful, Frank.  How much?
		For the singer.

				FRANK
		I thought maybe twenty percent.
		Look, with the additional bookings we'll
		come out ahead.  The big hotels,
		they want a pretty girl with a big voice.
		We have to stay competitive, Jack.

	Jack laughs coldly.

				FRANK
		What's that?

				JACK
		You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me
		we're different.  We got novelty, Jack.
		No one can touch us.

				FRANK
		Two pianos isn't enough anymore,
		Jack.

				JACK
		It never was.


	YOUNG WOMAN

	in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
	center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano
	showroom, holding some sheet music.  Sammy Davis Jr.'s
	face is on the sheet music.  Frank is sitting against
	the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.  
	Jack is at the piano.

				FRANK
		Good morning, Miss...?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Moran.  Monica Moran.

				FRANK
		All right, Miss Moran

				MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
		Actually, that's my stage name.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry?

				MONICA
		Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing.  
		It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.

				FRANK
		Blanche.

				MONICA
		No romance, right?  That's why I came up with
		Monica. It's what I prefer.

				FRANK
		Well, that's fine --

				MONICA
		But if you call my house and my mother answers,
		ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll
		think you have the wrong number and hang up.

				FRANK
		Right.

				MONICA
		And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.
		She's opposed to my career.

				FRANK
		Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what
		is it you'd like to do for us?

				MONICA
		Candy Man.'
			(worried)
		Is that all right?

				FRANK
		It's one of Jack's favorites.

	Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,
	gives a little start.

				MONICA
		Oops.  I almost forgot you were
		there.  Here's the music.

	Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.

				FRANK
		Uh... he knows it.

				MONICA
		Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.

				JACK
		Small world.

	Monica smiles.  She likes Jack.

				FRANK
		Well, shall we?

	Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,
	laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
	swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,
	Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
	has to scramble over a chord to catch her,
	sort of like a fireman with a net.

				MONICA
		Who can take a sunrise
		Sprinkle it with dew
		Toss it in the air and
		Make a groovy lemon pie
		The Candy Man can
		The Candy Man can...,

	There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
	mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
	daughter's career.

				FRANK
		Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

	Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.
	Frank looks over at Jack.  
	Jack shrugs and continues to play.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...
		Blanche!

	Monica's eyes pop open.

				MONICA
		Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in
		it sometimes.  It's scary.

				FRANK
		Yes, it is.

				MONICA
		Well ... thanks.
			(to Jack)
		Bye.

				JACK
		Drive carefully.

	As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another
	and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
	singers who can't sing.  As Frank sinks lower in his
	chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded
	cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,
	and colors, come forth to offer their own unique
	interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"
	"This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
	"What Kind of Fool Am I."
	Finally, when it is all over,
	Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,
	looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.


	TALL YOUNG WOMAN

	As the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
	walks into Willie's.  She glances around,
	then spots Willie across the room,
	eating a corn beef on rye.

				WOMAN
		Hey.  You one of the fabulous
		Baker Boys?


	JACK AND FRANK

	are putting on their coats, preparing to leave.
	Frank is staring at his notepad.

				FRANK
		Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		Thirty-seven girls.
		And not one who can carry a tune.
		That must be statistically impossible.

				JACK
		It was a somewhat extraordinary
		day.

				FRANK
		I just don't understand.  You
		would think someone ... anyone ...

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Damn!

	The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,
	holding a shoe in her hand.  It's broken.

				WOMAN
			(continuing)
		Brand new Thursday.  You believe
		it?

	After today, Jack and Frank are prepared
	to believe anything.

				WOMAN
			(continuing)
		This where the auditions are?

				FRANK
		This is where the auditions were.

				WOMAN
		What do you mean?

				FRANK
		We're finished.

				WOMAN
		What about me?

	Frank looks at his watch.

				FRANK
		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN
		My watch is broken, too.

				FRANK
		Punctuality.  First rule of show
		business.

	The Woman looks around her.

				WOMAN
		This is show business?

				FRANK
			(in no mood)
		Look, miss.  We're tired,
		you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

				WOMAN
			(touching her lip)
		Just like that, huh?  You're not
		even gonna give me a chance?

				FRANK
		Don't take it personally.

				WOMAN
		How should I take it?

				FRANK
		Impersonally.

	Frank begins to leave.

				WOMAN
		I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down
		here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me
		a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a
		few minutes late.

				FRANK
		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN
		So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

				FRANK
		We ran long.

				WOMAN
		So run a little longer.

				FRANK
		Miss --

				WOMAN
		You find a girl?

	Jack and Frank glance at each other.

				JACK
		No.

				WOMAN
		So. I'm here, you're here, the
		piano's here.  What d'ya say?

	Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.

				FRANK
		Terrific.  Thirty-eight.

				WOMAN
		What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.

				JACK
		Don't worry about it.

				WOMAN
			(to Frank)
		You know, I'm feeling a lot of
		hostility from you.

				FRANK
			(appealing)
		Jack.

				JACK
		Let's get it over with.

				FRANK
		All right.  What's your name?

				WOMAN
		Susie.  Susie Diamond.

				FRANK
		Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment
		experience, Miss Diamond?

				SUSIE (WOMAN)
		Well ... for the last four years
		I've been on call to Triple A
		Escort service.

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner
		and dance.

				FRANK
		Okay.  I think that's all we
		need to know.

				SUSIE
		I sing now?

				FRANK
		That's the premise.

	Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.

				SUSIE
		I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,
		okay?

	Jack nods and begins to play.  
	Frank slouches down in his chair,
	preparing to be tortured again.

				SUSIE
			(continuing; singing)
		I get along without you very well
		Of course I do
		Except when soft rains fall
		And drip from leaves, then I recall
		The thrill of being
		Sheltered in your arms
		Of course I do
		But I get along without you very well.'

	Susie stops.  Frank just sits there.  
	Jack just sits there.  She can sing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So?

				FRANK
			(blinking)
		Uh ... we'll let you know.

	Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane.

				SUSIE
		When?

				FRANK
		When we know.

				SUSIE
			(smiling)
		Don't leave a girl hanging.
		Second rule of show business.

	Frank's not amused.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.

	Susie walks out barefoot.

				JACK
		What are you, crazy?

				FRANK
		I just thought we should talk
		about it.  Between ourselves.

				JACK
		What's there to talk about?  She can sing.  
		That puts her at the head of the class.
		That makes her the only one in the class.

				FRANK
		I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,
		for Christ sake.  
		I don't think she's right for the act.

				JACK
			(studying him)
		You're getting cold feet about
		this.

				FRANK
		I was just thinking what Ma would
		think.

				JACK
		Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the
		Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass.
		How could I forget.

	Frank frowns and looks down at his hands.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
		Donna?  Little Cindy?  
		Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.

				FRANK
		Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

	Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.

				JACK
		What's the matter?

				FRANK
		I didn't get her number.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up
	and down the street.  Nothing.

				FRANK
		We can always look her up in the
		book.

		JACK.
		Right.  Susie Diamond.  She's probably listed right
		next to Monica Moran.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Does this mean I get the job?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack and Frank whirl around.

	There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.

				SUSIE
		Intuition.


	CITY SKYLINE

	Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.  
	Once again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,
	only this time carried a little further:
	"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."


	JACK, FRANK AND SUSIE

	Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing
	for their first rehearsal ...

				FRANK
		Ready?

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

	Susie nods.  Frank poises his hands over the piano,
	hesitates, then looks at Jack again.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

	Jack squints at Frank, then nods.  
	Frank turns to Susie.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

				SUSIE
			(looking around)
		What are we, an orchestra all of
		a sudden?

	Frank g1ares at her.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sorry.


	Frank poises his hands over the piano again and
	begins to play the opening passage of
	"Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,
	and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately,
	Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,
	are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
	fifth grade recital.
	After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.

				SUSIE
		Fellas, fellas ...

	Jack and Frank stop.

				FRANK
		What's the problem?

				SUSIE
		The problem is I can't hear myself
		sing with all this...
			(searching)
		... music.  You know what I'm saying?

	Jack and Frank look at one another.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,
		but up here I'm having a little trouble
		getting a word in.

	Jack and Frank just stare.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I mean, you're supposed to be
		backing me up, right?

				FRANK
			(icily)
		No. We are not supposed to be
		backing you up.

				SUSIE
		What I mean is --

				FRANK
		We're a team.  We work together.

				SUSIE
		So work with me, not against me.
		Okay?

	Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.

				FRANK
		I suppose we can bring it down a
		little.

				JACK
		I'll drop the eighths.

				FRANK
		Okay?

	Susie looks at the two brothers.

				SUSIE
		Okay.


	WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER

	Frank is on Willie's telephone.  
	In the front of the store, just out of earshot,
	Jack sits at a beat-up grand,
	while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.

				FRANK
		I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got
		a voice like an angel ... What?

	Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,
	making a very sexy silhouette against the front window,
	is running her hand over a pearl-white piano.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		No, I wouldn't say she's got a
		body like an angel.

	As Frank continues to talk in the background,
	Susie looks over at Jack.

				SUSIE
		Hey, he's not sore, is he?

				JACK
		He'll come around.

	Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		You never sang before?

				SUSIE
		Not for money. With my mother.

	Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		She used to waitress downtown, nights,
		when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing.
		You know how people whistle when they're nervous?
		My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone
		with a song 'cause thousands of people know the
		same song and even though you can't hear 'em,
		they're singing with you.  I don't know.  
		If they were, they were all singing safe inside
		their apartments.
			(shrugging)
		But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since,
		I always wanted to sing.  
		I never took lessons or anything, though.
		I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.

	Jack looks down at the piano in front of him.

				JACK
		Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons.


	JACK AND NINA

	Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
	ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him
	at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar
	of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.

				NINA
		You shave like an old movie, Jack.

	As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins
	to soap her face in the mirror.

				JACK
		In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that
		he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he
		wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop
		and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

				NINA
		Is that what you used to do?

				JACK
		My days are not the old days,
		genius.

				NINA
		What are they?

				JACK
		The recent past.

				NINA
		Oh.
			(nodding to the ceiling)
		Bigfoot gets his out of a can.

				JACK
		How do you know?

				NINA
		I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

				JACK
		Oh?

				NINA
		I guess it's getting serious.

				JACK
		Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry
		him.

				NINA
		I hope not.  He's already busted the springs
		in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?

	Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.

				JACK
		Ivory.

				NINA
		Looks old.

				JACK
		Older than me.

				NINA
		Wow.

	Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.
	Nina picks up the razor.

				JACK
		Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow
		a beard?

				NINA
		Why not?

				JACK
		Well, let's get your first prom
		under the belt, okay?

				NINA
		What's a prom?

				JACK
		Ever go to church?

	Nina nods.

				JACK
		It's like that.  Only you gotta
		dance.


	INT.  HOTEL

	As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard
	stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby.  
	It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation
	at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist."
	On the other side of the lobby,
	Frank is pacing nervously.

				FRANK
		Where the hell is she?

				JACK
		It's early.

				FRANK
		I told everyone seven-fifteen.
		Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.

				JACK
		She'll get here.

				FRANK
		Just like the day of the auditions,
		right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?


				JACK
		Awe inspiring.

				FRANK
		Yeah, well, Your's isn't.
			(taking out a comb)
		Let me run a comb though it.

				JACK
		Get out of here.

				FRANK
		Come on, stand still.

				JACK
		Get out of here!

				FRANK
		It's not gonna hurt you.

				JACK
		I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.

	Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to
	feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair.
	Jack hits him.

				FRANK
			(holding his shoulder)
		You hit me.

				JACK
		I told you I was gonna hit you.

	He looks capable of hitting him again, too.

				FRANK
		All right, all right.  I'm a little
		tense.

				JACK
		You're a fucking alarm clock.

				FRANK
		I just wish she'd get here, that's
		all.

				JACK
		She's here.

	Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress,
	is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.

				FRANK
		Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna
		wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense
		to come in the back.
			(walking over)
		Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

				SUSIE
		Where's my name?

				FRANK
		What-?

				SUSIE
		And how come you guys are the only ones with
		your pictures on the poster?

				FRANK
		We'll talk about it later.  Right
		now, you gotta get changed.

				SUSIE
		Changed?

				FRANK
		Where's your dress?

				SUSIE
			(to Jack)
		What's he talking about?

				FRANK
		Is there a language problem here?  Your dress.
		For tonight.  Where is it?

				SUSIE
		Do I look like I'm naked?

				FRANK
		That!  You can't wear that!

				SUSIE
		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK
		It's orange!

				SUSIE
			(to Jack)
		Am I missing something?

	Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and
	pulls her toward the door.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				SUSIE
		Hey!

				FRANK
		Come on.  We don't have much time.

				SUSIE
		Time for what?


	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE

	Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous
	downtown department store, the brothers turning a few
	heads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies'
	department, Frank begins to flip through the
	dress racks.

				SUSIE
		If you ask me, this is pretty
		stupid.

				FRANK
		Just look.  What do you wear?
		A nine?

				SUSIE
			(offended)
		A seven.

				FRANK
		My wife wears a seven.  You don't
		look like a seven to me.

				SUSIE
		I wear a seven.

				FRANK
		Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?

				SUSIE
			(looking)
		Save it for your wife.

				FRANK
		We're not exactly silly with time,
		you know.  Jack, you find anything?

	Jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.

				JACK
		No.

				FRANK
		Here, how's this?

	Frank holds out an inky black dress.  Susie gives it
	a long look.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Close enough.  Let's go.

	Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.

				SUSIE
		Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I
		come from there's a little girl's room and a
		little boy's room and the little boys don't go
		where the little girls go.

				FRANK
		All right, but make it quick.
			(remembering)
		Shoes!  What size do you wear?

				SUSIE
			(from the dressing room)
		Nine.

				FRANK
		Nine?

				SUSIE
		Nine!

				FRANK
			(to himself)
		Big feet.


	INT.  SHOE DEPARTMENT

	Frank and Jack work the shoe department,
	scouting the endless rows.

				FRANK
		See anything?

				JACK
			(holding one up)
		How about these?

				FRANK
		Jack, for crying out loud.  Your
		bachelorhood's showing.
			(seeing something)
		Ah, here we go.

	Frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the
	SALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman.

				FRANK
		Hey!  Do these come in black?

				SALESMAN
		I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

				FRANK
		I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes
		or no?

				SALESMAN
			(glowering)
		Yes.  They come in black.

				FRANK
		Okay.  Give me a pair of nines.
		Pronto.

	The Salesman looks casually at Jack.

				SALESMAN
		Does he want a pair, too?


	INT.  DRESS DEPARTMENT

	As Jack and Frank return to the dress department,
	Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.

				FRANK
		All right, we got your shoes.

	Just then, Susie steps out of the dressing room.
	Even Frank stops at the sight of her.

				SUSIE
		What do you think?

				FRANK
		Uh... good.

				SUSIE
			(turning to Jack)
		Zip me up?

	The dress is open down to the small of her back.
	It's a nice back.
	Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Shoes?

				FRANK
		Right.

	Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them.

				SUSIE
		They're tight.

				FRANK
		They're nines.

				SUSIE
		Well, they're aspiring to be
		sevens.

				FRANK
		You can buy new ones tomorrow.

				SUSIE
		Oh, thanks.

				FRANK
		Don't worry.  We'll take it out
		of your share.

				SUSIE
		You're a prince.


	INT.  HOTEL

	As the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance,
	RAY, the assistant manager, appears.

				RAY
		You better buy yourself a watch,
		Frankie.

				FRANK
		We had a little emergency.

				RAY
		Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency.
		You know what I'm saying?
			(seeing Susie)
		Who's this, Minnie Pearl?

	All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the
	tags attached.

				FRANK
			(moving off)
		Jesus.

				RAY
		I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.
		You hear me?

				JACK
		This is going well, isn't it?


	INT.  KITCHEN

	The three rush into the kitchen.

				FRANK
		We need scissors over here!
		Who's got scissors?
			(turning to Susie)
		Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first,
		I do the set-up, then introduce you.
		And you say ...

				SUSIE
			(deadpan)
		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
		I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.  
		It's like a dream come true.
		And speaking of dreams ...

				FRANK
		Right.

				SUSIE
		Piece of cake.

	A tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.

				FRANK
		Carlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need
		scissors.

				CARLOS (MAN)
		No scissors.

				FRANK
		Jesus Christ.  All right.  Let's
		go, Jack.  Fix your tie.

	Jack and Frank exit.  
	Susie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver.

	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos.  
	About half the tables in the room are filled.

				FRANK
		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
		Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.  
		My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not
		seeing double, it's just my
		little brother, Jack.

	Some laughter.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,
		because we've got a very special
		evening planned ...


	INT.  KITCHEN

	Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags
	on a cutting board.  As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by,
	Susie snares a drink from her tray.

				WAITRESS
		Hey!

				SUSIE
		Just a sip.  To kill the
		butterflies, okay?

				WAITRESS
		Okay.  But no lipstick.

	Susie takes a quick sip.

				SUSIE
		There.  No one's the wiser.

				WAITRESS
		Nice dress.

	As the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down
	with a sharp chop, severing the tags.

				SUSIE
		Appreciate it, Ace.


	LOUNGE

	The audience is laughing.

				FRANK
		But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,
		looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help
		but feel some of us have met before.  We may not
		know each other's names, we might not recognize
		one another on the street, but we know each other
		just the same.  And over the years we've shared
		something.  A little music, a little drink,
		a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.  
		But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?

	Applause.  Jack puts out his cigarette.

				JACK
		Oh, brother.

				FRANK
		And it's especially nice to be among friends
		tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special
		night for my brother and I. This evening we've
		asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I
		are sure will soon seem like just another old
		friend to you all.  She's making her debut here
		this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she
		couldn't be doing it in a better place.
		Because there's one place that's always been for
		us a very special place, and that place is this
		place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen,
		please welcome a very special lady with a very
		special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

	Applause.  Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the
	busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which,
	unfortunately, is not on.

				FRANK
			(continuing; whispering)
		The switch.  Hit the switch.

				SUSIE
		Switch?
			(as she hits it)
		What fucking switch?

	Silence.

				SUSIE
			(continuing; very demure)
		Pardon me.

	Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before
	outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.  
	Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I can't tell you how thrilled I
		am to be here.

	For the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure
	how thrilled they are to be here.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I'm all smiles, darling
		Through and through...'


	INT.  LOBBY

	A BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice
	coming from the lounge, stops.  
	He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.

				BELLBOY
		I thought the Bakers were on
		tonight.

				CLERK
		They are.

				BELLBOY
		Well, who's that?

	The Clerk looks up from the register and listens.

				CLERK
		I don't know.  Frank?


	INT.  LOUNGE

	Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the
	lounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes
	closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long
	extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic,
	exhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence,
	then thunderous applause.  Magic.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	The new trio, fresh off their first gig,
	come out of the service entrance into the night.

				FRANK
		Fucking.  She says fucking in
		front of an entire room of people.

				SUSIE
		I said I was sorry.

				FRANK
			(to Jack)
		Did you hear it?

				JACK
		Fucking.

				SUSIE
		Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais
		by the time I got out there anyway.

				FRANK
			(directly to her)
		Fucking.

				SUSIE
		For Christ sake, I said it, I
		didn't do it.
			(pulling out some bills)
		Besides, I don't think they were
		too offended, do you?

				FRANK
			(grabbing the bills)
		Give me that.

				SUSIE
		Hey!

				FRANK
		We are not a saloon act.  We do
		not take tips from dirty old men.

				SUSIE
			(innocent)
		I was gonna split it with you guys.

				FRANK
		We do not take tips.  I'll apply
		this to the cost of the dress.

	Frank puts the money in his pocket.  Susie stares at
	him, steaming.

				SUSIE
		Then I want my name on the poster.
		And my picture!
			(taking off her shoes)
		And these shoes are too goddamn tight!

	Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.
	Jack is leaning against the wall,
	watching it all with amusement.

				JACK
		Nice girl.

	ON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
	"New York, New York" and we see:


	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
	another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,
	no empty tables now.

	As the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,
	newly done over with a picture of Susie and an
	accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie
	Diamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --

	CUT TO:


	INT.  LLOYD'S OFFICE

	Jack and Frank, once again in the office of the
	supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their
	cash envelope.

				LLOYD
		Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched
		onto.  She a local?

				FRANK
		Born and bred.

				LLOYD
		Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.  
		Don't spend it all in one place.  
		Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?

				FRANK
		We trust you, Lloyd.  You know
		that.

	Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave.

				LLOYD
		Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here...
		How's next week look for you guys?

	Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him.  
	Jack's eyes go cold.

				JACK
		We'll call you.

	As Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the
	hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool,
	then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
	because they're about to burst out laughing.



	FOLLOWING SHOT

	By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing,
	tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and
	onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the
	night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
	together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing
	under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching
	them with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a
	clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing
	their throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales
	a plume of smoke, studies them a moment,
	then smiles slightly.

				SUSIE
		Night, Bakers.

	As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her
	trim shadow disappear down the street.


	EXT.  CITY

	Gray and cold.  The streets swept with rain.  
	And once again the tentative piano:
	"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
	Oh what fun it is to ride ...
	Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."


	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room:
	small and dirty and packed with pet owners and
	their animals.
	After a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears.

				WOMAN
		Barker.
			(no takers)
		Jock Barker?

				JACK
			(realizing it's him)
		Baker.  Jack Baker.

				WOMAN
		Right.  Bring him back.

				JACK
		Come on, Ed.

	Jack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor.

				WOMAN
		You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.
		The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.

				JACK
		He doesn't bite.

				WOMAN
		They never do, Mr. Barker.

				JACK
		Baker.

				WOMAN
		Right.  In there.

	The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room.
	There is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall,
	a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats.
	Jack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie,
	who's staring up at him.

				JACK
		You shoulda brushed, pal.

	Just then, a MAN in a white coat breezes in.

				DR. BEASLEY (MAN)
		Ah, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.  
		Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.

	Dr. Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack.

				DR. BEASLEY
		Beasley.

				JACK
		Baker.

				DR. BEASLEY
		What's our friend's problem?

				JACK
		Teeth.

				DR. BEASLEY
		What's wrong with them?

				JACK
		They're falling out.

				DR. BEASLEY
		Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's
		get him up here.

	Jack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr. Beasley opens
	Eddie's mouth for a look.  It doesn't take long.

				DR. BEASLEY
		They gotta go.

				JACK
			(a take)
		How many?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Five's my guess.  Maybe more.
		Won't know till I get in there.
			(consulting his clipboard)
		Leave him now and you can pick
		him up in the morning.

				JACK
		Isn't there something you can
		give him?  A pill or something?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to
		the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.
		Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,
		would we?

				JACK
		How will he eat?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Start him out on cottage cheese.  
		If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a
		few minutes.  Go down like pudding
		through a hot pipe.

				JACK
		No bones?

				DR. BEASLEY
		No bones.

	Jack looks at Eddie.

				JACK
		What do you do to him?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out.
		He won't feel a thing.

				JACK
		I think maybe I'll bring him back
		next week ...

				DR. BEASLEY
		The sooner we do this the better,
		Mr. Baker.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone.
	He glances back at the vet's with second thought,
	then moves slowly off.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the
	refrigerator.  A carton of cream, a few eggs --
	there's not much there.  He takes a small container of
	cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an
	empty shelf.  As he closes the refrigerator door, he
	glances around the apartment.  It is very still, very
	quiet.  He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks
	over to the window and looks out.  There is a mug of
	coffee there on the sill.  He takes it and holds it in
	both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.
	He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over
	the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on
	the keys and begins to play.  "Jingle Bells."


	INT.  CORNER DINER

	In the front window, room has been made among the
	photographs for one of Susie.  Inside, Jack, Frank
	and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee
	cups and cigarettes.  Frank has several slips of paper
	before him with names and dates.

				FRANK
		The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the
		Carlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns.
		What do you think, Jack?

	Jack is staring out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jack, you with us?

				SUSIE
		The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum.
		And they water their drinks.
		It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

	Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.

				FRANK
			(watching)
		I guess it's,the Plaza then.  
		That brings us to the twenty-seventh.  
		We got the Avedon for three or the Park
		downtown for two.

				SUSIE
		We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

	Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack.  Jack shakes
	his head.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The Park?  It's only two nights.
		Why throw away a night?

				JACK
		Because Blackie Carson books the Park and
		whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

				SUSIE
		Oh.
			(lifting her glass)
		Well, for Blackie then.

				FRANK
		By the way, I got a messsage
		yesterday from some guy looking for
		New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.

				SUSIE
			(likes "resort')
		Hey.

				JACK
		Sounds like a booking agent
		looking to book an easy fee.

				FRANK
		That's what I figure.  Probably have us in
		a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

				SUSIE
		Maybe it's legit.

				FRANK
		Maybe.  I'll call him.

				JACK
		Make it collect.

				FRANK
			(shuffling his slips)
		That's it except for the first.
		We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the
		Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.

	Frank looks at Jack.

				JACK
		Draw.

	Susie shrugs.

				SUSIE
		How'd you guys used to decide what
		gig to take?

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				FRANK
		Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

				SUSIE
		So find a dime.  Let's get out
		of here.


	EXT.  DINER

	Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their
	collars up against the chill.  
	Frank pulls on a pair of gloves.

				FRANK
		Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.  
		Where're your gloves?

	Jack shrugs.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Better take care of your fingers, little brother.  
		Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't
		be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

				JACK
		I'll take my chances.

	Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street.

				FRANK
		Something, huh?  All those bids.

				JACK
		Yeah.  Something.

				FRANK
		Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

				JACK
		You wanna get a drink?

	Frank stops, surprised.

				FRANK
		No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been
		up two nights making sure the rest of us
		don't get it.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You all right?

				JACK
		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK
		Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

				JACK
		Right.

	As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,
	then disappears around the corner.  A second later,
	Susie comes out of the diner.

				SUSIE
		Where's egghead?

				JACK
		His kid's sick.

				SUSIE
			(searching her purse)
		I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two
		as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've
		scrambled the babies somewhere.


				JACK
		He takes after our mother.

				SUSIE
		Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be
		one crazy dame.  Shit.

	Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.

				SUSIE
		Uh-uh.  I never touch American
		cigarettes.
			(still searching)
		What's tomorrow again?

				JACK
		The Stratford.

				SUSIE
		Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even
		the bedspreads.
			(shaking the purse)
		Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go
		through 'em like toothpicks.
		Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,
		you believe that?

				JACK
		Huh?

				SUSIE
		Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat
		down with a pencil and added it one day.  But
		I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something
		in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.
			(finding one)
		Ah, here's a lost soul.

	Jack lights it.  She takes a draw.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well,
		au revoir.

				JACK
		Hey.
			(as she stops)
		You feel like a cup of coffee?

				SUSIE
		You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in
		there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

				JACK
		You want me to walk you?

	Susie looks at Jack a little funny.

				SUSIE
		No. Thanks.
		She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are
		you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me
		and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like
		I'm some kinda princess when I burp.

		JACK
		Forget it.

				SUSIE
		I mean, that'd be too creepy.
		With us working together and all.

				JACK
		Forget it.

				SUSIE
		Nothing personal --

	Jack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there.

				JACK
		Better hurry.  You're a nickel
		down on your cigarette.


	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his
	arms against the night's chill.  He glances up at the
	flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour
	Emergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is
	bent over a magazine.  Jack hesitates then enters.


	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

				KID
		Yeah?

	Jack glances around, ill at ease.

				KID
			(continuing)
		You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a
		bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.

	The Kid goes back to his magazine.

				JACK
		No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.
		He needed some work on his mouth.

				KID
		Regular hours are eight to five.

				JACK
		Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by.
		Thought I'd check in on him.

				KID
		You can check in on him tomorrow.  
		Between eight and five.

				JACK
		Yeah, well, couldn't I take a
		look now?

	The Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt.

				KID
		You want to know if he's okay.
		Right?

				JACK
			(uncomfortable)
		Yeah.

				KID
		All right.  Hold on.

				JACK
		The name's Baker --

				KID
		Save it.  What's he look like?

				JACK
			(puzzled)
		Black.  Labrador.

				KID
		All right. they lay the dead ones out in the
		cold room.  I'll take a look.

	The Kid disappears into the back.  Jack stands frozen,
	watching the swinging door come to rest.  He looks
	like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed
	to his neck.  He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't
	light it.  He waits.  A moment later, the door swings
	open.

				KID
		Nope.  Just a couple poodles.

	Jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.


	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	On the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing
	a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie.
	Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest.  
	In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan.

				NINA
		I tried Cheerios this morning.  
		He didn't even get up.
		Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

				JACK
		He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it,
		pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

	Jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next
	to the others.  Nina and he wait.  At first, nothing, then
	... Eddie's eyes move.  His nose twitches.  
	His head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the
	bowl.  He eats.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Chili.


	CITY

	draped in winter.  Dark skies, people lost in heavy
	coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung
	tenuously across traffic-clogged streets.  Over it all
	we hear "JINGLE BELLS," PLAYED for the first time
	completely through, hesitantly but without error.
	As the SONG ENDS, we are:


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	watching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly.
	She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch.

				JACK
			(nodding to the ceiling)
		You're gonna knock her dead, kid.


	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve.
	Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own
	little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the
	happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be
	mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable.
	Frank just looks happy. As they finish,
	the crowd applauds.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the
	lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the
	mirror, fussing with his beard.


				JACK
		Hey, Frank.

				FRANK
		You recognized me.

				JACK
		Just a lucky guess.

				FRANK
		So what do you think?

				JACK
		Very realistic.

				FRANK
			(not buying it)
		Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had
		forty pounds on me.
		Jesus, you remember him being this big?

	Jack looks in the mirror.

				JACK
		Yeah.

				FRANK
		Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.
		Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.


	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving
	a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege
	of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.

				FRANK
		You want to come out to the house tomorrow?
		The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided
		to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the
		whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can
		hardly move.  We could use another appetite.

				JACK
		Thanks, but I've got plans.

				FRANK
		All right, but if you change your mind,
		let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the
		morning anyway.

				SUSIE
			(coming up)
		Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You
		moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?

				FRANK
		For the kids.
			(moving off)
		Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't
		forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

	Frank pushes through the revolving door and steps
	out into the street in his Santa suit.

				SUSIE
		He do that every year?

				JACK
		Every year.

				SUSIE
		Aren't the kids asleep?

				JACK
		Every year.

				SUSIE
		So why's he do it?

				JACK
		I guess in case one year they're not.

	Jack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the
	door and exits.  Susie watches him go, then turns to
	the desk clerk.

				SUSIE
		Call me a cab, will ya?


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	As Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in
	the room and looks over to the old phone booth.  
	Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head
	tilted against the glass.  Jack studies her a moment,
	then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the
	kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses.  He pulls a chair
	over to the phone booth and sits down.

				NINA
		How'd the show go?

				JACK
		Okay.  How'd yours go?

				NINA
		Not so good.

	Jack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the
	soft shadows of the booth.  After a moment, her eyes
	shift to the carton in his hand.

				NINA
		Eggnog?

	Jack nods.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		From Hurley's?

				JACK
		Eighty proof. What d'ya say?
		Think you can handle it?

	Nina nods. Jack begins to fill the two glasses.

				NINA
		Jack.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				NINA
		Can I stay here tonight?  Even if
		she comes here?

	Jack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets
	it aside.

				JACK
		Sure.

		He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.

				NINA
		Merry Christmas, Jack.

				JACK
		Merry Christmas.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

	Jack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room,
	looking down at something.

				NINA
		What do you think?

	Eddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog
	sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why
	he's the object of so much attention.

				JACK
		Very cool.


	EXT. CEMETERY - JACK, NINA AND EDDIE
	(sporting his new sweater)

	make their way across an empty cemetery.
	Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.

				NINA
			(looking around)
		There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi
		down at the drugstore says it's going to snow
		by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows.
		I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman.
		You ever make a snowman, Jack?

				JACK
		Sure.

				NINA
		That's what I want to do.  
		I want to make a snowman.

	As they come to a plot of ground, they stop.  
	There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,
	fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing
	only her name.  Jack studies the plot a moment, then
	crouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.
	Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin
	and John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the
	stone, then stands.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Now?

	Jack nods.  Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours
	it onto the dead man's grave.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.

	They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.
	As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new
	sweater sniffing at a gravestone.

				JACK
		Hey, Eddie.  Have some respect,
		will ya?


	EXT.  BUILDING

	Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.
	A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and
	Jack gets in.  Susie is sitting up front.


	INT.  CAR

	Frank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent
	with family, cheerfully maneuvers the car
	through the city.

				FRANK
		So. How was everyone's Christmas?

	Jack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Too early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts
		for whoever wants them.  
		How about a maple bar, Jack?

	Jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.

	Jack stares at the back of Frank's head,
	then puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in
	the donut bag and looks a little sick.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		By the way, if anyone gets bored,
		Donna packed some travel games.
		They work wonders with the kids.

	Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack
	full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You two could play checkers.

				SUSIE
		Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

				FRANK
		Sorry.  It only plays static.

	Susie looks at the radio,
	then at the games in her hands.

				SUSIE
		How long did you say it takes to
		get to this place?


	INT. CAR - FEW HOURS LATER

	Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape,
	an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.  
	Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an
	elaborate plastic puzzle.

				FRANK
		Any more coffee?

	Susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos.

				SUSIE
		Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this?

	Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger.  Inside,
	there are hundreds of tiny entries.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You play all these places?

				FRANK
		Baker's unabridged.

				SUSIE
		Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of
		noise.  What's with the stars?

				FRANK
		Virgins.

				SUSIE
		Virgins?

				FRANK
		First times. Hey, look at this.

	A crepe-covered car surrounded by several other
	HONKING VEHICLES passes by.  Jack stares at the beaming
	newlyweds as they glide past his window,
	two kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado
	covered with toilet paper.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		When's the last time we played a
		wedding, Jack?

				JACK
		Two years ago.  March.

				SUSIE
			(consulting the ledger)
		He's right.

				FRANK
		He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

	Susie looks at Frank curiously.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Go ahead.

				SUSIE
			(scanning the book)
		Okay.The Fantasy Inn.

				FRANK
		Jack?

				JACK
			(staring out the window)
		November.  '71.

				FRANK
		First night?

				JACK
		Day.  Wednesday.

				FRANK
		Last?

				JACK
		Sunday.

				SUSIE
		I don't believe it.

				FRANK
		I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music.
		Hears it once and he's got it.

		Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		My brilliant little brother.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is
	built right on the ocean.  Frank guides the car down
	a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.

				FRANK
		Will you listen to that ocean?

	It's LOUD.  Frank takes a deep breath.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And how about this air? I'm telling you,
		a few days in this place'll put five years
		on your life.

				SUSIE
		Smells like fish.

				FRANK
		Of course it smells like fish.  
		We're on the ocean.
		What'd you expect, Chanel number five?

				SUSIE
			(to herself)
		Smells like tuna number two to me.

				FRANK
		It's paradise.  That's what it is.
		Paradise.

	As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack
	notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,
	its toilet paper streamers blowing
	gently in the ocean breeze.


	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	The lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there
	are a lot of swords on the walls.
	Franks steps up to the front desk.

				FRANK
		Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.

				CLERK
		Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific
		Tom.

				FRANK
		No. We're the entertainment.

				TOM (CLERK)
		Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?

				FRANK
		Outside.  Blue Chevy.

				TOM
			(ringing a bell)
		Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up
		to the Guinevere Suite.

	A lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles
	out for the bags.  Tom hands Frank the room keys.

				TOM
			(continuing)
		Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker.
		You can practically dangle your toes
		in the water.


	INT.  SUITE

	Tom wasn't kidding.  The immediacy of the ocean beyond
	the window is almost scary.

				FRANK
		You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting
		away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest
		of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.

	Jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed
	side by side.  Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom.

				SUSIE
		Hey, we're connected.

				FRANK
		Great.

				SUSIE
		Great?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

	Susie shrugs and returns to her room through the
	bathroom.

				JACK
		I thought we had separate rooms.

				FRANK
			(opening drawers)
		We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.
		Wash and Dries.

				JACK
		I thought we all had separate rooms.

				FRANK
		Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first
		time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when
		we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which,
	like their rooms, looks out over the ocean.  
	Dinner is over and they're well
	through a second bottle of wine.

				SUSIE
		You're kidding me.

				FRANK
		As Charlie Steinway is my witness.

				SUSIE
		Peggy Lee?

				FRANK
		Tell her.

				JACK
		She was staying at the Grand
		downtown ...

				FRANK
		It was April.  April seventeenth.
		That one I remember.

				JACK
		We were playing the lounge one
		night and she came in.

				FRANK
		Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

				JACK
		Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said
		yes, and we did a few bars.

				FRANK
		A few bars!

				SUSIE
		What'd she sing?

				FRANK
		People.' You think Streisand, right?  
		Hot that night.  Chills.  
		Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

				SUSIE
		Wow. You ever see her again?

				FRANK
		No. We got a picture, though.  
		One of the waitresses had a camera.
			(to Jack)
		God, we were just kids.  That was
		something, wasn't it?

	Jack nods.  Frank shakes his head, still lost in the
	spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds
	sitting across the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, will you look at that?

				SUSIE
		They must've bought the same
		map we did.

				FRANK
		What do you say we send a bottle
		over?

				SUSIE
		I don't believe it.  You're a
		romantic, Frank.

				JACK
		He's drunk.

				FRANK
		Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

				SUSIE
		Oh yeah?

				FRANK
		He's just afraid to show it.
		Aren't you, little brother?

				JACK
		Have some more wine, Frank.

				FRANK
		Good idea.
			(lifting his glass)
		To Peggy Lee.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Frank, standing, dressed in pajamas.
	Jack is staring out the window at the darkness.

				FRANK
		I'm putting my stuff on the right,
		okay?

				JACK
		Okay.

				FRANK
		I figure that way we won't get confused.

				JACK
		Right.

				FRANK
		Unless you want the right.

				JACK
		No, you take the right.

				FRANK
		We might as well do the towels the same way.

				JACK
		Okay.

				FRANK
		I just figure things'll go smoother, you know,
		if we have it all worked out from the beginning.

				JACK
		Good idea.

				FRANK
		But if it doesn't work out, let
		me know.  I'm,flexible.

				JACK
		Right.

	Frank nods and moves to the bed.

				JACK
			(continuing; re: the bathroom light)
		You leaving that on?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

				JACK
		All night?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

				JACK
		We're gonna be here a week?

				FRANK
			(puzzled)
		Yeah.

				JACK
		So you're gonna leave it on.
		Every night.  For a week.

				FRANK
		Yeah.  You mind?

				JACK
		Why would I mind?

				FRANK
		I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
		I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
		It was never a big deal then.  Was it?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. Well.  You want me to turn
		it off?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'll turn it off.

	Jack turns back to the window.

				JACK
		Forget it.  It's no big deal.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack and Frank are standing
	in a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands.

				FRANK
		They're beauties, huh?

	Jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.

	Frank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily.
	Jack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening.
	After a moment, Frank notices.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		What?


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	A short, stubby LITTLE MAN in a charcoal suit strides
	into the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom.

				MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)
		Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels,
		the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you
		on the phone.

				FRANK
			(offering his hand)
		That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.  
		This is my brother Jack.

	Jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.

				MR. DANIELS
		Tom here tells me there's a problem with the
		pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

				FRANK
		Yes, well, they are.

				MR. DANIELS
		Then I'm afraid I don't understand.

				FRANK
		They are in tune.  But not with
		each other.

				MR. DANIELS
		Is that important?

				FRANK
		Uh, well ...

				JACK
		Yes.  It's important.

	Frank glances nervously at Jack.

				MR. DANIELS
		Tom, who're we dealing with on
		these?

				TOM
		A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation.
		I called this morning.

				MR. DANIELS
		Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.  
		Not being a musician myself I find it difficult
		to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose
		there's any way you could just ... accommodate.

				JACK
		Accommodate?  I don't think I know
		what you mean.

				FRANK
		I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,
		Jack, is --

				JACK
		Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell
		us what he's trying to say.

				MR. DANIELS
		I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.
		I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?


	INT.  HALLWAY

	Frank dogs Jack down a hallway.

				FRANK
		Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like
		a kid.

				JACK
		No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around
		one of these assholes and you turn into a
		fucking three-year-old.

				FRANK
		What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a
		little out of tune.  So what?

				JACK
			(stopping)
		Christ, can't you hear it?

				FRANK
		No! I never hear it!
			(shaking his head)
		Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know.
		But I won't let it bother me.

				JACK
		Doesn't it matter to you?

				FRANK
		What matters to me is we've got the six easiest
		nights we've had in ten years.  
		So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.  
		So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody.
		So why should you care?

				JACK
		Because I can hear it.

				FRANK
		Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because
		come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that
		dining room with smiles on.
		Understand, little brother?


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror.
	Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the
	glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean
	goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a
	little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.

				SUSIE
		Hey, fellas.  What's the word?

	Nothing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		What's with you two?

				FRANK
		Jack woke up on the wrong side
		of the bottle.

	Susie looks at Jack.  Then Frank.

				SUSIE
		0-kay.


	INT.  LOUNGE

	As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night,"
	dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor,
	while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails.
	As the song ends, the couples applaud.

				FRANK
		Thank you, thank you.
			(as applause dies)
		You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived
		here yesterday, but already the people here at the
		King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,
		well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,
		before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part
		of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days,
		we should happen to pass one another in the hallway
		or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.
		Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here,
		there are no strangers, only friends.  
		And family.  Right, Jack?

				JACK
		Right.  I love you, Frank.

				FRANK
			(stunned)
		What?

				JACK
		I love you.  I just wanted to say it.

	Frank stares incredulously at Jack.

				FRANK
		Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.
			(moving quickly along)
		So. Susie.  How 'bout it.

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				FRANK
		Got another song for us?

				SUSIE
		Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.

				FRANK
		Well then ... shall we?


	BACKSTAGE

	Frank corners Jack as they exit the stage.
	Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching.

				FRANK
			(whispering)
		What's the matter with you?

				JACK
		I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family.
		I just got emotional.

				FRANK
		How dare you say you love me.

				JACK
		It won't happen again.  Scout's
		honor.

				SUSIE
		What's with you guys?

				FRANK
		Someone needs to grow up.  I won't
		take it, Jack.

				JACK
		Sure you will.

	Jack pushes past Frank and leaves.  
	Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Middle of the night.  Jack, fully clothed,
	is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking.
	Susie enters.

				SUSIE
		Oh, sorry.  With the light always
		on, it's hard to tell.

				JACK
		It's okay.
			(the cigarette)
		Last one.

				SUSIE
		Can't sleep?

				JACK
		In and out.

				SUSIE
		It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say.
		She was crazy for the ocean.

				JACK
		Yeah, well, I wish God would go
		a little easy on the trumpets.

				SUSIE
		How's egghead?

				JACK
		Like a baby. You?

				SUSIE
		In and out.

	Jack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		If you want, I got a pack in the
		room.

				JACK
		No thanks.  I never touch French
		cigarettes.


	INT.  LOBBY - DAY

	The next morning.  As Jack passes through the lobby,
	he hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO.  Curious,
	he goes to the dining room and peers in.  
	The tables have yet to be set for the evening and,
	except for Frank, the room is empty.

				JACK
		What the hell are you doing?

				FRANK
			(not looking up)
		What's it look like I'm doing?
		I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

				JACK
		Really.

				FRANK
		Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy,
		Jack.  If you say it's out of tune,
		it's out of tune.

	Jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.

				JACK
		How's it coming?

				FRANK
		Fine.

				JACK
		How long you been at it?

				FRANK
			(shrugging)
		Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna
		get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?

				JACK
		They stopped serving two hours ago.

				FRANK
		Two hours ago!

				JACK
		Time flies, huh?

	Frank looks despairingly at the pianos.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		I could give you a hand.  If
		you want.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	Jack and Frank are eating lunch.  Frank has a tiny
	stack of blue cards he's perusing.  
	He holds one out to Jack.

				FRANK
		What do you make that?  Paruchi?

	Jack nods.  Frank continues to go through the cards
	as he speaks.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You haven't seen Susie, have you?

				JACK
		No. Why?

				FRANK
		Just wonder what she's up to.
		I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

				JACK
		She's a big girl.

				FRANK
		Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better
		keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.
			(another card)
		Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.  
		Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?

				JACK
		What the hell are these?

				FRANK
		Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road.
		See, every morning the maids drop one of these
		cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card,
		leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play
		it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.
			(whispering)
		And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine
		o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking
		about our availability.  Like he wants to line
		something up.
		I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.

				WOMAN
		Excuse me.

	Frank jumps.  A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop
	dress pokes her head in.

				WOMAN
		I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting
		here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

				FRANK
		Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my
		brother.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)
		Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you
		play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.

				FRANK
		Oh. Well, thank you.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		No, I mean you.
			(to Jack)
		I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.
		Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry
		in your family tree, do you?

				JACK
		Afraid not.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.
		Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,
		I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn
		mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.
		Can imagine?

	Jack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
			(continuing)
		Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was
		no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.

	Florence Simmons gives a little flutter of
	a wave and exits.

				FRANK
		Funny, huh?

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		Thinking there's someone who looks like you,
		walking around the street somewhere.
			(smiling)
		Wonder if I saw him I'd think it
		was you?


	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
	hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.  
	As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices
	Florence Simmons standing a few yards away
	with a camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		I just know my sister won't believe
		me. Do you mind?

	Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
	camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		I really hate to impose.  It's just that the
		resemblance is so extraordinary.
			(focusing)
		I wonder if you could turn this way so your face
		isn't in the shadows.

	As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying
	shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
	end of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind,
	her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		Say cheese.

	The camera clicks.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
			(continuing)
		Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for
		yourself?  The hotel develops.

	Jack glances away from Susie and the man.

				JACK
		No.

	ON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
	later we --

	CUT TO:


	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	That evening.  The trio has just finished a song and
	those on the dance floor are clapping.

				FRANK
		Thank you.  You know, before we came out here
		this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking
		over your dedications and something struck us.

	Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea
	what he's talking about.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		We realized that, well, we're really not so
		different from one another after all.  Oh sure,
		we may be at different points in our journey,
		but we all travel pretty much the same road.
		And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce
		you to two very special couples.  First, married
		for all of two days, please say hello to Helen
		and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.

	Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
	couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the
	front of the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about
		Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,
		Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told
		you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?
		Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane
		have been married for seventy-five years!

	The audience lets go with an audible "ooh"
	and applauds enthusiastically.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and
		show these kids how it's done.

	A path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
	their way to the dance floor.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Aren't they a sight?

	They are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the
	dance floor than Frank anticipated.

	He nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary
	Waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage
	while they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone
	on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from
	a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the
	way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center
	of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger
	couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He
	hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a
	man's.  He puts out his cigarette in the
	sink and leaves.


	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is
	returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.
	Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to
	see a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged,
	he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.

				SUSIE
			(opening door)
		Forget your tie, handsome ...
		Frank!

				FRANK
		You want to tell me what the
		hell's going on?

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				FRANK
		I just saw a man walk out of
		your room.

				SUSIE
		Uh ...

				FRANK
		In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be
		here.  So it might be nice if you conducted
		yourself with a certain amount of decency.

				SUSIE
		Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...

				FRANK
		No. You listen.  I had my doubts
		about you from the beginning

				JACK
		Hey!

	Frank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		What're you trying to do?  Wake
		up the whole goddamn hotel?

				FRANK
		We were just having a little
		discussion about morality.

				SUSIE
		Some discussion.

				FRANK
		I just saw a man walk out of your
		room!

				JACK
		You saw wrong.

				FRANK
		Huh?

				JACK
		He's with the hotel.  I called him.

				FRANK
		What are you talking about?

				JACK
		We had a leak in the bathroom.
		He fixed it.

				FRANK
		He was wearing a suit.

				JACK
		He had to come quickly.  It was
		a big leak.

				FRANK
		How come I didn't hear anything?

				JACK
		You're a heavy sleeper, Frank.
		You've always-been a heavy sleeper.
			(looking at Susie)
		Unlike me.

	Frank looks at Jack, then Susie.

				FRANK
		I guess I ... If I jumped to...

				SUSIE
		Forget it.

	The three stand there awkwardly for a moment.

				FRANK
		Well...

	Frank shrugs lamely and exits.

				SUSIE
		Boy, he comes on like a hurricane
		in the morning, doesn't he?

	Jack just stares at her.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Yeah, well, thanks for sticking
		your head in.

				JACK
		Hey, business is business.

	He turns to leave.  Susie's eyes narrow.

				SUSIE
		It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

				JACK
		Just dinner and dance, right?


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the
	smaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.  
	The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
	ignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.  
	Then Jack.  Then out the window.

				SUSIE
		Paradise.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack and Frank's room.  It is New Year's Eve,
	just before show time, and Jack and Frank are in
	their tuxes.  Frank is on the phone.


				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Yes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the
		little glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.  
		It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything
		... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...
		Who? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy,
		okay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year.
			(waits)
		Hi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for
		Christmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't
		know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.
		Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell
		her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?
		Without the training wheels?
			(affected by this)
		Well, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait
		to see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ...
		Okay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten
		minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...

	Frank sets the phone down and stares at it.  
	Jack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly
	claps his hands.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Well, let's go.  The public waits.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mass of swarming, jubilant people.  The voices are
	high and loud and there's not a hand without a
	champagne glass.  Couples lean into one another
	intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting
	strangers without hesitation.

				FRANK
			(yelling to be heard)
		All right, everyone.  This is it.
		Let's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...

	Gradually, the entire room joins the chant.

				FRANK/EVERYONE
		Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.
		Four.  Three.  Two!  ONE!
		HAPPY NEW YEAR!

	There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
	find that certain someone to kiss in the new year.  
	In this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves
	oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,
	their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.  
	Finally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,
	then goes to Jack.  They hesitate, then kiss lightly,
	pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's
	eyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne"
	and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place
	on the stage.  As she begins to sing, the others in the
	room, all intimate friends for one brief moment,
	begin to sing with her.

				SUSIE/EVERYONE
		Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...

	As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the
	sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear
	and we see:


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack, lying on his bed in the dark.  He opens his eyes,
	squinting against the light from the bathroom, then
	glances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline
	of a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the
	side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.
	Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
	the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast
	from the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack
	stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the
	bathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and
	gently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming
	murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  
	His back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is
	shaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees
	that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and
	gathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes
	up.  He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,
	then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom.  It is
	dark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed.  It's empty.


	INT.  DINING ROOM
	Dark and soundless.  Balloons, streamers and the other
	debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.  
	Frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at
	the ocean.  As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.

				FRANK
		Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.
		Happy New Year, little brother.

				JACK
		What're you doing down here?

				FRANK
		Celebrating.  Join me?

				JACK
		The party's over.

				FRANK
		No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning.
		Come on, have a drink.  
		Show your big brother how it's done.

	Frank pours him a glass.  Jack notices the bottle.

				JACK
		Expensive hangover.

				FRANK
		A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous
		hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.
			(toasting Jack)
		We, dear brother, are a fucking
		smash.
			(nodding)
		Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they
		have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.
		Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with
		Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais
		and everyone has a grand time crawling around on
		the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a
		dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in
		a different colored shell and at the end of the
		evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job
		to separate the yolks from the whites.
		Slippery business.

	Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then
	leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.
		Not once in twelve years.

	Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.

				FRANK
		The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?
		With the blue glass.

	Jack looks up at the chandelier.

				JACK
		The Royal.

				FRANK
		Right.  The Royal.  When's the
		last time we were there?

				JACK
		Couple years.

				FRANK
		February?

				JACK
		April.

				FRANK
		Right.  It's incredible how you
		do that.  Remember things.

				JACK
		A useless talent.

				FRANK
		Drove me crazy when we were kids.
		The way you never looked at the music.
		Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

	Frank snaps his fingers.

				JACK
		They were simple songs.

				FRANK
		Not for me.  I still have to look at the music
		sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget.
		I just forget.  But you.  You never forget.
		Ever.
			(turning)
		So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

				JACK
		I told you.  It's a useless talent.

	Frank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the
	ocean.

				FRANK
		God, the old man would've loved
		this view, wouldn't he?

				JACK
		Yeah.

				FRANK
		I always think of him on New Year's.  
		How he used to pour us each half a can of beer.
		Remember?

				JACK
		You always threw up.

				FRANK
		Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.
		He loved that about you.

				JACK
		He was just having fun.

				FRANK
		It was like you'd passed some test,
		you know?

				JACK
		It was just a can of beer, Frank.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me
		anything.  Even though I was the oldest.  
		It was always you two, running off, doing things
		together.

				JACK
		You could've come.

				FRANK
		I could've.  But he didn't want
		me to.

				JACK
		You're making things up, Frank.

				FRANK
		Maybe so.
			(pause)
		You ever go back there?  Where it
		happened.

	Jack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the
	thick glass.

				JACK
		No.


	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting outside the hotel,
	watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.  
	The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal
	to the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with
	a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
	tiny souvenir shot glass.

				FRANK
		Want one?

	Jack shakes his head.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ah well, the kids'll break a
		couple anyway.

	Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the
	newlyweds are heard.

				BUD
		Give me the keys.

				HELEN
		You're not going to drive.

				BUD
		Give me the keys!

				HELEN
		You're not going to drive!

				BUD
		It's my goddamn car!

				HELEN
		It's our goddamn car!

				BUD
		Give me the keys.

				HELEN
		No.

	Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but
	she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.
	Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a
	madman, trying to catch her.  Finally, when he gets
	close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.

				FRANK
		I think I'll warm up the car.


	OVERVIEW - CITY

	Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite
	appealing after a week in paradise.


	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front
	of Jack's building.  It is very late.

				FRANK
		That takes care of this week.  The tenth we
		got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're
		at the Capri.

				JACK
		The tenth's out.

				FRANK
		What?

				JACK
		I can't make the tenth.

				FRANK
		What do you mean?

				JACK
		I mean maybe you should check with us before you
		go off and book us a month in advance.

				FRANK
		Be reasonable, Jack.

				JACK
		I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.
		How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

	Jack gets out of the car.  Frank shakes his head in
	exasperation, then looks to Susie.

				FRANK
		How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah
		this weekend?

				SUSIE
			(distracted)
		Huh?

				FRANK
		Forget it.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly.
	In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie,
	curled up on the couch, asleep.  Above them,
	hung carefully on a string, are some paper letters:
	"WELCOME HOME."


	INT.  LOUNGE

	In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
	several historical eras but which might best be described
	as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform
	"Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass
	in and out of view.

				SUSIE
		Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings
		... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...


	KITCHEN

	Jack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause.

				SUSIE
		I can't sing it anymore.

				FRANK
		What?

				SUSIE
		That song.  I can't sing it anymore.
		I'm gonna get sick.

				FRANK
		What're you talking about?  They
		love it.

				SUSIE
		I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.  
		Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

				FRANK
			(as to a child)
		Susie.  It's one more show.  One
		more time.  That's all.

				SUSIE
		And two more times tomorrow night, and two more
		times the next night, and the next night and the
		next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't
		sing that fucking song anymore!

	She's yelling.  The kitchen workers are glancing over.
	Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I need some air.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	A few minutes later.  Jack comes out of the hotel and
	sees Susie pacing.  
	He sits down and watches her for a moment.

				JACK
		You're gonna wear down those
		heels if you don't give it a rest.

		She stops.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Relax.  We'll drop the song.

				SUSIE
		Guess I got a little scattered.

				JACK
		It's a shitty  song.

	Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.

				SUSIE
		How do you do it? Every night?

				JACK
		Practice.
			(pause)
		There are worse songs, you know.
		Not many, but a few.

	Susie nods.  Jack studies her.  Something's on her
	mind.

				SUSIE
		Listen...
			(looks into his eyes)
		Nothing.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	A record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun
	goes down outside his window.  As we MOVE AWAY FROM
	the phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at
	the piano, playing along with the record,
	lost in concentration.


	EXT.  BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally
	glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be
	heard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette
	on the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others
	already there.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	The record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,
	bumping into the label.  Jack glances at the clock next
	to him and gets up.  He puts on a jacket, then takes a
	pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.


	EXT.  BUILDING

	As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,
	surprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration
	he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the
	other end of the street.  Susie starts to call after
	him, but stops.


	EXT.  JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

	The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.  
	We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.


	INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where
	a trio is playing.  He has a drink in front of him,
	but it is untouched.  After a moment, the trio finishes
	and the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to
	the applause.


				HENRY
		Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake
		things up here every so often just to keep you
		people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little
		rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit
		in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep
		his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  
		Jack Baker.

	Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  
	As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,
	not moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they
	begin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  
	Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he
	plays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.


	EXT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Later.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
	lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.

				SUSIE (O.S.)
		You were good.

	Jack stops.  Susie.

				JACK
		I can keep the beat.

				SUSIE
		Better than that.

	Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
	beginning to walk again.

				SUSIE
		What's the matter?

				JACK
		Nothing.

				SUSIE
		What'd I say?

				JACK
		Nothing.

				SUSIE
		You're upset.

				JACK
		I'm not upset.

				SUSIE
		All I said was you were good.

				JACK
			(stops)
		Look. You don't know good. All right?

				SUSIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				JACK
		It means you wouldn't know good
		if it came up and fucked you.

				SUSIE
		You were good.

				JACK
		Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

				SUSIE
		You were good.

				JACK
			(exasperated)
		How do you know?

				SUSIE
			(yelling)
		Because I saw the other people!
		And they knew you were good!
		You were good, goddamnit!

	Jack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment,
	they just stand on the corner, not talking.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So you wanna get a drink?


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

				JACK
		Nina?

				SUSIE
		Who's Nina?

				JACK
		Friend.

				SUSIE
		Friend?  What's she look like?
		Maybe I can help you find her.

				JACK
		She's four feet tall.  Ed?

				SUSIE
		Ed? How many people live here?

	Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at
	Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen.

				JACK
		I have to make him some chili.
		Okay?

				SUSIE
			(a look)
		Sure.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER

	Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic
	as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window,
	the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming.

	Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
	about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as
	if they were veils.

				SUSIE
			(at window)
		Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.  
		When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before
		the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a
		wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights
		of the city and string them into-a necklace for
		myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her
		eyes, I don't know, it was like she really
		believed it.

				JACK
		How come you didn't close your eyes?

	She looks surprised by the question.

				SUSIE
		I don't know.  I guess I didn't
		trust the night like she did.

	Susie finishes her drink and sets it down.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Let me have a cigarette, will you?  
		All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.

	Jack looks at her curiously.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Long story.

	Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You know, I saw you guys once.
		You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.

				JACK
		Must've been a cheap date.

				SUSIE
		Soap convention.

				JACK
		Soap?

				SUSIE
		Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At
		least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I
		was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The
		older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled
		the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...
			(shaking her head)
		Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you
		can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with
		him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.  
		But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with
		palms like a baby.

	Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of
		steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually
		whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.  
		Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me
		four dozen roses.
			(almost wistful)
		But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see
		the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.  
		Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to
		believe sleeping in a room like that don't change
		your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but
		the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.
			(pause)
		I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...

	Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She
	looks out the window again.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.

	She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and
	nods to the phone booth.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So what's this?

	Jack frowns, takes another drink.

				JACK
		History.

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				JACK
		My father proposed to my mother
		in there.

				SUSIE
		No kidding?

	It's a small phone booth.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The both of them?  In there?

				JACK
		He called her.

				SUSIE
		Oh. So what's it doing here?

				JACK
		Long story.

				SUSIE
		You sending me home?

	Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.

				JACK
		They'd been out dancing all night and he took
		her to the train station -- she lived over in
		Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this
		time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home,
		only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

				SUSIE
		Nervous?

				JACK
		By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's
		got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the
		rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading
		about it in the morning edition.

				SUSIE
		You're kidding.

				JACK
		He had a mind that escalated things.

				SUSIE
		So, what happened?

				JACK
		He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks
		he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks
		he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing
		you know he's got his brothers down there and
		they're tearing the thing right off the curb.

	Susie blinks.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was
		gonna try and call her.

				SUSIE
		Wow.  But I still don't see how ...

				JACK
		Ma didn't want it around.  After.

				SUSIE
		Oh.

	Jack glances out the window.

				SUSIE
			(continuing, carefully)
		Frank said you saw him die.

	Jack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Frank said ---

				JACK
		Frank wasn't 'there.

	Susie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment,
	then decides.

				JACK
		He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a
		lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean.
		He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it.
		It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd
		go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.
		To make me laugh.
			(pause)
		He drank a lot that day.

	Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo
		shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to
		do the jig.  One minute he was there ...
			(shrugs)
		I thought it was a joke at first.
		He did things like that.  Games.
			(pause)
		I was laughing when it happened.

	Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances
	up and catches Susie looking at him.

				JACK
		You got pretty eyes, you know that.


	INT.  JACK'S BEDROOM

	Jack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile,
	her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body
	falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.


	EXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,
	sleeping on the fire escape.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the
	window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one
	of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the
	doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink.

				JACK
		You gotta move 'em around if you want to
		play a song.

	Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano,
	pulls it away.

				SUSIE
		Oh. Hi.  Sorry.

				JACK
		Coffee?

				SUSIE
		Yeah... No.

				JACK
		Look, if you want to leave...

				SUSIE
		Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!

	Susie throws the cigarette out the window,
	then looks down.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Shit.  I think I started a fire.

				JACK
		If our feet get hot, you grab
		the piano.

	Susie smiles weakly.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Why don't you go.  I'll see you
		tomorrow night at the Ambassador.

	Susie doesn't move.

				SUSIE
		I followed you last night.  I
		mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was
		about to come up when you came out.

	Jack waits.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...
		I'm leaving.  The act.

	Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked
		my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat
		food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?

	Susie tries a laugh.  Jack nods.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You can always get another girl.

				JACK
			(looks out window)
		There's always another girl.


	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the
	manager.  Busboys move in and out, preparing the room
	for the evening.

				NICK
		Sick?  How sick?

				FRANK
		The flu.

				NICK
		So she's got a few sniffles.

				FRANK
		Doctor's orders.

	Nick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room.

				NICK
		You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.  
		It's unethical.

				FRANK
		Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

				NICK
		What am I gonna do?  Put a record
		player out there?
			(exiting)
		Bad, Frankie.  Bad.

				JACK
			(to Frank)
		What're you doing?

				FRANK
		Just until we find another girl.

				JACK
		Cancel, Frank.

				FRANK
		You want to know how much I got tied up in
		deposits with Willie?  We're in for three
		weeks solid, Jack.

				JACK
		Better give her pneumonia.


	INT.  BACK ROOM

	Jack and Frank find themselves in the back room of
	Willie's again.  They do not look happy.

				GIRL (O.S.)
		Remember me?

	Jack and Frank look up.  A girl in a yellow and black
	dress is in the doorway.  She looks like a bumblebee.

				GIRL
		Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time
		you guys were looking for a singer.
			(smiling)
		Perseverance.  First rule of show business.

	Jack and Frank just stare at her.

				MONICA (GIRL)
		I bought a book.  That's what it says.


	EXT.  WILLIE'S - LATER

	Frank is looking at a list.

				FRANK
		We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a
		couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me
		know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.

	Frank folds the paper carefully.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I got some calls out.  Things
		that might be good for us.

	Frank looks over at Jack for the first time.  He's
	leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		We'll try for a girl again next
		week.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.


	INT.  ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE

	Once grand, now dark and dusty looking.  A small crowd.

				FRANK
		You know, my brother and I have been playing
		together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

				JACK
		Twenty-eight years.

	No response.  Bored, brutally indifferent faces.

				FRANK
		Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little
		different.  We were just kids.  Just about the
		only one who would listen to us was the family
		cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old
		Cecil, huh, Jack?

	Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the
	microphone, is the only sound in the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing; hanging tough)
		Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in
		the Roosevelt Room, because this has always
		been ...

	Frank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and
	seat herself at a table in the back of the room.
	Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		a very special place for Jack and I.
			(recovering)
		And tonight we'd like to open with a very special
		song.  It's the song my mother and father danced 
		to the night they were married.  This is for them.


	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug.

				FRANK
		You should've told us you were coming, Ma.  
		We would've come and got you.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Spur of the moment.

				FRANK
		So what'd you think?

				MRS.  BAKER
		Thrilling.
			(glancing at Jack)
		Both of you.

				FRANK
		The audience was a little off
		tonight.

				MRS.  BAKER
		A few empty tables.  It's cozier.  
		Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place
		on a Wednesday night.

				FRANK
		I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we
		get a little midnight snack?  
		Theo's should still be open.

				MRS.  BAKER
		No, no.  You boys are tired.

				FRANK
		No, we're not.  Jack?

				JACK
		No.

				MRS.  BAKER
		I'm tired.  Really.  I should get
		home.

				FRANK
		You sure?

				MRS.  BAKER
			(nodding)
		Just call me a cab.

				FRANK
		A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half
		block down.  You wait here.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(smiling)
		All right.

	Frank dashes out of the lobby.  Jack and Mrs. Baker
	watch him go, then turn to each other.  Mrs. Baker smiles
	awkwardly, then surveys the lobby.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

	The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -
	once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation -
	look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an
	elegant dignity.

				JACK
		Yeah.


				MRS.  BAKER
		This was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On
		Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom
		upstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers.
		White tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch
		bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.

	Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room.
	After a moment, she nods toward the lounge.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		It went well tonight.

				JACK
		Frank works hard.

				MRS.  BAKER
		And you don't?

				JACK
		He leads, I follow.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Is that the way it is?

				JACK
		Pretty much.

				MRS.  BAKER
		He mentioned you had a girl for
		a while.  A singer.

				JACK
		For a while.  She left.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Yes, well, it's probably best.
		No sense bringing someone else in.

				JACK
		I suppose.

	Mrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Funny.  Watching tonight, I was
		remembering when you were young.
		How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to
		the two of you practice while I did the dishes.
			(smiling)
		My two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to
		the door and just watch.  Sometimes your father
		would too.
			(pause)
		He liked to listen to you play.
		Did you know that?

	Jack shakes his head.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		You miss him, don't you?

				JACK
		It's been a long time, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		I supposed you still have that old phone booth.

	Jack nods.  Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		His love scared me, you know.  The day he died he
		 left a flower on my pillow.

	Jack looks puzzled.  Suddenly his mother reaches out
	and very gently touches her fingers to his face.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		You look so like him.

	They stand like this for a moment, connnected, then
	Frank steps in from the street.

				FRANK
		Your limo's ready, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER
		All right.

	Mrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns
	away.  Just before she exits, she looks back.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		Good night, Jack.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.
	Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says
	a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the
	arm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat,
	then follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he
	reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.
	Not Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.  
	For a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of
	her elbow.

				JACK
		Sorry.


	INT.  CAR - NIGHT

	A few nights later.  Frank guides the car through wet
	city streets.  It's two AM and raining hard.

				JACK
		We're not getting paid then.

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
		Nothing. We get nothing.

				FRANK
		I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon.
		No one gets a cent.

				JACK
			(a pause)
		What's it for?

				FRANK
		I don't know. Some disease.

				JACK
		What disease?

				FRANK
		I don't know.

				JACK
		You don't know?

				FRANK
		It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it.
		It's not a moral decision.

				JACK
			(another pause)
		What channels it on?

				FRANK
		Seventy-one

				JACK
		Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?

				FRANK
			(defensive)
		A channel.  
		It's just a little further down the dial, that's all.
		Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

	Jack stares at Frank.

				JACK
		Right.


	INT.  HALLWAY

	Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway.

				FRANK
		The guy said to find Studio E and
		turn right.  What's that say?

	Suddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through
	the corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge
	YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.

				YOUTH
		Fast break!

	Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it
	around the corner.

				FRANK
		I guess it's that way.


	INT.  STUDIO

	Jerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil
	and crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the "phone
	bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,
	in makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board,
	set on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,
	at 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid
	in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the
	camera.

				FRANK
		This must be it.  I'll see when
		we're on.

	Frank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's
	walked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset
	MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the
	sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.

				EARL (MAN)
		You the magician?

				JACK
		No.

				EARL
			(disappointed)
		Oh.  What do you do?

	Jack points to the pianos across the room.

				JACK
		Piano.

				EARL
			(hopeful)
		Two at a time?

				JACK
		My brother and I. One each.

				EARL
			(disappointed again)
		Oh.

				JACK
			(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)
		What's wrong with the kid?


				EARL
		Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right
		before the accident.

				JACK
		Accident?

				EARL
		The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to
		buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

		As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank
		returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

				FRANK
		We're on after Meadowlark.
			(seeing Jack's face)
		What's wrong?

				JACK
		Are you kidding me?  Are you
		fucking kidding me?

				FRANK
		What?

				JACK
		We're playing for a goddamn
		gymnasium!

				FRANK
			(worried)
		What?

	Before Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the
	wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux
	strides in front of the camera.  He's VINCE NANCY,
	the host.

				VINCE
		Let's hear it for our own Jimmy
		Marshall, shall we?

	The audience applauds.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist
		on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant
		High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us
		Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...
		if there is a next season.
			(Uncle Sam)
		That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.  
		Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the
		streets and in the gym where they belong.

	Applause.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about
		our next guest?
			(consulting a card)
		He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with
		us two of the most respected men in the musical
		entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me
		when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I
		say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker
		Boys!  Come on out here guys.

	Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and
	Frank enter from the right.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice
		suits, fellas.
			(to camera)
		Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out
		there are going to want to rap with these guys and
		don't worry.  Right after they finish up here,
		they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we
		can even convince them to raffle off a few piano
		lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?

	The audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Well, all right then.  What are we
		waiting for?  Take it away, guys.

	Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and
	begin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes
	very quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank
	are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously
	LOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out
	again.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's
		time to turn the board over.
			(to Jack, Frank)
		I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.  
		Let's bring out the board.

	Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board
	right in front of Jack and Frank.  
	Jack looks positively homicidal.

				FRANK
		Jack ...

	Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.  
	Then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the
	basketball and fires it at Vince.

				VINCE
		What the --

				JACK
			(pointing)
		You're a fucking creep, you know
		that.  I oughta kick your ass.

				FRANK
			(whispering)
		Jack, you're on television.

				JACK
		Shut up, Frank.

	Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on
	Jack's shoulder.

				EARL
		What do you say we go for a walk,
		pal.

				JACK
		Get your hand off me.

				EARL
		Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you.  
		Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget
		what you're angry about.

				JACK
		Go fuck yourself.

				EARL
			(eyes go hard)
		You're a real tough guy when the
		ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

				JACK
		I don't see any ladies here.
		Except maybe you.

	That does it.  Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and
	starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door.

				FRANK
		Hey, leave him alone.

				EARL
		Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.

				JACK
		You're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't
		you know the man's supposed to lead?

	Earl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard.  
	Jack stumbles back against the wall.

				EARL
		Who do you think you are, asshole?
		Liberace?


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.  
	Frank follows a few yards behind.

				FRANK
		Jack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a
		tuxedo.  Three hundred dollars.
			(pause)
		You gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous
		silent act?  Look, it was for publicity.  
		Do you understand?  Publicity.

	Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.

				JACK
		What-are you?  A fucking moron?
		It's three o'clock in the morning,
		Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?
		Maybe you can get us a gig playing
		Little Frank's birthday party.
		What do you think?

				FRANK
		Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on
		until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?  
		I had the pianos anyway.

				JACK
		Basketballs, Frank.  You had us
		playing for basketballs.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed
		up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle
		of a gig.

				JACK
			(incredulous)
		What?

				FRANK
		It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.  
		A stupid-ass stunt.

	Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.

				JACK
		What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing
		ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let
		that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were
		always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.  
		What's happened to your dignity?

				FRANK
		Dignity?  Who the hell are you to
		talk about dignity?

	Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's
	jacket, coming away with a bottle.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		This where you get your dignity, Jack?  
		This is where you get your courage?

	Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		No, let's do it straight for
		once, shall we?

	Frank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it
	SHATTERS.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Let me explain something to you, little brother.  
		See, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got
		a wife and two children who expect to wake up every
		morning with food on the table and heat in the house.  
		I got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's
		medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  
		Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so
		fucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't
		you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes
		and blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  
		But I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little
		brother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out
		in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go
		on living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,
		but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I
		folded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,
		little brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.

	Jack stares at Frank through the rain,
	then turns and begins to walk away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Great.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,
		Jack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another
		bottle of courage on your way home.
			(pause)
		That's what he'd do.

	Jack stops, his back to Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You've found the perfect solution to all the
		pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?  
		Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or
		night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.  
		You're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.

	Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.

				JACK
		Stay off it.

				FRANK
		No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of
		watching you make him up into some kinda god.  
		For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid
		bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He
		wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.

				JACK
			(eerily cold)
		You weren't there.

				FRANK
		That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the
		luxury of being a witness to tragedy.

				JACK
			(coiled)
		Fuck you.

				FRANK
		No, fuck you.  And fuck him too.
		Fuck the both-of you.

	Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the
	lapels.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, what're you doing?  Hey!

	Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling
	and slamming him in a fitful rage.

				FRANK
			(continuing; scared)
		Jack! ... Jack! ...

	Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect
	himself.  Jack hovers over him.

				JACK
		How's it feel to have your little brother beat
		the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!

	Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.  
	Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,
	and catches a blow on his fingers.

				FRANK
		My hands!  My hands!

	Jack grabs one of Frank's hands.

				JACK
			(mocking)
		Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue
		ribbon on amateur night.

	Jack bends back Frank's fingers.

				FRANK
			(terrified)
		Jack!

				JACK
		Who's weak now, big brother?

	Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.

				FRANK
		Jack!  JACK!

	Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  
	Suddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still
	clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior
	as Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks
	at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped
	and dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split
	and bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks
	hollow, frightened.

				JACK
		I'm through with it.  I can't do
		it anymore.

	Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack
	just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and
	disappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive
	solo piano.  And we see:


	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain
	over now.

	Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the
	dim glow of the streetlights.

	Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing
	there.  Alone.

	Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off
	the engine.

	Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.

	Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as
	the sun begins to come up.

	Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill,
	watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone
	across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes
	to the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.  
	It rings.  Again.  Again.

				CINDY (V.0.)
		Hello?

	Jack blinks.  It's Cindy.

				CINDY
		Hello ... Hellooooo ...
			(fainter)
		Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the
		phone and they won't talk.

	Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle.


	INT.  BAR

	Jack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the
	light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.  
	A big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
	talking to Jack.

				MAN
		If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.  
		If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.  
		If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.  
		That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I
		send you home.  Okay?

	Jack nods and points to the piano in the corner.

				JACK
		That it?

				MAN
		How many you need?

	Jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.

				JACK
		It's out of tune.

				MAN
		Trust me, the way I fix a martini,
		it'll be in tune.

	The MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	Frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother
	and sister tandem who would be better served by an
	obedience school.  While the little girl pounds
	incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles
	around the room, destroying everything in sight.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


	EXT.  STREET
	Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner
	where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


	INT.  BAR

	Jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing
	throughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight
	and the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain
	at the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers.  
	As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.  
	There is a glass on the piano with money in it.

				SUSIE (O.S.)
		I thought the Bakers didn't take
		tips.

	Jack glances up, but he knows the voice.

				JACK
		I give it all to charity.

	Susie nods.

				SUSIE
		Saw the sign outside.  Got your
		own sign, huh?

				JACK
		Yeah.  Got my own sign.

				SUSIE
		So ... ?

				JACK
		We outgrew each other.

				SUSIE
		Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't
		figure.  You two.

				JACK
		You don't pick your brother.

				SUSIE
		Yeah.

				JACK
		So how's the cat food business?

				SUSIE
		Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.

	Jack nods.

				JACK
		What kind?

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				JACK
		Vegetables.

				SUSIE
		Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of
		the important ones.

	Susie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new
		place.  Or we could go to a bar ...
			(looking around)
		Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know
		a place uptown, if you want --

				JACK
		I've given it up.

	Susie stops.

				SUSIE
		No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a
		reunion over tomato juice, can you?
			(pause)
		Anyway, if you're ever in the
		neighborhood ... I wrote it down.

	Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands
	it to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Tell egghead I said hi.  If you
		see him.

				JACK
		If I see him.

	Susie nods and walks toward the door.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Hey.
			(as she stops)
		You got pretty eyes.

	Susie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip
	of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  
	He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's
	wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.


	INT.  FRANK'S DEN

	Frank sits alone in the darkness of the den.  The
	cardboard stand-up is there, along with several old
	photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in
	tuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee.  After a moment,
	Donna enters.

				DONNA
		Frank?  It's late, honey.

	Frank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Mrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make
		his lesson tomorrow.

	Donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the
	photograph in his hand.

				FRANK
		You know how good he is?  It's like breathing
		with him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,
		looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.  
		Maybe it's worse.  For him.
			(gesturing to the piano)
		It's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.  
		But when I was up there with him...
		It was like I had the gift, too.


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY

	Frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning
	against the bathroom door.  It's locked.

				FRANK
		Come on, Jeremy.  Open the door.

	Somewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.  
	Frank ignores it.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jeremy.  You want me to call your father?  
		He's not going to be very happy when he hears
		he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you
		to sit on the toilet.

	Donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.

				DONNA
		Honey ...

				FRANK
		You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm
		playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next
		thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.  
		There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

				DONNA
		Honey ...

				FRANK
		Where are our kids?  
		Has he got one of them in there?

				DONNA
		Frank.

	Frank finally looks at his wife.  She's crying.


	INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the
	nurses station.  As he moves to the counter, Donna
	appears.

				JACK
		Donna.  Where is she?

	Donna just shakes her head.

				DONNA
		We tried the apartment, but after
		that we didn't know where to call.

	Jack looks frozen.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Frank'll be back in a moment.  
		He took Little Frank to the bathroom.

	Jack begins to back away slowly.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Jack ...

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in
	and out of shadows.  Finally he stops inside a closed
	storefront, his back up against the window, and looks
	down at his hands.  They're shaking.


	INT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY

	Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.  
	After a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.

				SUSIE
		Jack.

				JACK
		Hi.

				SUSIE
		Well, this is some surprise.
			(seeing his face)
		Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.

	Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Jack?

	Jack looks up.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You want to come in?

	He nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Let me get the light.

				JACK
		No.

	He stares directly into her eyes.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Leave it dark.


	INT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down
	at Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her
	face as if looking for something, then takes his coat
	and begins to leave.

				SUSIE
		I used to do that.

	Jack turns.  Susie is looking at him.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could
		wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on
		the other end of it, though.

				JACK
		I didn't want to wake you.

				SUSIE
			(smiling slightly)
		Yeah.

				JACK
		Thanks.  For letting me in last night.

				SUSIE
		Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.  
		Like a song.

	Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and
	turns for the door.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey.

	Jack stops, his hand on the doorknob.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Am I gonna see you again?

	Jack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.

				JACK
		Yeah.  You're gonna see me again.

	Susie smiles slightly.

				SUSIE
		Okay.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack is standing across the street from his mother's
	house, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the
	street.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of
	the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,
	kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
	cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the
	damage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his
	fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks
	toward the house.


	EXT.  HOUSE

	Through the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING
	sound and see partially into the front door.  Half
	the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.  
	He opens the door and enters.


	INT.  HOUSE

	Inside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a
	completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.  
	Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely
	into shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of
	ghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the
	kitchen.


	INT.  KITCHEN

	As Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching
	through a cabinet.  He watches for a moment.

				JACK
		What're you looking for?

	Frank turns quickly, surprised.

				FRANK
		I didn't hear you come in.

				JACK
		What're you doing?

				FRANK
	Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But
	it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of
	cooking sherry.

	Jack nods.  Frank looks nervous.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd
		want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.  
		If you want to get started.

				JACK
		Later.

	Frank nods.  Silence.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.

				FRANK
		Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.  
		She and Dad had taken care of it.

				JACK
		Right.

				FRANK
		I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're
		doing the stone today.
			(pause)
		It's okay?  Wednesday?

				JACK
		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK
		There's not going to be a viewing.
		I figured with the kids and all ...

				JACK
		Sure.

	Jack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls.  
	Handmade curtains, lightly faded.

				FRANK
		It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the
		house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep
		up with it. I keep losing my wind.

	Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a
	moment.

				FRANK
			(continuing;glancing away)
		God, I could use a drink.

	Jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.

	Frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Damn.  Donna must've packed
		them up this morning.

	Jack holds out the bottle.

				JACK
		Go ahead.

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
			(showing the seal is unbroken)
		Bought it on the way over.  Clean
		as a nun.

				FRANK
		No, it's not that.  I ... can't
		drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

				JACK
		Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.

	Frank looks embarrassed.

				FRANK
			(remembering)
		Oh, hey, I want to show you
		something.  Come on.

	Jack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank
	stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
	gestures Jack to the other.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hit the C. Go ahead.

	Jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank
	does the same.  Jack glances up in surprise.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'm right, aren't I? They're
		in tune.

	Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		All these years.  She kept them in tune.  
		Can you imagine?  
		Now why would she do something like that?

	Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  
	Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
	glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a
	different hotel.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have
		that drink after all.
			(picking up a few glasses)
		What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  
		We got the Travelodge on Route 41.  
		And ... the Mallory.

				JACK
		I'll take the Mallory.

				FRANK
		Good choice.

	Frank blows some dust off the glasses.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Looks like these got a few years on them.

				JACK
		This'll kill 'em.

	Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano
	benches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.

				FRANK
		Jesus.

	It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old
	familiar place, staring into his glass.

				JACK
		How're your hands?

				FRANK
			(surprised)
		Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple
		sore knuckles.  Nothing.

				JACK
		You know, that night, I ... It
		just all came up.

				FRANK
		Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

				JACK
		I mean, you can play.  You're
		okay.

				FRANK
			(smiling)
		I can keep the beat.

	Jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Charlie called.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				FRANK
		Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  
		Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.  
		Nothing like a little absence to make the heart
		grow fonder, huh?

				JACK
		Yeah.

	Jack and Frank lock eyes again.  
	Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass.

				FRANK
		Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?

				JACK
		Five years ago.
			(thinking)
		November.

				FRANK
		Right.  It was someone's birthday.
		Halloran?

				JACK
		Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.

				FRANK
		Christ, that's right.  How could
		I forget.  What a nightmare.

				JACK
		She asked for it.

				FRANK
		I told Halloran we didn't do
		vocals, but he said:

				JACK AND FRANK
			(in unison)
		What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.

				JACK
		She got it all right.

	Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy
	mischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel
	on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen."

				JACK AND FRANK
			(singing)
		She comes on like a dream
		Peaches and cream
		Lips like strawberry wine
		She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.
		Ribbons and curls
		Ooh, what a girl
		Eyes that sparkle and shine
		You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

	As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a
	moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  
	Full of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before
	him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is
	quiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.

				FRANK
		Well ... One more time?

	Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass
	held out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.

				JACK
		One more time.

	"THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS"


	FADE IN:

	JACK BAKER

	is standing before a dirty window, looking
	out at a dirty city street.  He is wearing a tuxedo.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey.

	WIDEN ANGLE

	It's the GIRL from this afternoon.

				JACK
		Hey.

	Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the
	bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment.  
	Not good.

				GIRL
		Whatcha doin' over there?

				JACK
		Gotta go.

				GIRL
		How come?

				JACK
		Job.

	The Girl glances at the bedside clock.

				GIRL
		Funny hours.

				JACK
		Funny job.

				GIRL
		Will I see you again?

	Jack looks out at the dirty street again.

				JACK
		No.

	The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.

				GIRL
			(at the tux)
		You weren't wearing that, were
		you? Earlier.

	Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on
	the sill.

				JACK
		Brought it.

				GIRL
		Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

				JACK
		Thanks.

				GIRL
		I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone
		who wore that shit.

	Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to
	the door.

				GIRL
			(continuing)
		Hey.
			(as he stops)
		You got great hands.


	EXT.  STREET - JACK

	Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
	a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
	the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
	all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
	he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
	goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  
	Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
	the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.

				DOORMAN
		Hey, Jackie!

				JACK
		How goes it, Tommy?

				TOMMY (DOORMAN)
			(shrugging)
		Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?

				JACK
		Losing his teeth.

				TOMMY
		No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.
		I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust
		the taps.

				JACK
		Yeah.
			(standing back)
		Jesus, you look like fucking
		royalty, Tommy.

	Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.

				TOMMY
		Yeah.  The big boys sent it down
		yesterday.

				JACK
		Another five years, huh?

				TOMMY
		Like clockwork.  You got a good
		memory, Jackie.

				JACK
		It ain't always a blessing.  My
		brother here?

				TOMMY
			(nodding)
		He's got blood in his eye.

	Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and
	moves into the hotel.


	INT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK

	Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the
	lounge when he sees Jack approaching.

				FRANK
		Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could
		make it.

				JACK
		How we doing?

				FRANK
		How we ... ? What, are you kidding
		me?

				JACK
		Am I late?

				FRANK
		That's not the point.

				JACK
			(taking out a cigarette)
		What's the point?

				FRANK
		You cannot continue to walk in at
		the last moment, Jack.

				JACK
		You want me to show up late a few
		nights?

				FRANK
		Jack.

				JACK
		Frank.

				FRANK
		Jack.

				JACK
		Frank.  I'm here.  I always get
		here.  Don't sweat it.

				FRANK
		Christ, will you look at your hair?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny
	tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.

				JACK
		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK
		You look like you just crawled out
		of bed.

				JACK
		No one's gonna be looking at my
		hair.  Come on, we're on.

	Frank just stands there, bottled up with
	exasperation.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your
		tie starts to spin.


	Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his
	head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard
	stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
	of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,
	this: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
	Fabulous Baker Boys!"

	BAKER BROTHERS

	as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
	and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent
	that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a
	poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.

	WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE

	As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables
	of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
	daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.
	After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and
	the couples applaud.

				FRANK
			(Mr.  Smile)
		Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome
		to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker
		and eighty-eight keys across from me is my
		little brother, Jack.

	Applause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes
	a draw on his cigarette.

				FRANK
			(continuing; could do this in his sleep)
		You know, my brother and I have been playing
		together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it
		been, Jack?

				JACK
		Twenty-eight years, Frank.

	Applause.

				FRANK
		That's a lot of water under the
		bridge, eh, Jack?

				JACK
		Lotta water.

				FRANK
		Of course, back then, things were a little
		different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just
		about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie
		Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would
		listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.
			(to Jack)
		We must have shaved three lives off that cat,
		eh, Jack?

	Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of
	razor blades.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since
		Jack and I first stepped on the stage as
		professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,
		and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...
		well, believe me, we've seen our share of this
		crazy country of ours.  But even though we've
		played some of the finest venues in the world ...

	At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		... There's one place that's always been, for us,
		a very special place, and that place is... this
		place, the Starfire lounge.

	Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's
		the ...
			(pregnant moment)
		... people.

	At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard
	and give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.'


	JACK AND FRANK - LATER
	They exit the stage to applause.


				FRANK
		Thank you.  Remember, room service is available
	till one A.M. for you late-nighters.


	INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

	Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.

				FRANK
		Don't make trouble, all right?

				JACK
		Who's gonna make trouble?
			(spotting someone)
		Hey, amigo!


	JACK'S POV - MAN

	in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,
	looks up.

	BACK TO SCENE

				MAN
		Jack!
			(lower)
		Frank.

				FRANK
			(the feeling's mutual)
		Yeah, hi, Hector.

				HECTOR (MAN)
			(re: the soup bone)
		For Eddie.  I wrap.

				JACK
		Gracias.

				FRANK
			(as they exit)
		I mean it, Jack.  Behave.

				JACK
		Like an angel.


	INT.  OFFICE

	Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,
	despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal
	attitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays
	in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture
	any further is to risk contracting some hideous
	disease.

				LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)
			(preparing a cash envelope)
		Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.

				FRANK
		Thanks, Lloyd.

				LLOYD
		Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night
		like this.

				FRANK
		Uh ... thanks.

	Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left
	him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.

				LLOYD
		Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you
		wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go
		play with the niggers on State Street.  These
		blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some
		guy dripping ash all over himself while he's
		playing 'The Sound of Music.'

	ANGLE - JACK

	Smoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,
	like a pit bull eyeing a steak.

	BACK TO SCENE

				LLOYD
		Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more
	lessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.

	Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,
	business closed, busies himself with other matters.

				FRANK
		Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us
	back, do you, Lloyd?

				LLOYD
		I'll call you.

				FRANK
		Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I
	thought maybe...

				LLOYD
		I'll call you.

	Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.

				JACK
		Count it.

				FRANK
		Huh?

				JACK
		Count it.

				FRANK
		Jack...

				JACK
		Count the fucking money, Frank.

	Lloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him.
	Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.

				FRANK
		It's all here.
			(pulling Jack out)
		I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

	Lloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling
	with amusement.


	EXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK

	Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
	soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard
	stand-up under his arm.

				FRANK
		You mind telling me what that was about in there?
		Was that planned?  
		Or were you just bored and decided
		to get creative?

				JACK
		Fuck him.

				FRANK
		This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on
		Route 81, Jack.

				JACK
		Fuck him.

				FRANK
			(to himself)
		Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.

	The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
	Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
	the stand-up away.

				JACK
		So we on tomorrow night?

				FRANK
			(shaking his head)
		Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the
		Sheraton's got appendicitis.

	Jack nods and starts to walk away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey.

	Jack stops.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Listen ... why don't you come out to the house
		this weekend.  Say hello to the kids.  
		They've grown.

				JACK
		I hate your kids, Frank.

				FRANK
		You're their uncle.

				JACK
		Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

				FRANK
		They don't.  They're always asking about you.

				JACK
		They tried to electrocute me, Frank.

				FRANK
		It was an accident.

				JACK
		It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little
		one ...

				FRANK
		Cindy.

				JACK
		She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.  
		How do you explain that?

				FRANK
		She didn't know what she was doing.
		You're too sensitive.

				JACK
		You got weird kids, Frank.

				FRANK
		Look, I just thought if you came out you might
		see what you're missing.

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Just think about it, all right?
		Consider it a standing offer.

	Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.

				FRANK
			(continuing;like a litany)
		You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,
		I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.
		Good night, Frank.

	Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.
	Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance,
	then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
	for home.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING

	Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
	building, where a black labrador is studying him from
	a second story window.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
	cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone
	booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,
	EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not
	an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
	face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.

				JACK
		Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the
		apartment.

	Eddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper
	and hands it over.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular
		Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth
		around here.

	Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
	to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  
	He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
	MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the
	tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
	walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling
	back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
	gently on the keys and stares out the open window,
	listening to the music.


	INT.  PIANO STORE

	Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano
	showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.
	WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap
	upright, contemplating his shoes.

				FRANK
		What happened to the two Clays, Willie?

				WILLIE
		Out.

				FRANK
		When they coming in?

				WILLIE
		Wednesday next.
		Frank looks across the room at Jack.


				FRANK
		What d'ya got?,

				JACK
		Bosen black.
			(taps a key)
		Flat.

				FRANK
		What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?

				WILLIE
		What's the gig?

				FRANK
		Two nights.

	Willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.
	Frank frowns and glances around.
	Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		What d'ya got?

				JACK
			(tapping)
		Yamaha white.  Nice.

	Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
	his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.

				FRANK
		What do you think?

				JACK
		Try the black Knable.

	Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process,
	watching Jack for a verdict.
	After a moment, Jack nods.

				FRANK
		Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,
		Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.

				WILLIE
		My pleasure.


	INT.  DINER

	The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,
	Jack nursing an ice coffee,
	Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  
	The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
	of neighborhood luminaries,
	including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.

				FRANK
		You know, I think it's been five years since I
		saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.

				JACK
		Trust me, you're not missing anything.

				FRANK
		You look awful.

				JACK
		Thanks.

				FRANK
		Really.  You sleeping?

				JACK
		Only on odd days.

				FRANK
			(a look)
		Seeing anyone in particular?

				JACK
		Why the interest?

				FRANK
		Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about
		you. Because sometimes it seems like the most
		significant relationship in your life is with
		that goddamn dog of yours.

	Jack studies his brother's face.

				JACK
		I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.

				FRANK
		What about that waitress at the Ambassador?

				JACK
		Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?

				FRANK
		Funny.
			(points at his wedding band)
		Strike a bell?

				JACK
		It's only a ring.  Not a collar.

				FRANK
		It's more than that.

	Jack smiles and sips his coffee.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.

				JACK
		No thanks.

				FRANK
		No, I mean it.

				JACK
		So do I.

				FRANK
		We gotta go, Jack.

				JACK
		No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up
		there every couple weeks you feel guilty.  
		I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

				FRANK
		This time you gotta go.

				JACK
		I don't gotta go.

				FRANK
		You gotta go.

				JACK
		Says who?

				FRANK
		Your older brother.

				JACK
		You're thirteen months older than me, Frank.
		That might've meant something in the Apache
		clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.

				FRANK
		Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.

	Jack glances up.  Frank nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		So what do you say?
		Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?

	Jack squints out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Okay.  And don't worry about a present.
		I got her something from both of us.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,
	gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street
	on which he grew up.

				FRANK
		Make sure you lock.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
	three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth
	of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.
	But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.

	BACK TO SCENE

				FRANK
		Place looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to
		mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.  
		Times've changed, huh?
			(pointing)
		See the tree?
		Remember the job Cecil did on it the day
		Dad planted it?
		You can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.
		I was looking at it just the other day.
		Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.

	Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,
	then raps on the front door.
	Jack studies the tree a moment,
	then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.

				JACK
		So what'd we get her?

				FRANK
		You'll see.

	ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

	At that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
	is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.

				MRS. BAKER
		Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!

				FRANK
		How's the birthday girl?

				MRS. BAKER
		A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.

	Mrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,
	embraces Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
			(continuing)
		John.  It's good to see you.

				JACK
			(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)
		Good to see you, Ma.

	Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and
	mimics "John" with a knowing nod.

				FRANK
		Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.
		Jack. He goes by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
		I thought maybe held gotten over that.

				FRANK
		Twenty years, Ma ...

				MRS. BAKER
		Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.
		Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
		we had a pig on the farm named Jack.
		I guess I just can't help making the association.

	Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
	holds his brother personally responsible for this.

				FRANK
		Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,
		John Kennedy went by Jack.

				MRS. BAKER
		Catholics.  What do you expect?  
		Oh, well, what's in a name, right?
		Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.

	As Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.

				FRANK
		Keep her busy, will ya?
		I have to set a few things up.

	Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch
	with the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head,
	wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,
	then enters the house.

	INT.  HOUSE

	The front room is cluttered with his childhood.  
	Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
	perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed
	with age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,
	are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.
	Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,
	piled everywhere in drunken stacks.
	This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,
	warily, but with a noticeable dispassion,
	until his eyes fall upon a photograph.
	In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man
	in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.

	Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,
	perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,
	his shirt too big, is caught in profile,
	looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(entering)
		Well, now, where's everyone run off to?
		Frank?

				JACK
		Downstairs.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh.

	All at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.

				MRS. BAKER
		Well, shall we cut that cake?

	Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen.
	He places the box on the table and stands off to the
	side while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.

				MRS. BAKER
		So. How are you?

				JACK
		Fine.  You?

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh, fine.

	Silence.
	Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.
	Her fingers are trembling.

				MRS. BAKER
			(continuing)
		Big piece or little?

				JACK
		Huh? Oh, no.

				MRS. BAKER
		None?

				JACK
		I'm not much for sweets.

	Mrs. Baker nods.


				MRS. BAKER
		How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?

				JACK
		Eddie.

				MRS. BAKER
		Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?

				JACK
		He's losing his teeth.

	Mrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.
	Suddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.

				MRS. BAKER
		Sounds like your brothers back with us.


	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

	Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
	old movie projector and a roll-up screen.

				MRS. BAKER
			(entering)
		What's all this?

	Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
	tiny ribboned box.

				FRANK
		Go on.

	Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker
	pulls the ribbon off the box.  
	Inside is a tiny spool of film.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Why, what's this?


	INT.  KITCHEN (LATER)

	Blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.  
	Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.  
	Mrs. Baker close on his elbow,
	sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.  
	Jack sits off to the side.  
	A title card appears:
	"For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible."
	Mrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.  
	He just smiles.

	Suddenly, images spring to the screen,
	obviously footage several years old,
	showing Jack and Frank as children,
	sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,
	smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh my God ...

				FRANK
		Recognize these two characters?

				MRS. BAKER
		I thought these were lost.  
		Where did you find ...

				FRANK
		In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.
			(pointing with his fork)
		Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.

	As Frank's laughter fills the dark room,
	Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen.  
	Suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,
	in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.

				MRS. BAKER
			(laughing)
		Oh no!

				FRANK
		I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
		all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't
		fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?

	Jack says nothing.

				MRS. BAKER
		Oh, look at you two.  So skinny.
		And those tiny suits ...

				FRANK
		Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.

	Jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year
	and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.  
	He is so tall his face cannot be seen.  
	As he dances quickly out of sight,
	he ruffles Jack's hair.

				MRS. BAKER
		That man.

	As the film jumps again,
	Jack glances at the photograph to his right.
	The images on the screen flicker softly off
	the glass of the picture frame.

				MRS.  BAKER (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Oh, look how you're growing.
		My little boys ...

	Jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother
	and brother, sitting close together in the love seat,
	laughing.  After a moment, their voices fade and Jack
	looks back to the children on the screen,
	like two tiny men, mirror images of one another.
	At first the changes are subtle.  
	Little Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.
	But as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one
	another less and less, until finally,
	the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in
	his place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in
	rumpled coat and open collar,
	a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  
	A woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the
	offending cigarette away in a flash.


	INT.  CAR

	Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.
	Whispers of steam snake from the
	mancovers in the street.

				JACK
		I made her nervous.

				FRANK
		What do you mean?

				JACK
		Her hands.  Like that.

	Jack holds out a trembling hand.

				FRANK
		Nah.  Medication.

	Jack looks over at Frank.  He nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Couple years, now.
			(taps his heart)
		Keeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.

	Jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.

				FRANK
		She was glad to see you.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops.
	Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.
	Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
	the bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin,
	he pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.


	EXT.  STREET - DAWN

	The next morning.  Early.  
	The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
	beginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly,
	RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"
	-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,
	over and over.


	IHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering
	Eddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room,
	seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.
	She stops playing and turns.

				NINA
		Morning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.

	Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.
	He nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.

	Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.


				NINA
			(continuing)
		Did you break a cup, Jack?

				JACK
		Eddie did.

	Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,
	then brings Jack his coffee with both hands.

				NINA
		I practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.
		I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'

	Jack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.
	Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Guess they're up.

				JACK
		Sounds big.  What's he do?

				NINA
		Process server.
		Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours
		are more regular.  All I know's he came to take
		the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
		dinner.  And breakfast.

				JACK
		What happened to the donut king?

				NINA
		Married.

	Upstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
	stairwell. Nina peers out the window.

				NINA
		No breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.

	TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Well, gotta go.  Teach me later?

	Jack nods.
	Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
	Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.

				JACK
		Hey.


	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses
	of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence
	seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,
	giving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment.  
	Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't
	fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause
	is less than volcanic.

				FRANK
		Uh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this
		evening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed
		yourselves as much as we did.

	As the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,
	a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.

				BELLHOP
		Mr. Baker.

				FRANK
			(tired)
		Yeah, Jimmy.

				JIMMY (BELLHOP)
		Mr. Simpson asked to see you.

				FRANK
		All right, tell him I'll be right there.

	As Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'


	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR

		Frank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."
		It's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,
		a heavy man in a shiny suit,
		is throwing darts in the general direction of a
		dartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.

				CHARLIE
		Frankie.

				FRANK
		You wanted to see me, Charlie?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, come on in.

				FRANK
		Little slow tonight.

				CHARLIE
			(waving it off)
		Mondays.

	Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it
	to Frank.

				FRANK
		What's this?

				CHARLIE
		Your pay.

				FRANK
		Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.

				CHARLIE
		Take it now.

				FRANK
			(confused)
		What about tomorrow?

				CHARLIE
		We don't need you, Frankie.

	For a moment, Frank just stands there.

				FRANK
		I've got the grands for two nights,
		Charlie.  You can't just --

				CHARLIE
		It's all there.  Both nights.

	Frank looks at the envelope in his hands.


				FRANK
		What're you saying, Charlie?

				CHARLIE
		Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been
		playing here, a long time.

				FRANK
		Twelve years.

				CHARLIE
		Right, twelve years.  Couple times
		a month.

				FRANK
		So?

				CHARLIE
		So maybe it's time we took a vacation from
		each other.

				FRANK
		Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.
		You said so yourself.

				CHARLIE
		It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.
		I got six waiters standing in back listening
		to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor.  
		To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.  
		It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.
		I love both you guys, you know that.  
		You're class.  But people today.  
		They don't know class if it walks up and
		grabs 'em by the balls.


	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with
	the cardboard stand-up.

				JACK
		What's with Charlie?

				FRANK
		Nothing.  Everything's great.
		Terrific.


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	With the stand-up under his arm,
	Frank enters and closes the door quietly.  
	A light is glowing in the kitchen.  
	The rest of the house is dark, quiet.  In the kitchen,
	he checks the message pad by the phone.  Nothing.  
	On the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.
	Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:
	"Frank. Please."
	Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.  
	The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.  
	Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer,
	Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and
	replaces it with a new one.  
	As he presses the photograph in place,
	his eyes drift to the one of himself.  
	It was taken a long time ago.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
	piano by the window.  As the needle hits the spinning
	disc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout
	the apartment.  Jack takes a drink, then joins in with
	the record, playing along.  His concentration is intense,
	so much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,
	he seems not to hear it.  Finally, he picks it up.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		It's me.

				JACK
		Frank?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the
		house tomorrow, will ya?

				JACK
		I've had enough family for one
		month, Frank.

				FRANK (V.0.)
		It's not family.  It's business.

				JACK
		So talk to me tomorrow.  After
		the gig.

				FRANK (V.0.)
		We don't get a gig.

				JACK
		What're you talking about?

				FRANK (V.0.)
		Something came up.  Don't worry,
		Charlie stayed true.  Both nights.
		I'll give you your share tomorrow.
		At the house.

	Silence.

				FRANK (V.0)
			(continuing)
		So you'll come out, right?

				JACK
		Yeah, okay.

	Jack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,
	then the CONNECTION goes DEAD.


	EXT.  STREET

	A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.  
	In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap
	gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.  
	He walks up to the door of a small white house and
	presses the doorbell.
	When there is no response, he goes around to the back.

	EXT. BACKYARD

	The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence
	surrounding it.  Two kids, a girl and a boy,
	are splashing around in a build-it-yourself
	above-ground pool.  
	When they see Jack, they stop splashing.
	Only their heads are visible above the water.

				JACK
		Hey, kids.  Dad home?

	The two heads say nothing.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		What d'ya say?  Wanna run and get
		him for me?

	Still nothing.  Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,
	and pats his pocket for a match.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Shit.

	The kids' eyes widen at his profanity.  
	Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,
	ponders things for a moment,
	then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.
	At which point,
	the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Hey, kid.  Take it easy.

	No use.  The kid's a world-class screamer.  
	Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,
	comes racing out of the house.

				FRANK
		Cindy!  What is it?

	Cindy points.  At Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jack.

				JACK
		Your doorbell doesn't work.

				FRANK
		Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You
		remember Uncle Jack.

	DONNA, Frank's wife, appears.

				DONNA
		What's the matter?  Jack?

	Jack waves.

				FRANK
			(lifting Cindy out of the pool)
		Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?

				DONNA
		I'll take her inside.  You too,
		little Frank.  Out of the pool.

	Donna shepherds the kids toward the house.

				FRANK
		Feet!

	The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
	and disappear into the house.  Frank turns to Jack.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		It's probably the excitement of
		seeing you again.


	EXT.  BACKYARD (LATER)

	Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.
	The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
	aluminum chairs.

				FRANK
		Well, look at this.

				DONNA
		You bring trunks, Jack?

				JACK
		Trunks?

				DONNA
		Swimming trunks.

				JACK
		Oh. No. Strictly dryland.

				DONNA
		Too bad.  You could use some sun.
		Really.

				JACK
		Maybe next time.

				DONNA
		We have some lotion.

				JACK
		Just the same.

				DONNA
		Suit yourself.

	Donna returns to the house.
	Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
	surroundings complacently.

				FRANK
		Nice, huh?

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.

				JACK
		Terrific.

				FRANK
			(expansively)
		Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.
		After the rains.  Look good as new.

				JACK
		You ask me out here to sell me
		your house, Frank?

	Frank shakes the ice in his glass.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Charlie paid you off last night,
		didn't he?

				FRANK
		I don't know what you mean.

				JACK
		The hell you don't.

				FRANK
		I told you.  Something came up.
		Some political dinner or something.

				JACK
		Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank.
		No one paid us off.

				FRANK
		It wasn't like that.

				JACK
		No?

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
		What was it like?

				FRANK
		Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?  
		I got two kids. I got a wife.
		Besides, he made the deal.  
		There's no shame in it.

				JACK
		That how you see it?


				FRANK
		Yeah, that's how I see it.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And don't go shaking your head, little brother.
		I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling
		like he's got a day job in a piss factory.
			(pause)
		It killed him, you know.

	Jack glances up.  Dangerous territory.

				JACK
		A gust of wind killed him.

				FRANK
		Yeah, and what put him up there?

				JACK
		Hey, you weren't there.  Right?

	Jack's look ends this.  Frank sighs.

				FRANK
		Look, can we forget last night?
		We gotta talk.

				JACK
		Talk.

				FRANK
		I been thinking maybe we should
		make some changes.
			(pause)
		I been thinking maybe we should
		take on a singer.

	Silence.

				JACK
		Sure, why not.

				FRANK
		It's just an idea.  I want your opinion.
		I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?

				JACK
		It's more like 40-60, wouldn't
		you say?

				FRANK
		We agreed that if I took care of the business;
		I'd be entitled to the extra.
		Isn't that what we agreed?

				JACK
		That's what we agreed.

				FRANK
		If you're unhappy with the
		arrangement --

				JACK
		I'm not unhappy.

				FRANK
		If you'd like to assume more of the financial
		responsibilities, I'd be glad --

				JACK
		Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?

				FRANK
		I've tried to do well by you, Jack.
		By both of us.

				JACK
		I'm grateful, Frank.  How much?
		For the singer.

				FRANK
		I thought maybe twenty percent.
		Look, with the additional bookings we'll
		come out ahead.  The big hotels,
		they want a pretty girl with a big voice.
		We have to stay competitive, Jack.

	Jack laughs coldly.

				FRANK
		What's that?

				JACK
		You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me
		we're different.  We got novelty, Jack.
		No one can touch us.

				FRANK
		Two pianos isn't enough anymore,
		Jack.

				JACK
		It never was.


	YOUNG WOMAN

	in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
	center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano
	showroom, holding some sheet music.  Sammy Davis Jr.'s
	face is on the sheet music.  Frank is sitting against
	the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.  
	Jack is at the piano.

				FRANK
		Good morning, Miss...?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Moran.  Monica Moran.

				FRANK
		All right, Miss Moran

				MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
		Actually, that's my stage name.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry?

				MONICA
		Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing.  
		It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.

				FRANK
		Blanche.

				MONICA
		No romance, right?  That's why I came up with
		Monica. It's what I prefer.

				FRANK
		Well, that's fine --

				MONICA
		But if you call my house and my mother answers,
		ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll
		think you have the wrong number and hang up.

				FRANK
		Right.

				MONICA
		And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.
		She's opposed to my career.

				FRANK
		Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what
		is it you'd like to do for us?

				MONICA
		Candy Man.'
			(worried)
		Is that all right?

				FRANK
		It's one of Jack's favorites.

	Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,
	gives a little start.

				MONICA
		Oops.  I almost forgot you were
		there.  Here's the music.

	Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.

				FRANK
		Uh... he knows it.

				MONICA
		Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.

				JACK
		Small world.

	Monica smiles.  She likes Jack.

				FRANK
		Well, shall we?

	Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,
	laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
	swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,
	Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
	has to scramble over a chord to catch her,
	sort of like a fireman with a net.

				MONICA
		Who can take a sunrise
		Sprinkle it with dew
		Toss it in the air and
		Make a groovy lemon pie
		The Candy Man can
		The Candy Man can...,

	There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
	mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
	daughter's career.

				FRANK
		Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.

	Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.
	Frank looks over at Jack.  
	Jack shrugs and continues to play.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...
		Blanche!

	Monica's eyes pop open.

				MONICA
		Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in
		it sometimes.  It's scary.

				FRANK
		Yes, it is.

				MONICA
		Well ... thanks.
			(to Jack)
		Bye.

				JACK
		Drive carefully.

	As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another
	and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
	singers who can't sing.  As Frank sinks lower in his
	chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded
	cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,
	and colors, come forth to offer their own unique
	interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"
	"This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
	"What Kind of Fool Am I."
	Finally, when it is all over,
	Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,
	looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.


	TALL YOUNG WOMAN

	As the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
	walks into Willie's.  She glances around,
	then spots Willie across the room,
	eating a corn beef on rye.

				WOMAN
		Hey.  You one of the fabulous
		Baker Boys?


	JACK AND FRANK

	are putting on their coats, preparing to leave.
	Frank is staring at his notepad.

				FRANK
		Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		Thirty-seven girls.
		And not one who can carry a tune.
		That must be statistically impossible.

				JACK
		It was a somewhat extraordinary
		day.

				FRANK
		I just don't understand.  You
		would think someone ... anyone ...

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Damn!

	The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,
	holding a shoe in her hand.  It's broken.

				WOMAN
			(continuing)
		Brand new Thursday.  You believe
		it?

	After today, Jack and Frank are prepared
	to believe anything.

				WOMAN
			(continuing)
		This where the auditions are?

				FRANK
		This is where the auditions were.

				WOMAN
		What do you mean?

				FRANK
		We're finished.

				WOMAN
		What about me?

	Frank looks at his watch.

				FRANK
		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN
		My watch is broken, too.

				FRANK
		Punctuality.  First rule of show
		business.

	The Woman looks around her.

				WOMAN
		This is show business?

				FRANK
			(in no mood)
		Look, miss.  We're tired,
		you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

				WOMAN
			(touching her lip)
		Just like that, huh?  You're not
		even gonna give me a chance?

				FRANK
		Don't take it personally.

				WOMAN
		How should I take it?

				FRANK
		Impersonally.

	Frank begins to leave.

				WOMAN
		I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down
		here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me
		a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a
		few minutes late.

				FRANK
		You're an hour and a half late.

				WOMAN
		So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?

				FRANK
		We ran long.

				WOMAN
		So run a little longer.

				FRANK
		Miss --

				WOMAN
		You find a girl?

	Jack and Frank glance at each other.

				JACK
		No.

				WOMAN
		So. I'm here, you're here, the
		piano's here.  What d'ya say?

	Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.

				FRANK
		Terrific.  Thirty-eight.

				WOMAN
		What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.

				JACK
		Don't worry about it.

				WOMAN
			(to Frank)
		You know, I'm feeling a lot of
		hostility from you.

				FRANK
			(appealing)
		Jack.

				JACK
		Let's get it over with.

				FRANK
		All right.  What's your name?

				WOMAN
		Susie.  Susie Diamond.

				FRANK
		Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment
		experience, Miss Diamond?

				SUSIE (WOMAN)
		Well ... for the last four years
		I've been on call to Triple A
		Escort service.

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner
		and dance.

				FRANK
		Okay.  I think that's all we
		need to know.

				SUSIE
		I sing now?

				FRANK
		That's the premise.

	Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.

				SUSIE
		I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,
		okay?

	Jack nods and begins to play.  
	Frank slouches down in his chair,
	preparing to be tortured again.

				SUSIE
			(continuing; singing)
		I get along without you very well
		Of course I do
		Except when soft rains fall
		And drip from leaves, then I recall
		The thrill of being
		Sheltered in your arms
		Of course I do
		But I get along without you very well.'

	Susie stops.  Frank just sits there.  
	Jack just sits there.  She can sing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So?

				FRANK
			(blinking)
		Uh ... we'll let you know.

	Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane.

				SUSIE
		When?

				FRANK
		When we know.

				SUSIE
			(smiling)
		Don't leave a girl hanging.
		Second rule of show business.

	Frank's not amused.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers.

	Susie walks out barefoot.

				JACK
		What are you, crazy?

				FRANK
		I just thought we should talk
		about it.  Between ourselves.

				JACK
		What's there to talk about?  She can sing.  
		That puts her at the head of the class.
		That makes her the only one in the class.

				FRANK
		I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,
		for Christ sake.  
		I don't think she's right for the act.

				JACK
			(studying him)
		You're getting cold feet about
		this.

				FRANK
		I was just thinking what Ma would
		think.

				JACK
		Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the
		Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass.
		How could I forget.

	Frank frowns and looks down at his hands.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
		Donna?  Little Cindy?  
		Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.

				FRANK
		Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

	Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.

				JACK
		What's the matter?

				FRANK
		I didn't get her number.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up
	and down the street.  Nothing.

				FRANK
		We can always look her up in the
		book.

		JACK.
		Right.  Susie Diamond.  She's probably listed right
		next to Monica Moran.

	Jack shakes his head in disgust.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Does this mean I get the job?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jack and Frank whirl around.

	There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.

				SUSIE
		Intuition.


	CITY SKYLINE

	Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.  
	Once again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,
	only this time carried a little further:
	"Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."


	JACK, FRANK AND SUSIE

	Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing
	for their first rehearsal ...

				FRANK
		Ready?

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

	Susie nods.  Frank poises his hands over the piano,
	hesitates, then looks at Jack again.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

	Jack squints at Frank, then nods.  
	Frank turns to Susie.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ready?

				SUSIE
			(looking around)
		What are we, an orchestra all of
		a sudden?

	Frank g1ares at her.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sorry.


	Frank poises his hands over the piano again and
	begins to play the opening passage of
	"Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,
	and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately,
	Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,
	are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
	fifth grade recital.
	After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.

				SUSIE
		Fellas, fellas ...

	Jack and Frank stop.

				FRANK
		What's the problem?

				SUSIE
		The problem is I can't hear myself
		sing with all this...
			(searching)
		... music.  You know what I'm saying?

	Jack and Frank look at one another.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,
		but up here I'm having a little trouble
		getting a word in.

	Jack and Frank just stare.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I mean, you're supposed to be
		backing me up, right?

				FRANK
			(icily)
		No. We are not supposed to be
		backing you up.

				SUSIE
		What I mean is --

				FRANK
		We're a team.  We work together.

				SUSIE
		So work with me, not against me.
		Okay?

	Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.

				FRANK
		I suppose we can bring it down a
		little.

				JACK
		I'll drop the eighths.

				FRANK
		Okay?

	Susie looks at the two brothers.

				SUSIE
		Okay.


	WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER

	Frank is on Willie's telephone.  
	In the front of the store, just out of earshot,
	Jack sits at a beat-up grand,
	while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.

				FRANK
		I'm telling you, Ray.  She's got
		a voice like an angel ... What?

	Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,
	making a very sexy silhouette against the front window,
	is running her hand over a pearl-white piano.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		No, I wouldn't say she's got a
		body like an angel.

	As Frank continues to talk in the background,
	Susie looks over at Jack.

				SUSIE
		Hey, he's not sore, is he?

				JACK
		He'll come around.

	Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		You never sang before?

				SUSIE
		Not for money. With my mother.

	Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		She used to waitress downtown, nights,
		when I was a kid.  On the way home, we'd sing.
		You know how people whistle when they're nervous?
		My mother sang.  She always said you're never alone
		with a song 'cause thousands of people know the
		same song and even though you can't hear 'em,
		they're singing with you.  I don't know.  
		If they were, they were all singing safe inside
		their apartments.
			(shrugging)
		But it worked.  We always got home.  Ever since,
		I always wanted to sing.  
		I never took lessons or anything, though.
		I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.

	Jack looks down at the piano in front of him.

				JACK
		Yeah.  We took a lot of lessons.


	JACK AND NINA

	Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
	ready for the night's gig.  Nina, standing next to him
	at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar
	of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.

				NINA
		You shave like an old movie, Jack.

	As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins
	to soap her face in the mirror.

				JACK
		In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that
		he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he
		wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop
		and there would be his mug, waiting for him.

				NINA
		Is that what you used to do?

				JACK
		My days are not the old days,
		genius.

				NINA
		What are they?

				JACK
		The recent past.

				NINA
		Oh.
			(nodding to the ceiling)
		Bigfoot gets his out of a can.

				JACK
		How do you know?

				NINA
		I saw his stuff in the bathroom.

				JACK
		Oh?

				NINA
		I guess it's getting serious.

				JACK
		Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry
		him.

				NINA
		I hope not.  He's already busted the springs
		in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?

	Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.

				JACK
		Ivory.

				NINA
		Looks old.

				JACK
		Older than me.

				NINA
		Wow.

	Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.
	Nina picks up the razor.

				JACK
		Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow
		a beard?

				NINA
		Why not?

				JACK
		Well, let's get your first prom
		under the belt, okay?

				NINA
		What's a prom?

				JACK
		Ever go to church?

	Nina nods.

				JACK
		It's like that.  Only you gotta
		dance.


	INT.  HOTEL

	As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard
	stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby.  
	It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation
	at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist."
	On the other side of the lobby,
	Frank is pacing nervously.

				FRANK
		Where the hell is she?

				JACK
		It's early.

				FRANK
		I told everyone seven-fifteen.
		Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.

				JACK
		She'll get here.

				FRANK
		Just like the day of the auditions,
		right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?


				JACK
		Awe inspiring.

				FRANK
		Yeah, well, Your's isn't.
			(taking out a comb)
		Let me run a comb though it.

				JACK
		Get out of here.

				FRANK
		Come on, stand still.

				JACK
		Get out of here!

				FRANK
		It's not gonna hurt you.

				JACK
		I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.

	Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to
	feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair.
	Jack hits him.

				FRANK
			(holding his shoulder)
		You hit me.

				JACK
		I told you I was gonna hit you.

	He looks capable of hitting him again, too.

				FRANK
		All right, all right.  I'm a little
		tense.

				JACK
		You're a fucking alarm clock.

				FRANK
		I just wish she'd get here, that's
		all.

				JACK
		She's here.

	Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress,
	is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.

				FRANK
		Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna
		wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense
		to come in the back.
			(walking over)
		Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.

				SUSIE
		Where's my name?

				FRANK
		What-?

				SUSIE
		And how come you guys are the only ones with
		your pictures on the poster?

				FRANK
		We'll talk about it later.  Right
		now, you gotta get changed.

				SUSIE
		Changed?

				FRANK
		Where's your dress?

				SUSIE
			(to Jack)
		What's he talking about?

				FRANK
		Is there a language problem here?  Your dress.
		For tonight.  Where is it?

				SUSIE
		Do I look like I'm naked?

				FRANK
		That!  You can't wear that!

				SUSIE
		What's wrong with it?

				FRANK
		It's orange!

				SUSIE
			(to Jack)
		Am I missing something?

	Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and
	pulls her toward the door.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				SUSIE
		Hey!

				FRANK
		Come on.  We don't have much time.

				SUSIE
		Time for what?


	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE

	Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous
	downtown department store, the brothers turning a few
	heads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies'
	department, Frank begins to flip through the
	dress racks.

				SUSIE
		If you ask me, this is pretty
		stupid.

				FRANK
		Just look.  What do you wear?
		A nine?

				SUSIE
			(offended)
		A seven.

				FRANK
		My wife wears a seven.  You don't
		look like a seven to me.

				SUSIE
		I wear a seven.

				FRANK
		Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?

				SUSIE
			(looking)
		Save it for your wife.

				FRANK
		We're not exactly silly with time,
		you know.  Jack, you find anything?

	Jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.

				JACK
		No.

				FRANK
		Here, how's this?

	Frank holds out an inky black dress.  Susie gives it
	a long look.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Close enough.  Let's go.

	Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.

				SUSIE
		Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I
		come from there's a little girl's room and a
		little boy's room and the little boys don't go
		where the little girls go.

				FRANK
		All right, but make it quick.
			(remembering)
		Shoes!  What size do you wear?

				SUSIE
			(from the dressing room)
		Nine.

				FRANK
		Nine?

				SUSIE
		Nine!

				FRANK
			(to himself)
		Big feet.


	INT.  SHOE DEPARTMENT

	Frank and Jack work the shoe department,
	scouting the endless rows.

				FRANK
		See anything?

				JACK
			(holding one up)
		How about these?

				FRANK
		Jack, for crying out loud.  Your
		bachelorhood's showing.
			(seeing something)
		Ah, here we go.

	Frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the
	SALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman.

				FRANK
		Hey!  Do these come in black?

				SALESMAN
		I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

				FRANK
		I don't have a minute, pal.  Yes
		or no?

				SALESMAN
			(glowering)
		Yes.  They come in black.

				FRANK
		Okay.  Give me a pair of nines.
		Pronto.

	The Salesman looks casually at Jack.

				SALESMAN
		Does he want a pair, too?


	INT.  DRESS DEPARTMENT

	As Jack and Frank return to the dress department,
	Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.

				FRANK
		All right, we got your shoes.

	Just then, Susie steps out of the dressing room.
	Even Frank stops at the sight of her.

				SUSIE
		What do you think?

				FRANK
		Uh... good.

				SUSIE
			(turning to Jack)
		Zip me up?

	The dress is open down to the small of her back.
	It's a nice back.
	Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Shoes?

				FRANK
		Right.

	Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them.

				SUSIE
		They're tight.

				FRANK
		They're nines.

				SUSIE
		Well, they're aspiring to be
		sevens.

				FRANK
		You can buy new ones tomorrow.

				SUSIE
		Oh, thanks.

				FRANK
		Don't worry.  We'll take it out
		of your share.

				SUSIE
		You're a prince.


	INT.  HOTEL

	As the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance,
	RAY, the assistant manager, appears.

				RAY
		You better buy yourself a watch,
		Frankie.

				FRANK
		We had a little emergency.

				RAY
		Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency.
		You know what I'm saying?
			(seeing Susie)
		Who's this, Minnie Pearl?

	All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the
	tags attached.

				FRANK
			(moving off)
		Jesus.

				RAY
		I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.
		You hear me?

				JACK
		This is going well, isn't it?


	INT.  KITCHEN

	The three rush into the kitchen.

				FRANK
		We need scissors over here!
		Who's got scissors?
			(turning to Susie)
		Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first,
		I do the set-up, then introduce you.
		And you say ...

				SUSIE
			(deadpan)
		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
		I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.  
		It's like a dream come true.
		And speaking of dreams ...

				FRANK
		Right.

				SUSIE
		Piece of cake.

	A tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.

				FRANK
		Carlos, that's,a cleaver.  I need
		scissors.

				CARLOS (MAN)
		No scissors.

				FRANK
		Jesus Christ.  All right.  Let's
		go, Jack.  Fix your tie.

	Jack and Frank exit.  
	Susie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver.

	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos.  
	About half the tables in the room are filled.

				FRANK
		Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  
		Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.  
		My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not
		seeing double, it's just my
		little brother, Jack.

	Some laughter.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,
		because we've got a very special
		evening planned ...


	INT.  KITCHEN

	Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags
	on a cutting board.  As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by,
	Susie snares a drink from her tray.

				WAITRESS
		Hey!

				SUSIE
		Just a sip.  To kill the
		butterflies, okay?

				WAITRESS
		Okay.  But no lipstick.

	Susie takes a quick sip.

				SUSIE
		There.  No one's the wiser.

				WAITRESS
		Nice dress.

	As the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down
	with a sharp chop, severing the tags.

				SUSIE
		Appreciate it, Ace.


	LOUNGE

	The audience is laughing.

				FRANK
		But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,
		looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help
		but feel some of us have met before.  We may not
		know each other's names, we might not recognize
		one another on the street, but we know each other
		just the same.  And over the years we've shared
		something.  A little music, a little drink,
		a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.  
		But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?

	Applause.  Jack puts out his cigarette.

				JACK
		Oh, brother.

				FRANK
		And it's especially nice to be among friends
		tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special
		night for my brother and I. This evening we've
		asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I
		are sure will soon seem like just another old
		friend to you all.  She's making her debut here
		this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she
		couldn't be doing it in a better place.
		Because there's one place that's always been for
		us a very special place, and that place is this
		place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen,
		please welcome a very special lady with a very
		special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.

	Applause.  Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the
	busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which,
	unfortunately, is not on.

				FRANK
			(continuing; whispering)
		The switch.  Hit the switch.

				SUSIE
		Switch?
			(as she hits it)
		What fucking switch?

	Silence.

				SUSIE
			(continuing; very demure)
		Pardon me.

	Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before
	outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.  
	Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I can't tell you how thrilled I
		am to be here.

	For the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure
	how thrilled they are to be here.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I'm all smiles, darling
		Through and through...'


	INT.  LOBBY

	A BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice
	coming from the lounge, stops.  
	He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.

				BELLBOY
		I thought the Bakers were on
		tonight.

				CLERK
		They are.

				BELLBOY
		Well, who's that?

	The Clerk looks up from the register and listens.

				CLERK
		I don't know.  Frank?


	INT.  LOUNGE

	Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the
	lounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes
	closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long
	extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic,
	exhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence,
	then thunderous applause.  Magic.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	The new trio, fresh off their first gig,
	come out of the service entrance into the night.

				FRANK
		Fucking.  She says fucking in
		front of an entire room of people.

				SUSIE
		I said I was sorry.

				FRANK
			(to Jack)
		Did you hear it?

				JACK
		Fucking.

				SUSIE
		Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais
		by the time I got out there anyway.

				FRANK
			(directly to her)
		Fucking.

				SUSIE
		For Christ sake, I said it, I
		didn't do it.
			(pulling out some bills)
		Besides, I don't think they were
		too offended, do you?

				FRANK
			(grabbing the bills)
		Give me that.

				SUSIE
		Hey!

				FRANK
		We are not a saloon act.  We do
		not take tips from dirty old men.

				SUSIE
			(innocent)
		I was gonna split it with you guys.

				FRANK
		We do not take tips.  I'll apply
		this to the cost of the dress.

	Frank puts the money in his pocket.  Susie stares at
	him, steaming.

				SUSIE
		Then I want my name on the poster.
		And my picture!
			(taking off her shoes)
		And these shoes are too goddamn tight!

	Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.
	Jack is leaning against the wall,
	watching it all with amusement.

				JACK
		Nice girl.

	ON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
	"New York, New York" and we see:


	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
	another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,
	no empty tables now.

	As the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,
	newly done over with a picture of Susie and an
	accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie
	Diamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --

	CUT TO:


	INT.  LLOYD'S OFFICE

	Jack and Frank, once again in the office of the
	supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their
	cash envelope.

				LLOYD
		Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched
		onto.  She a local?

				FRANK
		Born and bred.

				LLOYD
		Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys.  
		Don't spend it all in one place.  
		Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?

				FRANK
		We trust you, Lloyd.  You know
		that.

	Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave.

				LLOYD
		Say, Frankie.  Since I've got you here...
		How's next week look for you guys?

	Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him.  
	Jack's eyes go cold.

				JACK
		We'll call you.

	As Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the
	hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool,
	then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
	because they're about to burst out laughing.



	FOLLOWING SHOT

	By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing,
	tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and
	onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the
	night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
	together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing
	under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching
	them with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a
	clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing
	their throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales
	a plume of smoke, studies them a moment,
	then smiles slightly.

				SUSIE
		Night, Bakers.

	As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her
	trim shadow disappear down the street.


	EXT.  CITY

	Gray and cold.  The streets swept with rain.  
	And once again the tentative piano:
	"JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
	Oh what fun it is to ride ...
	Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."


	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room:
	small and dirty and packed with pet owners and
	their animals.
	After a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears.

				WOMAN
		Barker.
			(no takers)
		Jock Barker?

				JACK
			(realizing it's him)
		Baker.  Jack Baker.

				WOMAN
		Right.  Bring him back.

				JACK
		Come on, Ed.

	Jack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor.

				WOMAN
		You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.
		The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.

				JACK
		He doesn't bite.

				WOMAN
		They never do, Mr. Barker.

				JACK
		Baker.

				WOMAN
		Right.  In there.

	The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room.
	There is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall,
	a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats.
	Jack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie,
	who's staring up at him.

				JACK
		You shoulda brushed, pal.

	Just then, a MAN in a white coat breezes in.

				DR. BEASLEY (MAN)
		Ah, labradorus retreiverus.  Good fellows.  
		Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.

	Dr. Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack.

				DR. BEASLEY
		Beasley.

				JACK
		Baker.

				DR. BEASLEY
		What's our friend's problem?

				JACK
		Teeth.

				DR. BEASLEY
		What's wrong with them?

				JACK
		They're falling out.

				DR. BEASLEY
		Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's
		get him up here.

	Jack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr. Beasley opens
	Eddie's mouth for a look.  It doesn't take long.

				DR. BEASLEY
		They gotta go.

				JACK
			(a take)
		How many?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Five's my guess.  Maybe more.
		Won't know till I get in there.
			(consulting his clipboard)
		Leave him now and you can pick
		him up in the morning.

				JACK
		Isn't there something you can
		give him?  A pill or something?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to
		the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.
		Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,
		would we?

				JACK
		How will he eat?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Start him out on cottage cheese.  
		If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a
		few minutes.  Go down like pudding
		through a hot pipe.

				JACK
		No bones?

				DR. BEASLEY
		No bones.

	Jack looks at Eddie.

				JACK
		What do you do to him?

				DR. BEASLEY
		Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out.
		He won't feel a thing.

				JACK
		I think maybe I'll bring him back
		next week ...

				DR. BEASLEY
		The sooner we do this the better,
		Mr. Baker.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone.
	He glances back at the vet's with second thought,
	then moves slowly off.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the
	refrigerator.  A carton of cream, a few eggs --
	there's not much there.  He takes a small container of
	cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an
	empty shelf.  As he closes the refrigerator door, he
	glances around the apartment.  It is very still, very
	quiet.  He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks
	over to the window and looks out.  There is a mug of
	coffee there on the sill.  He takes it and holds it in
	both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.
	He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over
	the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on
	the keys and begins to play.  "Jingle Bells."


	INT.  CORNER DINER

	In the front window, room has been made among the
	photographs for one of Susie.  Inside, Jack, Frank
	and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee
	cups and cigarettes.  Frank has several slips of paper
	before him with names and dates.

				FRANK
		The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the
		Carlton or the Plaza.  Four day turns.
		What do you think, Jack?

	Jack is staring out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jack, you with us?

				SUSIE
		The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum.
		And they water their drinks.
		It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

	Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.

				FRANK
			(watching)
		I guess it's,the Plaza then.  
		That brings us to the twenty-seventh.  
		We got the Avedon for three or the Park
		downtown for two.

				SUSIE
		We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.

	Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack.  Jack shakes
	his head.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The Park?  It's only two nights.
		Why throw away a night?

				JACK
		Because Blackie Carson books the Park and
		whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.

				SUSIE
		Oh.
			(lifting her glass)
		Well, for Blackie then.

				FRANK
		By the way, I got a messsage
		yesterday from some guy looking for
		New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.

				SUSIE
			(likes "resort')
		Hey.

				JACK
		Sounds like a booking agent
		looking to book an easy fee.

				FRANK
		That's what I figure.  Probably have us in
		a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.

				SUSIE
		Maybe it's legit.

				FRANK
		Maybe.  I'll call him.

				JACK
		Make it collect.

				FRANK
			(shuffling his slips)
		That's it except for the first.
		We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the
		Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.

	Frank looks at Jack.

				JACK
		Draw.

	Susie shrugs.

				SUSIE
		How'd you guys used to decide what
		gig to take?

	Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

				FRANK
		Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.

				SUSIE
		So find a dime.  Let's get out
		of here.


	EXT.  DINER

	Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their
	collars up against the chill.  
	Frank pulls on a pair of gloves.

				FRANK
		Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.  
		Where're your gloves?

	Jack shrugs.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Better take care of your fingers, little brother.  
		Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't
		be able to play 'Chopsticks.'

				JACK
		I'll take my chances.

	Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street.

				FRANK
		Something, huh?  All those bids.

				JACK
		Yeah.  Something.

				FRANK
		Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.

				JACK
		You wanna get a drink?

	Frank stops, surprised.

				FRANK
		No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been
		up two nights making sure the rest of us
		don't get it.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You all right?

				JACK
		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK
		Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.

				JACK
		Right.

	As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,
	then disappears around the corner.  A second later,
	Susie comes out of the diner.

				SUSIE
		Where's egghead?

				JACK
		His kid's sick.

				SUSIE
			(searching her purse)
		I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two
		as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've
		scrambled the babies somewhere.


				JACK
		He takes after our mother.

				SUSIE
		Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be
		one crazy dame.  Shit.

	Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.

				SUSIE
		Uh-uh.  I never touch American
		cigarettes.
			(still searching)
		What's tomorrow again?

				JACK
		The Stratford.

				SUSIE
		Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even
		the bedspreads.
			(shaking the purse)
		Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go
		through 'em like toothpicks.
		Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,
		you believe that?

				JACK
		Huh?

				SUSIE
		Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat
		down with a pencil and added it one day.  But
		I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something
		in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.
			(finding one)
		Ah, here's a lost soul.

	Jack lights it.  She takes a draw.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well,
		au revoir.

				JACK
		Hey.
			(as she stops)
		You feel like a cup of coffee?

				SUSIE
		You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in
		there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.

				JACK
		You want me to walk you?

	Susie looks at Jack a little funny.

				SUSIE
		No. Thanks.
		She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are
		you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me
		and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like
		I'm some kinda princess when I burp.

		JACK
		Forget it.

				SUSIE
		I mean, that'd be too creepy.
		With us working together and all.

				JACK
		Forget it.

				SUSIE
		Nothing personal --

	Jack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there.

				JACK
		Better hurry.  You're a nickel
		down on your cigarette.


	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his
	arms against the night's chill.  He glances up at the
	flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour
	Emergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is
	bent over a magazine.  Jack hesitates then enters.


	INT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

				KID
		Yeah?

	Jack glances around, ill at ease.

				KID
			(continuing)
		You want something, pal?  If you're looking for a
		bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.

	The Kid goes back to his magazine.

				JACK
		No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.
		He needed some work on his mouth.

				KID
		Regular hours are eight to five.

				JACK
		Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by.
		Thought I'd check in on him.

				KID
		You can check in on him tomorrow.  
		Between eight and five.

				JACK
		Yeah, well, couldn't I take a
		look now?

	The Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt.

				KID
		You want to know if he's okay.
		Right?

				JACK
			(uncomfortable)
		Yeah.

				KID
		All right.  Hold on.

				JACK
		The name's Baker --

				KID
		Save it.  What's he look like?

				JACK
			(puzzled)
		Black.  Labrador.

				KID
		All right. they lay the dead ones out in the
		cold room.  I'll take a look.

	The Kid disappears into the back.  Jack stands frozen,
	watching the swinging door come to rest.  He looks
	like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed
	to his neck.  He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't
	light it.  He waits.  A moment later, the door swings
	open.

				KID
		Nope.  Just a couple poodles.

	Jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.


	EXT.  VETERINARY CLINIC

	Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	On the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing
	a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie.
	Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest.  
	In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan.

				NINA
		I tried Cheerios this morning.  
		He didn't even get up.
		Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.

				JACK
		He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it,
		pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

	Jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next
	to the others.  Nina and he wait.  At first, nothing, then
	... Eddie's eyes move.  His nose twitches.  
	His head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the
	bowl.  He eats.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Chili.


	CITY

	draped in winter.  Dark skies, people lost in heavy
	coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung
	tenuously across traffic-clogged streets.  Over it all
	we hear "JINGLE BELLS," PLAYED for the first time
	completely through, hesitantly but without error.
	As the SONG ENDS, we are:


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	watching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly.
	She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch.

				JACK
			(nodding to the ceiling)
		You're gonna knock her dead, kid.


	INT.  LUAU LOUNGE

	All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve.
	Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own
	little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the
	happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be
	mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable.
	Frank just looks happy. As they finish,
	the crowd applauds.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the
	lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the
	mirror, fussing with his beard.


				JACK
		Hey, Frank.

				FRANK
		You recognized me.

				JACK
		Just a lucky guess.

				FRANK
		So what do you think?

				JACK
		Very realistic.

				FRANK
			(not buying it)
		Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had
		forty pounds on me.
		Jesus, you remember him being this big?

	Jack looks in the mirror.

				JACK
		Yeah.

				FRANK
		Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.
		Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.


	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving
	a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege
	of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.

				FRANK
		You want to come out to the house tomorrow?
		The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided
		to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the
		whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can
		hardly move.  We could use another appetite.

				JACK
		Thanks, but I've got plans.

				FRANK
		All right, but if you change your mind,
		let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the
		morning anyway.

				SUSIE
			(coming up)
		Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You
		moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?

				FRANK
		For the kids.
			(moving off)
		Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't
		forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

	Frank pushes through the revolving door and steps
	out into the street in his Santa suit.

				SUSIE
		He do that every year?

				JACK
		Every year.

				SUSIE
		Aren't the kids asleep?

				JACK
		Every year.

				SUSIE
		So why's he do it?

				JACK
		I guess in case one year they're not.

	Jack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the
	door and exits.  Susie watches him go, then turns to
	the desk clerk.

				SUSIE
		Call me a cab, will ya?


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	As Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in
	the room and looks over to the old phone booth.  
	Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head
	tilted against the glass.  Jack studies her a moment,
	then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the
	kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses.  He pulls a chair
	over to the phone booth and sits down.

				NINA
		How'd the show go?

				JACK
		Okay.  How'd yours go?

				NINA
		Not so good.

	Jack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the
	soft shadows of the booth.  After a moment, her eyes
	shift to the carton in his hand.

				NINA
		Eggnog?

	Jack nods.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		From Hurley's?

				JACK
		Eighty proof. What d'ya say?
		Think you can handle it?

	Nina nods. Jack begins to fill the two glasses.

				NINA
		Jack.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				NINA
		Can I stay here tonight?  Even if
		she comes here?

	Jack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets
	it aside.

				JACK
		Sure.

		He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.

				NINA
		Merry Christmas, Jack.

				JACK
		Merry Christmas.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

	Jack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room,
	looking down at something.

				NINA
		What do you think?

	Eddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog
	sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why
	he's the object of so much attention.

				JACK
		Very cool.


	EXT. CEMETERY - JACK, NINA AND EDDIE
	(sporting his new sweater)

	make their way across an empty cemetery.
	Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.

				NINA
			(looking around)
		There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi
		down at the drugstore says it's going to snow
		by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows.
		I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman.
		You ever make a snowman, Jack?

				JACK
		Sure.

				NINA
		That's what I want to do.  
		I want to make a snowman.

	As they come to a plot of ground, they stop.  
	There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,
	fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing
	only her name.  Jack studies the plot a moment, then
	crouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.
	Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin
	and John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the
	stone, then stands.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Now?

	Jack nods.  Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours
	it onto the dead man's grave.

				NINA
			(continuing)
		Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.

	They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.
	As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new
	sweater sniffing at a gravestone.

				JACK
		Hey, Eddie.  Have some respect,
		will ya?


	EXT.  BUILDING

	Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.
	A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and
	Jack gets in.  Susie is sitting up front.


	INT.  CAR

	Frank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent
	with family, cheerfully maneuvers the car
	through the city.

				FRANK
		So. How was everyone's Christmas?

	Jack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Too early, huh?  Well, there's coffee and donuts
		for whoever wants them.  
		How about a maple bar, Jack?

	Jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.

	Jack stares at the back of Frank's head,
	then puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in
	the donut bag and looks a little sick.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		By the way, if anyone gets bored,
		Donna packed some travel games.
		They work wonders with the kids.

	Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack
	full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You two could play checkers.

				SUSIE
		Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

				FRANK
		Sorry.  It only plays static.

	Susie looks at the radio,
	then at the games in her hands.

				SUSIE
		How long did you say it takes to
		get to this place?


	INT. CAR - FEW HOURS LATER

	Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape,
	an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.  
	Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an
	elaborate plastic puzzle.

				FRANK
		Any more coffee?

	Susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos.

				SUSIE
		Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this?

	Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger.  Inside,
	there are hundreds of tiny entries.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You play all these places?

				FRANK
		Baker's unabridged.

				SUSIE
		Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of
		noise.  What's with the stars?

				FRANK
		Virgins.

				SUSIE
		Virgins?

				FRANK
		First times. Hey, look at this.

	A crepe-covered car surrounded by several other
	HONKING VEHICLES passes by.  Jack stares at the beaming
	newlyweds as they glide past his window,
	two kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado
	covered with toilet paper.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		When's the last time we played a
		wedding, Jack?

				JACK
		Two years ago.  March.

				SUSIE
			(consulting the ledger)
		He's right.

				FRANK
		He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

	Susie looks at Frank curiously.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Go ahead.

				SUSIE
			(scanning the book)
		Okay.The Fantasy Inn.

				FRANK
		Jack?

				JACK
			(staring out the window)
		November.  '71.

				FRANK
		First night?

				JACK
		Day.  Wednesday.

				FRANK
		Last?

				JACK
		Sunday.

				SUSIE
		I don't believe it.

				FRANK
		I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music.
		Hears it once and he's got it.

		Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		My brilliant little brother.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is
	built right on the ocean.  Frank guides the car down
	a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.

				FRANK
		Will you listen to that ocean?

	It's LOUD.  Frank takes a deep breath.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And how about this air? I'm telling you,
		a few days in this place'll put five years
		on your life.

				SUSIE
		Smells like fish.

				FRANK
		Of course it smells like fish.  
		We're on the ocean.
		What'd you expect, Chanel number five?

				SUSIE
			(to herself)
		Smells like tuna number two to me.

				FRANK
		It's paradise.  That's what it is.
		Paradise.

	As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack
	notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,
	its toilet paper streamers blowing
	gently in the ocean breeze.


	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY

	The lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there
	are a lot of swords on the walls.
	Franks steps up to the front desk.

				FRANK
		Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.

				CLERK
		Glad to meet you.  I'm Terrific
		Tom.

				FRANK
		No. We're the entertainment.

				TOM (CLERK)
		Oh, right, gotcha.  You got bags?

				FRANK
		Outside.  Blue Chevy.

				TOM
			(ringing a bell)
		Cyril.  Chevy.  Blue.  Take 'em up
		to the Guinevere Suite.

	A lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles
	out for the bags.  Tom hands Frank the room keys.

				TOM
			(continuing)
		Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker.
		You can practically dangle your toes
		in the water.


	INT.  SUITE

	Tom wasn't kidding.  The immediacy of the ocean beyond
	the window is almost scary.

				FRANK
		You believe this?  I'm telling you, we're getting
		away with murder.  Two shows a night and the rest
		of the time we live like kings.  It's a crime.

	Jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed
	side by side.  Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom.

				SUSIE
		Hey, we're connected.

				FRANK
		Great.

				SUSIE
		Great?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

	Susie shrugs and returns to her room through the
	bathroom.

				JACK
		I thought we had separate rooms.

				FRANK
			(opening drawers)
		We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.
		Wash and Dries.

				JACK
		I thought we all had separate rooms.

				FRANK
		Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first
		time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when
		we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which,
	like their rooms, looks out over the ocean.  
	Dinner is over and they're well
	through a second bottle of wine.

				SUSIE
		You're kidding me.

				FRANK
		As Charlie Steinway is my witness.

				SUSIE
		Peggy Lee?

				FRANK
		Tell her.

				JACK
		She was staying at the Grand
		downtown ...

				FRANK
		It was April.  April seventeenth.
		That one I remember.

				JACK
		We were playing the lounge one
		night and she came in.

				FRANK
		Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.

				JACK
		Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said
		yes, and we did a few bars.

				FRANK
		A few bars!

				SUSIE
		What'd she sing?

				FRANK
		People.' You think Streisand, right?  
		Hot that night.  Chills.  
		Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.

				SUSIE
		Wow. You ever see her again?

				FRANK
		No. We got a picture, though.  
		One of the waitresses had a camera.
			(to Jack)
		God, we were just kids.  That was
		something, wasn't it?

	Jack nods.  Frank shakes his head, still lost in the
	spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds
	sitting across the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, will you look at that?

				SUSIE
		They must've bought the same
		map we did.

				FRANK
		What do you say we send a bottle
		over?

				SUSIE
		I don't believe it.  You're a
		romantic, Frank.

				JACK
		He's drunk.

				FRANK
		Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.

				SUSIE
		Oh yeah?

				FRANK
		He's just afraid to show it.
		Aren't you, little brother?

				JACK
		Have some more wine, Frank.

				FRANK
		Good idea.
			(lifting his glass)
		To Peggy Lee.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Frank, standing, dressed in pajamas.
	Jack is staring out the window at the darkness.

				FRANK
		I'm putting my stuff on the right,
		okay?

				JACK
		Okay.

				FRANK
		I figure that way we won't get confused.

				JACK
		Right.

				FRANK
		Unless you want the right.

				JACK
		No, you take the right.

				FRANK
		We might as well do the towels the same way.

				JACK
		Okay.

				FRANK
		I just figure things'll go smoother, you know,
		if we have it all worked out from the beginning.

				JACK
		Good idea.

				FRANK
		But if it doesn't work out, let
		me know.  I'm,flexible.

				JACK
		Right.

	Frank nods and moves to the bed.

				JACK
			(continuing; re: the bathroom light)
		You leaving that on?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

				JACK
		All night?

				FRANK
		Yeah.

				JACK
		We're gonna be here a week?

				FRANK
			(puzzled)
		Yeah.

				JACK
		So you're gonna leave it on.
		Every night.  For a week.

				FRANK
		Yeah.  You mind?

				JACK
		Why would I mind?

				FRANK
		I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
		I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. I didn't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid.
		It was never a big deal then.  Was it?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. Well.  You want me to turn
		it off?

	Jack just stares at Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'll turn it off.

	Jack turns back to the window.

				JACK
		Forget it.  It's no big deal.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack and Frank are standing
	in a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands.

				FRANK
		They're beauties, huh?

	Jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.

	Frank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily.
	Jack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening.
	After a moment, Frank notices.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		What?


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	A short, stubby LITTLE MAN in a charcoal suit strides
	into the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom.

				MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)
		Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels,
		the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you
		on the phone.

				FRANK
			(offering his hand)
		That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker.  
		This is my brother Jack.

	Jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.

				MR. DANIELS
		Tom here tells me there's a problem with the
		pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.

				FRANK
		Yes, well, they are.

				MR. DANIELS
		Then I'm afraid I don't understand.

				FRANK
		They are in tune.  But not with
		each other.

				MR. DANIELS
		Is that important?

				FRANK
		Uh, well ...

				JACK
		Yes.  It's important.

	Frank glances nervously at Jack.

				MR. DANIELS
		Tom, who're we dealing with on
		these?

				TOM
		A Mr. Reynolds, sir.  But he's gone on vacation.
		I called this morning.

				MR. DANIELS
		Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.  
		Not being a musician myself I find it difficult
		to grasp the magnitude of this.  I don't suppose
		there's any way you could just ... accommodate.

				JACK
		Accommodate?  I don't think I know
		what you mean.

				FRANK
		I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,
		Jack, is --

				JACK
		Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell
		us what he's trying to say.

				MR. DANIELS
		I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.
		I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?


	INT.  HALLWAY

	Frank dogs Jack down a hallway.

				FRANK
		Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like
		a kid.

				JACK
		No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around
		one of these assholes and you turn into a
		fucking three-year-old.

				FRANK
		What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a
		little out of tune.  So what?

				JACK
			(stopping)
		Christ, can't you hear it?

				FRANK
		No! I never hear it!
			(shaking his head)
		Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know.
		But I won't let it bother me.

				JACK
		Doesn't it matter to you?

				FRANK
		What matters to me is we've got the six easiest
		nights we've had in ten years.  
		So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.  
		So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody.
		So why should you care?

				JACK
		Because I can hear it.

				FRANK
		Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because
		come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that
		dining room with smiles on.
		Understand, little brother?


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM

	Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror.
	Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the
	glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean
	goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a
	little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.

				SUSIE
		Hey, fellas.  What's the word?

	Nothing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		What's with you two?

				FRANK
		Jack woke up on the wrong side
		of the bottle.

	Susie looks at Jack.  Then Frank.

				SUSIE
		0-kay.


	INT.  LOUNGE

	As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night,"
	dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor,
	while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails.
	As the song ends, the couples applaud.

				FRANK
		Thank you, thank you.
			(as applause dies)
		You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived
		here yesterday, but already the people here at the
		King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,
		well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,
		before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part
		of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days,
		we should happen to pass one another in the hallway
		or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.
		Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here,
		there are no strangers, only friends.  
		And family.  Right, Jack?

				JACK
		Right.  I love you, Frank.

				FRANK
			(stunned)
		What?

				JACK
		I love you.  I just wanted to say it.

	Frank stares incredulously at Jack.

				FRANK
		Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.
			(moving quickly along)
		So. Susie.  How 'bout it.

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				FRANK
		Got another song for us?

				SUSIE
		Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.

				FRANK
		Well then ... shall we?


	BACKSTAGE

	Frank corners Jack as they exit the stage.
	Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching.

				FRANK
			(whispering)
		What's the matter with you?

				JACK
		I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family.
		I just got emotional.

				FRANK
		How dare you say you love me.

				JACK
		It won't happen again.  Scout's
		honor.

				SUSIE
		What's with you guys?

				FRANK
		Someone needs to grow up.  I won't
		take it, Jack.

				JACK
		Sure you will.

	Jack pushes past Frank and leaves.  
	Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Middle of the night.  Jack, fully clothed,
	is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking.
	Susie enters.

				SUSIE
		Oh, sorry.  With the light always
		on, it's hard to tell.

				JACK
		It's okay.
			(the cigarette)
		Last one.

				SUSIE
		Can't sleep?

				JACK
		In and out.

				SUSIE
		It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say.
		She was crazy for the ocean.

				JACK
		Yeah, well, I wish God would go
		a little easy on the trumpets.

				SUSIE
		How's egghead?

				JACK
		Like a baby. You?

				SUSIE
		In and out.

	Jack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		If you want, I got a pack in the
		room.

				JACK
		No thanks.  I never touch French
		cigarettes.


	INT.  LOBBY - DAY

	The next morning.  As Jack passes through the lobby,
	he hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO.  Curious,
	he goes to the dining room and peers in.  
	The tables have yet to be set for the evening and,
	except for Frank, the room is empty.

				JACK
		What the hell are you doing?

				FRANK
			(not looking up)
		What's it look like I'm doing?
		I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

				JACK
		Really.

				FRANK
		Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy,
		Jack.  If you say it's out of tune,
		it's out of tune.

	Jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.

				JACK
		How's it coming?

				FRANK
		Fine.

				JACK
		How long you been at it?

				FRANK
			(shrugging)
		Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna
		get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?

				JACK
		They stopped serving two hours ago.

				FRANK
		Two hours ago!

				JACK
		Time flies, huh?

	Frank looks despairingly at the pianos.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		I could give you a hand.  If
		you want.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - DAY

	Jack and Frank are eating lunch.  Frank has a tiny
	stack of blue cards he's perusing.  
	He holds one out to Jack.

				FRANK
		What do you make that?  Paruchi?

	Jack nods.  Frank continues to go through the cards
	as he speaks.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You haven't seen Susie, have you?

				JACK
		No. Why?

				FRANK
		Just wonder what she's up to.
		I never see her.  Makes me nervous.

				JACK
		She's a big girl.

				FRANK
		Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better
		keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.
			(another card)
		Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane.  
		Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?

				JACK
		What the hell are these?

				FRANK
		Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road.
		See, every morning the maids drop one of these
		cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card,
		leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play
		it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.
			(whispering)
		And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine
		o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking
		about our availability.  Like he wants to line
		something up.
		I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.

				WOMAN
		Excuse me.

	Frank jumps.  A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop
	dress pokes her head in.

				WOMAN
		I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting
		here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.

				FRANK
		Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my
		brother.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)
		Oh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you
		play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.

				FRANK
		Oh. Well, thank you.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		No, I mean you.
			(to Jack)
		I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.
		Exactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry
		in your family tree, do you?

				JACK
		Afraid not.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		Well, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.
		Of course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,
		I mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn
		mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.
		Can imagine?

	Jack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
			(continuing)
		Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was
		no relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.

	Florence Simmons gives a little flutter of
	a wave and exits.

				FRANK
		Funny, huh?

				JACK
		What?

				FRANK
		Thinking there's someone who looks like you,
		walking around the street somewhere.
			(smiling)
		Wonder if I saw him I'd think it
		was you?


	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
	hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.  
	As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices
	Florence Simmons standing a few yards away
	with a camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		I just know my sister won't believe
		me. Do you mind?

	Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
	camera.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		I really hate to impose.  It's just that the
		resemblance is so extraordinary.
			(focusing)
		I wonder if you could turn this way so your face
		isn't in the shadows.

	As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying
	shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
	end of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind,
	her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
		Say cheese.

	The camera clicks.

				FLORENCE SIMMONS
			(continuing)
		Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for
		yourself?  The hotel develops.

	Jack glances away from Susie and the man.

				JACK
		No.

	ON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
	later we --

	CUT TO:


	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	That evening.  The trio has just finished a song and
	those on the dance floor are clapping.

				FRANK
		Thank you.  You know, before we came out here
		this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking
		over your dedications and something struck us.

	Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea
	what he's talking about.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		We realized that, well, we're really not so
		different from one another after all.  Oh sure,
		we may be at different points in our journey,
		but we all travel pretty much the same road.
		And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce
		you to two very special couples.  First, married
		for all of two days, please say hello to Helen
		and Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.

	Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
	couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the
	front of the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		And now, our second couple.  I'm talking about
		Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,
		Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told
		you they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?
		Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane
		have been married for seventy-five years!

	The audience lets go with an audible "ooh"
	and applauds enthusiastically.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ethel, Bert.  Get up here and
		show these kids how it's done.

	A path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
	their way to the dance floor.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Aren't they a sight?

	They are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the
	dance floor than Frank anticipated.

	He nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary
	Waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage
	while they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone
	on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from
	a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the
	way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center
	of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger
	couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.


	INT.  BATHROOM

	Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He
	hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a
	man's.  He puts out his cigarette in the
	sink and leaves.


	INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

	The next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is
	returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.
	Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to
	see a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged,
	he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.

				SUSIE
			(opening door)
		Forget your tie, handsome ...
		Frank!

				FRANK
		You want to tell me what the
		hell's going on?

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				FRANK
		I just saw a man walk out of
		your room.

				SUSIE
		Uh ...

				FRANK
		In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be
		here.  So it might be nice if you conducted
		yourself with a certain amount of decency.

				SUSIE
		Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...

				FRANK
		No. You listen.  I had my doubts
		about you from the beginning

				JACK
		Hey!

	Frank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		What're you trying to do?  Wake
		up the whole goddamn hotel?

				FRANK
		We were just having a little
		discussion about morality.

				SUSIE
		Some discussion.

				FRANK
		I just saw a man walk out of your
		room!

				JACK
		You saw wrong.

				FRANK
		Huh?

				JACK
		He's with the hotel.  I called him.

				FRANK
		What are you talking about?

				JACK
		We had a leak in the bathroom.
		He fixed it.

				FRANK
		He was wearing a suit.

				JACK
		He had to come quickly.  It was
		a big leak.

				FRANK
		How come I didn't hear anything?

				JACK
		You're a heavy sleeper, Frank.
		You've always-been a heavy sleeper.
			(looking at Susie)
		Unlike me.

	Frank looks at Jack, then Susie.

				FRANK
		I guess I ... If I jumped to...

				SUSIE
		Forget it.

	The three stand there awkwardly for a moment.

				FRANK
		Well...

	Frank shrugs lamely and exits.

				SUSIE
		Boy, he comes on like a hurricane
		in the morning, doesn't he?

	Jack just stares at her.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Yeah, well, thanks for sticking
		your head in.

				JACK
		Hey, business is business.

	He turns to leave.  Susie's eyes narrow.

				SUSIE
		It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.

				JACK
		Just dinner and dance, right?


	INT.  DINING ROOM

	Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the
	smaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.  
	The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
	ignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.  
	Then Jack.  Then out the window.

				SUSIE
		Paradise.


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack and Frank's room.  It is New Year's Eve,
	just before show time, and Jack and Frank are in
	their tuxes.  Frank is on the phone.


				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Yes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the
		little glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.  
		It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything
		... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...
		Who? ... Well, we'll see.  Let me talk to Mommy,
		okay?... Okay,sweetheart.  Happy New Year.
			(waits)
		Hi, honey.  She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for
		Christmas.  Explain to her why we can't ... I don't
		know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.
		Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell
		her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?
		Without the training wheels?
			(affected by this)
		Well, that's great.  Tell him, tell him. I can't wait
		to see ... No, no new bike.  Maybe for his birthday ...
		Okay.  Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten
		minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...

	Frank sets the phone down and stares at it.  
	Jack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly
	claps his hands.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Well, let's go.  The public waits.


	INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A mass of swarming, jubilant people.  The voices are
	high and loud and there's not a hand without a
	champagne glass.  Couples lean into one another
	intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting
	strangers without hesitation.

				FRANK
			(yelling to be heard)
		All right, everyone.  This is it.
		Let's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...

	Gradually, the entire room joins the chant.

				FRANK/EVERYONE
		Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.
		Four.  Three.  Two!  ONE!
		HAPPY NEW YEAR!

	There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
	find that certain someone to kiss in the new year.  
	In this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves
	oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,
	their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.  
	Finally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,
	then goes to Jack.  They hesitate, then kiss lightly,
	pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's
	eyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne"
	and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place
	on the stage.  As she begins to sing, the others in the
	room, all intimate friends for one brief moment,
	begin to sing with her.

				SUSIE/EVERYONE
		Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...

	As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the
	sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear
	and we see:


	INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Jack, lying on his bed in the dark.  He opens his eyes,
	squinting against the light from the bathroom, then
	glances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline
	of a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the
	side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.
	Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
	the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast
	from the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack
	stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the
	bathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and
	gently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming
	murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  
	His back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is
	shaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees
	that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and
	gathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes
	up.  He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,
	then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom.  It is
	dark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed.  It's empty.


	INT.  DINING ROOM
	Dark and soundless.  Balloons, streamers and the other
	debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.  
	Frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at
	the ocean.  As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.

				FRANK
		Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.
		Happy New Year, little brother.

				JACK
		What're you doing down here?

				FRANK
		Celebrating.  Join me?

				JACK
		The party's over.

				FRANK
		No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning.
		Come on, have a drink.  
		Show your big brother how it's done.

	Frank pours him a glass.  Jack notices the bottle.

				JACK
		Expensive hangover.

				FRANK
		A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous
		hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.
			(toasting Jack)
		We, dear brother, are a fucking
		smash.
			(nodding)
		Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they
		have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.
		Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with
		Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais
		and everyone has a grand time crawling around on
		the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a
		dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in
		a different colored shell and at the end of the
		evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job
		to separate the yolks from the whites.
		Slippery business.

	Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then
	leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.
		Not once in twelve years.

	Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.

				FRANK
		The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?
		With the blue glass.

	Jack looks up at the chandelier.

				JACK
		The Royal.

				FRANK
		Right.  The Royal.  When's the
		last time we were there?

				JACK
		Couple years.

				FRANK
		February?

				JACK
		April.

				FRANK
		Right.  It's incredible how you
		do that.  Remember things.

				JACK
		A useless talent.

				FRANK
		Drove me crazy when we were kids.
		The way you never looked at the music.
		Miss Simpson would just play it and ...

	Frank snaps his fingers.

				JACK
		They were simple songs.

				FRANK
		Not for me.  I still have to look at the music
		sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget.
		I just forget.  But you.  You never forget.
		Ever.
			(turning)
		So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?

				JACK
		I told you.  It's a useless talent.

	Frank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the
	ocean.

				FRANK
		God, the old man would've loved
		this view, wouldn't he?

				JACK
		Yeah.

				FRANK
		I always think of him on New Year's.  
		How he used to pour us each half a can of beer.
		Remember?

				JACK
		You always threw up.

				FRANK
		Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.
		He loved that about you.

				JACK
		He was just having fun.

				FRANK
		It was like you'd passed some test,
		you know?

				JACK
		It was just a can of beer, Frank.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me
		anything.  Even though I was the oldest.  
		It was always you two, running off, doing things
		together.

				JACK
		You could've come.

				FRANK
		I could've.  But he didn't want
		me to.

				JACK
		You're making things up, Frank.

				FRANK
		Maybe so.
			(pause)
		You ever go back there?  Where it
		happened.

	Jack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the
	thick glass.

				JACK
		No.


	EXT.  HOTEL - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting outside the hotel,
	watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.  
	The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal
	to the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with
	a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
	tiny souvenir shot glass.

				FRANK
		Want one?

	Jack shakes his head.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Ah well, the kids'll break a
		couple anyway.

	Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the
	newlyweds are heard.

				BUD
		Give me the keys.

				HELEN
		You're not going to drive.

				BUD
		Give me the keys!

				HELEN
		You're not going to drive!

				BUD
		It's my goddamn car!

				HELEN
		It's our goddamn car!

				BUD
		Give me the keys.

				HELEN
		No.

	Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but
	she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.
	Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a
	madman, trying to catch her.  Finally, when he gets
	close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.

				FRANK
		I think I'll warm up the car.


	OVERVIEW - CITY

	Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite
	appealing after a week in paradise.


	INT. CAR - NIGHT

	The trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front
	of Jack's building.  It is very late.

				FRANK
		That takes care of this week.  The tenth we
		got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're
		at the Capri.

				JACK
		The tenth's out.

				FRANK
		What?

				JACK
		I can't make the tenth.

				FRANK
		What do you mean?

				JACK
		I mean maybe you should check with us before you
		go off and book us a month in advance.

				FRANK
		Be reasonable, Jack.

				JACK
		I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.
		How much more reasonable you expect me to be?

	Jack gets out of the car.  Frank shakes his head in
	exasperation, then looks to Susie.

				FRANK
		How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah
		this weekend?

				SUSIE
			(distracted)
		Huh?

				FRANK
		Forget it.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly.
	In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie,
	curled up on the couch, asleep.  Above them,
	hung carefully on a string, are some paper letters:
	"WELCOME HOME."


	INT.  LOUNGE

	In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
	several historical eras but which might best be described
	as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform
	"Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass
	in and out of view.

				SUSIE
		Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings
		... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...


	KITCHEN

	Jack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause.

				SUSIE
		I can't sing it anymore.

				FRANK
		What?

				SUSIE
		That song.  I can't sing it anymore.
		I'm gonna get sick.

				FRANK
		What're you talking about?  They
		love it.

				SUSIE
		I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.  
		Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?

				FRANK
			(as to a child)
		Susie.  It's one more show.  One
		more time.  That's all.

				SUSIE
		And two more times tomorrow night, and two more
		times the next night, and the next night and the
		next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't
		sing that fucking song anymore!

	She's yelling.  The kitchen workers are glancing over.
	Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		I need some air.


	EXT.  HOTEL

	A few minutes later.  Jack comes out of the hotel and
	sees Susie pacing.  
	He sits down and watches her for a moment.

				JACK
		You're gonna wear down those
		heels if you don't give it a rest.

		She stops.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Relax.  We'll drop the song.

				SUSIE
		Guess I got a little scattered.

				JACK
		It's a shitty  song.

	Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.

				SUSIE
		How do you do it? Every night?

				JACK
		Practice.
			(pause)
		There are worse songs, you know.
		Not many, but a few.

	Susie nods.  Jack studies her.  Something's on her
	mind.

				SUSIE
		Listen...
			(looks into his eyes)
		Nothing.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	A record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun
	goes down outside his window.  As we MOVE AWAY FROM
	the phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at
	the piano, playing along with the record,
	lost in concentration.


	EXT.  BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally
	glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be
	heard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette
	on the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others
	already there.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

	The record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,
	bumping into the label.  Jack glances at the clock next
	to him and gets up.  He puts on a jacket, then takes a
	pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.


	EXT.  BUILDING

	As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,
	surprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration
	he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the
	other end of the street.  Susie starts to call after
	him, but stops.


	EXT.  JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

	The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.  
	We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.


	INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where
	a trio is playing.  He has a drink in front of him,
	but it is untouched.  After a moment, the trio finishes
	and the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to
	the applause.


				HENRY
		Thank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake
		things up here every so often just to keep you
		people on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little
		rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit
		in.  He drops by about once a year just to keep
		his hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  
		Jack Baker.

	Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  
	As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,
	not moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they
	begin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  
	Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he
	plays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.


	EXT.  CLUB - NIGHT

	Later.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
	lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.

				SUSIE (O.S.)
		You were good.

	Jack stops.  Susie.

				JACK
		I can keep the beat.

				SUSIE
		Better than that.

	Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
	beginning to walk again.

				SUSIE
		What's the matter?

				JACK
		Nothing.

				SUSIE
		What'd I say?

				JACK
		Nothing.

				SUSIE
		You're upset.

				JACK
		I'm not upset.

				SUSIE
		All I said was you were good.

				JACK
			(stops)
		Look. You don't know good. All right?

				SUSIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				JACK
		It means you wouldn't know good
		if it came up and fucked you.

				SUSIE
		You were good.

				JACK
		Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

				SUSIE
		You were good.

				JACK
			(exasperated)
		How do you know?

				SUSIE
			(yelling)
		Because I saw the other people!
		And they knew you were good!
		You were good, goddamnit!

	Jack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment,
	they just stand on the corner, not talking.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So you wanna get a drink?


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT

				JACK
		Nina?

				SUSIE
		Who's Nina?

				JACK
		Friend.

				SUSIE
		Friend?  What's she look like?
		Maybe I can help you find her.

				JACK
		She's four feet tall.  Ed?

				SUSIE
		Ed? How many people live here?

	Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at
	Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen.

				JACK
		I have to make him some chili.
		Okay?

				SUSIE
			(a look)
		Sure.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER

	Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic
	as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window,
	the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming.

	Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
	about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as
	if they were veils.

				SUSIE
			(at window)
		Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it.  
		When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before
		the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a
		wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights
		of the city and string them into-a necklace for
		myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her
		eyes, I don't know, it was like she really
		believed it.

				JACK
		How come you didn't close your eyes?

	She looks surprised by the question.

				SUSIE
		I don't know.  I guess I didn't
		trust the night like she did.

	Susie finishes her drink and sets it down.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Let me have a cigarette, will you?  
		All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.

	Jack looks at her curiously.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Long story.

	Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You know, I saw you guys once.
		You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.

				JACK
		Must've been a cheap date.

				SUSIE
		Soap convention.

				JACK
		Soap?

				SUSIE
		Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At
		least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I
		was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The
		older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled
		the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...
			(shaking her head)
		Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you
		can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with
		him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.  
		But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with
		palms like a baby.

	Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		It wasn't so bad, though.  I'd get a nice piece of
		steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift.  Usually
		whatever the guy was into.  Got a socket set once.  
		Believe it?  The guy looked like held just given me
		four dozen roses.
			(almost wistful)
		But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see
		the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.  
		Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to
		believe sleeping in a room like that don't change
		your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but
		the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.
			(pause)
		I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...

	Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She
	looks out the window again.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.

	She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and
	nods to the phone booth.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		So what's this?

	Jack frowns, takes another drink.

				JACK
		History.

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				JACK
		My father proposed to my mother
		in there.

				SUSIE
		No kidding?

	It's a small phone booth.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The both of them?  In there?

				JACK
		He called her.

				SUSIE
		Oh. So what's it doing here?

				JACK
		Long story.

				SUSIE
		You sending me home?

	Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.

				JACK
		They'd been out dancing all night and he took
		her to the train station -- she lived over in
		Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this
		time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home,
		only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.

				SUSIE
		Nervous?

				JACK
		By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's
		got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the
		rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading
		about it in the morning edition.

				SUSIE
		You're kidding.

				JACK
		He had a mind that escalated things.

				SUSIE
		So, what happened?

				JACK
		He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks
		he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks
		he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing
		you know he's got his brothers down there and
		they're tearing the thing right off the curb.

	Susie blinks.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was
		gonna try and call her.

				SUSIE
		Wow.  But I still don't see how ...

				JACK
		Ma didn't want it around.  After.

				SUSIE
		Oh.

	Jack glances out the window.

				SUSIE
			(continuing, carefully)
		Frank said you saw him die.

	Jack glances up quickly, surprised.  He nods.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Frank said ---

				JACK
		Frank wasn't 'there.

	Susie stops, looks down.  Jack studies her for a moment,
	then decides.

				JACK
		He took me out to the docks one day.  We did that a
		lot.  There were other places, but he loved the ocean.
		He'd worked boats as a kid.  Never got rid of it.
		It was always in him.  He'd drink a little when we'd
		go.  If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.
		To make me laugh.
			(pause)
		He drank a lot that day.

	Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		There was a lot of wind.  He was up on this cargo
		shelf, right over the ocean.  And he started to
		do the jig.  One minute he was there ...
			(shrugs)
		I thought it was a joke at first.
		He did things like that.  Games.
			(pause)
		I was laughing when it happened.

	Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances
	up and catches Susie looking at him.

				JACK
		You got pretty eyes, you know that.


	INT.  JACK'S BEDROOM

	Jack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile,
	her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body
	falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.


	EXT.  JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,
	sleeping on the fire escape.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the
	window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one
	of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the
	doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink.

				JACK
		You gotta move 'em around if you want to
		play a song.

	Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano,
	pulls it away.

				SUSIE
		Oh. Hi.  Sorry.

				JACK
		Coffee?

				SUSIE
		Yeah... No.

				JACK
		Look, if you want to leave...

				SUSIE
		Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!

	Susie throws the cigarette out the window,
	then looks down.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Shit.  I think I started a fire.

				JACK
		If our feet get hot, you grab
		the piano.

	Susie smiles weakly.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Why don't you go.  I'll see you
		tomorrow night at the Ambassador.

	Susie doesn't move.

				SUSIE
		I followed you last night.  I
		mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was
		about to come up when you came out.

	Jack waits.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...
		I'm leaving.  The act.

	Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked
		my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat
		food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it?

	Susie tries a laugh.  Jack nods.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You can always get another girl.

				JACK
			(looks out window)
		There's always another girl.


	INT.  LOUNGE

	Jack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the
	manager.  Busboys move in and out, preparing the room
	for the evening.

				NICK
		Sick?  How sick?

				FRANK
		The flu.

				NICK
		So she's got a few sniffles.

				FRANK
		Doctor's orders.

	Nick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room.

				NICK
		You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.  
		It's unethical.

				FRANK
		Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.

				NICK
		What am I gonna do?  Put a record
		player out there?
			(exiting)
		Bad, Frankie.  Bad.

				JACK
			(to Frank)
		What're you doing?

				FRANK
		Just until we find another girl.

				JACK
		Cancel, Frank.

				FRANK
		You want to know how much I got tied up in
		deposits with Willie?  We're in for three
		weeks solid, Jack.

				JACK
		Better give her pneumonia.


	INT.  BACK ROOM

	Jack and Frank find themselves in the back room of
	Willie's again.  They do not look happy.

				GIRL (O.S.)
		Remember me?

	Jack and Frank look up.  A girl in a yellow and black
	dress is in the doorway.  She looks like a bumblebee.

				GIRL
		Monica.  Monica Moran.  I came in the last time
		you guys were looking for a singer.
			(smiling)
		Perseverance.  First rule of show business.

	Jack and Frank just stare at her.

				MONICA (GIRL)
		I bought a book.  That's what it says.


	EXT.  WILLIE'S - LATER

	Frank is looking at a list.

				FRANK
		We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a
		couple of weeks.  Larry Shelton said he'd let me
		know by Friday on the Ambassador.  That's it.

	Frank folds the paper carefully.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I got some calls out.  Things
		that might be good for us.

	Frank looks over at Jack for the first time.  He's
	leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		We'll try for a girl again next
		week.

	Jack nods.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Okay.  Well, the Roosevelt then.


	INT.  ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE

	Once grand, now dark and dusty looking.  A small crowd.

				FRANK
		You know, my brother and I have been playing
		together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?

				JACK
		Twenty-eight years.

	No response.  Bored, brutally indifferent faces.

				FRANK
		Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little
		different.  We were just kids.  Just about the
		only one who would listen to us was the family
		cat, Cecil.  We must've shaved three lives off old
		Cecil, huh, Jack?

	Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the
	microphone, is the only sound in the room.

				FRANK
			(continuing; hanging tough)
		Yeah, well, anyway.  It's nice to be back here in
		the Roosevelt Room, because this has always
		been ...

	Frank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and
	seat herself at a table in the back of the room.
	Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		a very special place for Jack and I.
			(recovering)
		And tonight we'd like to open with a very special
		song.  It's the song my mother and father danced 
		to the night they were married.  This is for them.


	INT.  LOBBY

	Jack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug.

				FRANK
		You should've told us you were coming, Ma.  
		We would've come and got you.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Spur of the moment.

				FRANK
		So what'd you think?

				MRS.  BAKER
		Thrilling.
			(glancing at Jack)
		Both of you.

				FRANK
		The audience was a little off
		tonight.

				MRS.  BAKER
		A few empty tables.  It's cozier.  
		Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place
		on a Wednesday night.

				FRANK
		I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we
		get a little midnight snack?  
		Theo's should still be open.

				MRS.  BAKER
		No, no.  You boys are tired.

				FRANK
		No, we're not.  Jack?

				JACK
		No.

				MRS.  BAKER
		I'm tired.  Really.  I should get
		home.

				FRANK
		You sure?

				MRS.  BAKER
			(nodding)
		Just call me a cab.

				FRANK
		A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half
		block down.  You wait here.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(smiling)
		All right.

	Frank dashes out of the lobby.  Jack and Mrs. Baker
	watch him go, then turn to each other.  Mrs. Baker smiles
	awkwardly, then surveys the lobby.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

	The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -
	once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation -
	look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an
	elegant dignity.

				JACK
		Yeah.


				MRS.  BAKER
		This was quite,a place once.  After the war.  On
		Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom
		upstairs.  It was beautiful.  Crystal chandeliers.
		White tablecloths.  Orchids floating in the punch
		bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.

	Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room.
	After a moment, she nods toward the lounge.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		It went well tonight.

				JACK
		Frank works hard.

				MRS.  BAKER
		And you don't?

				JACK
		He leads, I follow.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Is that the way it is?

				JACK
		Pretty much.

				MRS.  BAKER
		He mentioned you had a girl for
		a while.  A singer.

				JACK
		For a while.  She left.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Yes, well, it's probably best.
		No sense bringing someone else in.

				JACK
		I suppose.

	Mrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Funny.  Watching tonight, I was
		remembering when you were young.
		How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to
		the two of you practice while I did the dishes.
			(smiling)
		My two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to
		the door and just watch.  Sometimes your father
		would too.
			(pause)
		He liked to listen to you play.
		Did you know that?

	Jack shakes his head.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		You miss him, don't you?

				JACK
		It's been a long time, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		I supposed you still have that old phone booth.

	Jack nods.  Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		His love scared me, you know.  The day he died he
		 left a flower on my pillow.

	Jack looks puzzled.  Suddenly his mother reaches out
	and very gently touches her fingers to his face.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		You look so like him.

	They stand like this for a moment, connnected, then
	Frank steps in from the street.

				FRANK
		Your limo's ready, Ma.

				MRS.  BAKER
		All right.

	Mrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns
	away.  Just before she exits, she looks back.

				MRS.  BAKER
			(continuing)
		Good night, Jack.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.
	Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says
	a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the
	arm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat,
	then follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he
	reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.
	Not Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.  
	For a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of
	her elbow.

				JACK
		Sorry.


	INT.  CAR - NIGHT

	A few nights later.  Frank guides the car through wet
	city streets.  It's two AM and raining hard.

				JACK
		We're not getting paid then.

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
		Nothing. We get nothing.

				FRANK
		I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon.
		No one gets a cent.

				JACK
			(a pause)
		What's it for?

				FRANK
		I don't know. Some disease.

				JACK
		What disease?

				FRANK
		I don't know.

				JACK
		You don't know?

				FRANK
		It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it.
		It's not a moral decision.

				JACK
			(another pause)
		What channels it on?

				FRANK
		Seventy-one

				JACK
		Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?

				FRANK
			(defensive)
		A channel.  
		It's just a little further down the dial, that's all.
		Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

	Jack stares at Frank.

				JACK
		Right.


	INT.  HALLWAY

	Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway.

				FRANK
		The guy said to find Studio E and
		turn right.  What's that say?

	Suddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through
	the corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge
	YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.

				YOUTH
		Fast break!

	Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it
	around the corner.

				FRANK
		I guess it's that way.


	INT.  STUDIO

	Jerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil
	and crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the "phone
	bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,
	in makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board,
	set on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,
	at 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid
	in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the
	camera.

				FRANK
		This must be it.  I'll see when
		we're on.

	Frank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's
	walked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset
	MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the
	sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.

				EARL (MAN)
		You the magician?

				JACK
		No.

				EARL
			(disappointed)
		Oh.  What do you do?

	Jack points to the pianos across the room.

				JACK
		Piano.

				EARL
			(hopeful)
		Two at a time?

				JACK
		My brother and I. One each.

				EARL
			(disappointed again)
		Oh.

				JACK
			(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)
		What's wrong with the kid?


				EARL
		Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right
		before the accident.

				JACK
		Accident?

				EARL
		The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to
		buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.

		As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank
		returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.

				FRANK
		We're on after Meadowlark.
			(seeing Jack's face)
		What's wrong?

				JACK
		Are you kidding me?  Are you
		fucking kidding me?

				FRANK
		What?

				JACK
		We're playing for a goddamn
		gymnasium!

				FRANK
			(worried)
		What?

	Before Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the
	wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux
	strides in front of the camera.  He's VINCE NANCY,
	the host.

				VINCE
		Let's hear it for our own Jimmy
		Marshall, shall we?

	The audience applauds.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist
		on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant
		High this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us
		Jimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...
		if there is a next season.
			(Uncle Sam)
		That's where you come in.  Pick up that phone.  
		Make a donation.  Let's keep our kids off the
		streets and in the gym where they belong.

	Applause.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		All right.  Well, friends, what can I say about
		our next guest?
			(consulting a card)
		He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with
		us two of the most respected men in the musical
		entertainment field.  I think you'll agree with me
		when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I
		say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker
		Boys!  Come on out here guys.

	Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and
	Frank enter from the right.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Whoops, there they are.  Hey, nice
		suits, fellas.
			(to camera)
		Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out
		there are going to want to rap with these guys and
		don't worry.  Right after they finish up here,
		they're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we
		can even convince them to raffle off a few piano
		lessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?

	The audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Well, all right then.  What are we
		waiting for?  Take it away, guys.

	Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and
	begin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes
	very quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank
	are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously
	LOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out
	again.

				VINCE
			(continuing)
		Uh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's
		time to turn the board over.
			(to Jack, Frank)
		I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.  
		Let's bring out the board.

	Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board
	right in front of Jack and Frank.  
	Jack looks positively homicidal.

				FRANK
		Jack ...

	Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.  
	Then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the
	basketball and fires it at Vince.

				VINCE
		What the --

				JACK
			(pointing)
		You're a fucking creep, you know
		that.  I oughta kick your ass.

				FRANK
			(whispering)
		Jack, you're on television.

				JACK
		Shut up, Frank.

	Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on
	Jack's shoulder.

				EARL
		What do you say we go for a walk,
		pal.

				JACK
		Get your hand off me.

				EARL
		Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you.  
		Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget
		what you're angry about.

				JACK
		Go fuck yourself.

				EARL
			(eyes go hard)
		You're a real tough guy when the
		ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?

				JACK
		I don't see any ladies here.
		Except maybe you.

	That does it.  Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and
	starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door.

				FRANK
		Hey, leave him alone.

				EARL
		Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.

				JACK
		You're a lousy dancer, Earl.  Don't
		you know the man's supposed to lead?

	Earl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard.  
	Jack stumbles back against the wall.

				EARL
		Who do you think you are, asshole?
		Liberace?


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.  
	Frank follows a few yards behind.

				FRANK
		Jack.  We just,passed the car. Jack.  This is a
		tuxedo.  Three hundred dollars.
			(pause)
		You gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous
		silent act?  Look, it was for publicity.  
		Do you understand?  Publicity.

	Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.

				JACK
		What-are you?  A fucking moron?
		It's three o'clock in the morning,
		Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?
		Maybe you can get us a gig playing
		Little Frank's birthday party.
		What do you think?

				FRANK
		Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on
		until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?  
		I had the pianos anyway.

				JACK
		Basketballs, Frank.  You had us
		playing for basketballs.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed
		up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle
		of a gig.

				JACK
			(incredulous)
		What?

				FRANK
		It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.  
		A stupid-ass stunt.

	Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.

				JACK
		What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing
		ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let
		that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were
		always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.  
		What's happened to your dignity?

				FRANK
		Dignity?  Who the hell are you to
		talk about dignity?

	Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's
	jacket, coming away with a bottle.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		This where you get your dignity, Jack?  
		This is where you get your courage?

	Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		No, let's do it straight for
		once, shall we?

	Frank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it
	SHATTERS.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Let me explain something to you, little brother.  
		See, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got
		a wife and two children who expect to wake up every
		morning with food on the table and heat in the house.  
		I got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's
		medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  
		Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so
		fucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't
		you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes
		and blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  
		But I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little
		brother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out
		in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go
		on living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,
		but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I
		folded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,
		little brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.

	Jack stares at Frank through the rain,
	then turns and begins to walk away.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Great.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,
		Jack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another
		bottle of courage on your way home.
			(pause)
		That's what he'd do.

	Jack stops, his back to Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You've found the perfect solution to all the
		pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?  
		Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or
		night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.  
		You're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.

	Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.

				JACK
		Stay off it.

				FRANK
		No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of
		watching you make him up into some kinda god.  
		For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid
		bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He
		wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.

				JACK
			(eerily cold)
		You weren't there.

				FRANK
		That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the
		luxury of being a witness to tragedy.

				JACK
			(coiled)
		Fuck you.

				FRANK
		No, fuck you.  And fuck him too.
		Fuck the both-of you.

	Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the
	lapels.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, what're you doing?  Hey!

	Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling
	and slamming him in a fitful rage.

				FRANK
			(continuing; scared)
		Jack! ... Jack! ...

	Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect
	himself.  Jack hovers over him.

				JACK
		How's it feel to have your little brother beat
		the shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!

	Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.  
	Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,
	and catches a blow on his fingers.

				FRANK
		My hands!  My hands!

	Jack grabs one of Frank's hands.

				JACK
			(mocking)
		Your hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue
		ribbon on amateur night.

	Jack bends back Frank's fingers.

				FRANK
			(terrified)
		Jack!

				JACK
		Who's weak now, big brother?

	Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.

				FRANK
		Jack!  JACK!

	Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  
	Suddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still
	clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior
	as Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks
	at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped
	and dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split
	and bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks
	hollow, frightened.

				JACK
		I'm through with it.  I can't do
		it anymore.

	Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack
	just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and
	disappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive
	solo piano.  And we see:


	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain
	over now.

	Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the
	dim glow of the streetlights.

	Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing
	there.  Alone.

	Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off
	the engine.

	Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.

	Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as
	the sun begins to come up.

	Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.


	INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

	The next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill,
	watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone
	across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes
	to the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.  
	It rings.  Again.  Again.

				CINDY (V.0.)
		Hello?

	Jack blinks.  It's Cindy.

				CINDY
		Hello ... Hellooooo ...
			(fainter)
		Daddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the
		phone and they won't talk.

	Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle.


	INT.  BAR

	Jack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the
	light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.  
	A big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
	talking to Jack.

				MAN
		If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.  
		If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.  
		If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.  
		That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I
		send you home.  Okay?

	Jack nods and points to the piano in the corner.

				JACK
		That it?

				MAN
		How many you need?

	Jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.

				JACK
		It's out of tune.

				MAN
		Trust me, the way I fix a martini,
		it'll be in tune.

	The MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE

	Frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother
	and sister tandem who would be better served by an
	obedience school.  While the little girl pounds
	incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles
	around the room, destroying everything in sight.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


	EXT.  STREET
	Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner
	where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.

	MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:


	INT.  BAR

	Jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing
	throughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight
	and the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain
	at the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers.  
	As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.  
	There is a glass on the piano with money in it.

				SUSIE (O.S.)
		I thought the Bakers didn't take
		tips.

	Jack glances up, but he knows the voice.

				JACK
		I give it all to charity.

	Susie nods.

				SUSIE
		Saw the sign outside.  Got your
		own sign, huh?

				JACK
		Yeah.  Got my own sign.

				SUSIE
		So ... ?

				JACK
		We outgrew each other.

				SUSIE
		Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't
		figure.  You two.

				JACK
		You don't pick your brother.

				SUSIE
		Yeah.

				JACK
		So how's the cat food business?

				SUSIE
		Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.

	Jack nods.

				JACK
		What kind?

				SUSIE
		Huh?

				JACK
		Vegetables.

				SUSIE
		Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of
		the important ones.

	Susie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new
		place.  Or we could go to a bar ...
			(looking around)
		Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know
		a place uptown, if you want --

				JACK
		I've given it up.

	Susie stops.

				SUSIE
		No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a
		reunion over tomato juice, can you?
			(pause)
		Anyway, if you're ever in the
		neighborhood ... I wrote it down.

	Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands
	it to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Tell egghead I said hi.  If you
		see him.

				JACK
		If I see him.

	Susie nods and walks toward the door.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Hey.
			(as she stops)
		You got pretty eyes.

	Susie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip
	of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  
	He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's
	wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.


	INT.  FRANK'S DEN

	Frank sits alone in the darkness of the den.  The
	cardboard stand-up is there, along with several old
	photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in
	tuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee.  After a moment,
	Donna enters.

				DONNA
		Frank?  It's late, honey.

	Frank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Mrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make
		his lesson tomorrow.

	Donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the
	photograph in his hand.

				FRANK
		You know how good he is?  It's like breathing
		with him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,
		looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.  
		Maybe it's worse.  For him.
			(gesturing to the piano)
		It's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.  
		But when I was up there with him...
		It was like I had the gift, too.


	INT.  FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY

	Frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning
	against the bathroom door.  It's locked.

				FRANK
		Come on, Jeremy.  Open the door.

	Somewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.  
	Frank ignores it.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Jeremy.  You want me to call your father?  
		He's not going to be very happy when he hears
		he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you
		to sit on the toilet.

	Donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.

				DONNA
		Honey ...

				FRANK
		You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm
		playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next
		thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.  
		There's nothing sharp in there, is there?

				DONNA
		Honey ...

				FRANK
		Where are our kids?  
		Has he got one of them in there?

				DONNA
		Frank.

	Frank finally looks at his wife.  She's crying.


	INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the
	nurses station.  As he moves to the counter, Donna
	appears.

				JACK
		Donna.  Where is she?

	Donna just shakes her head.

				DONNA
		We tried the apartment, but after
		that we didn't know where to call.

	Jack looks frozen.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Frank'll be back in a moment.  
		He took Little Frank to the bathroom.

	Jack begins to back away slowly.

				DONNA
			(continuing)
		Jack ...

	EXT.  STREET

	Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in
	and out of shadows.  Finally he stops inside a closed
	storefront, his back up against the window, and looks
	down at his hands.  They're shaking.


	INT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY

	Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.  
	After a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.

				SUSIE
		Jack.

				JACK
		Hi.

				SUSIE
		Well, this is some surprise.
			(seeing his face)
		Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.

	Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Jack?

	Jack looks up.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		You want to come in?

	He nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Let me get the light.

				JACK
		No.

	He stares directly into her eyes.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Leave it dark.


	INT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

	Jack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down
	at Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her
	face as if looking for something, then takes his coat
	and begins to leave.

				SUSIE
		I used to do that.

	Jack turns.  Susie is looking at him.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could
		wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on
		the other end of it, though.

				JACK
		I didn't want to wake you.

				SUSIE
			(smiling slightly)
		Yeah.

				JACK
		Thanks.  For letting me in last night.

				SUSIE
		Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.  
		Like a song.

	Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and
	turns for the door.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Hey.

	Jack stops, his hand on the doorknob.

				SUSIE
			(continuing)
		Am I gonna see you again?

	Jack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.

				JACK
		Yeah.  You're gonna see me again.

	Susie smiles slightly.

				SUSIE
		Okay.


	EXT.  STREET

	Jack is standing across the street from his mother's
	house, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the
	street.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of
	the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,
	kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
	cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the
	damage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his
	fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks
	toward the house.


	EXT.  HOUSE

	Through the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING
	sound and see partially into the front door.  Half
	the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.  
	He opens the door and enters.


	INT.  HOUSE

	Inside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a
	completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.  
	Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely
	into shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of
	ghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the
	kitchen.


	INT.  KITCHEN

	As Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching
	through a cabinet.  He watches for a moment.

				JACK
		What're you looking for?

	Frank turns quickly, surprised.

				FRANK
		I didn't hear you come in.

				JACK
		What're you doing?

				FRANK
	Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But
	it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of
	cooking sherry.

	Jack nods.  Frank looks nervous.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd
		want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.  
		If you want to get started.

				JACK
		Later.

	Frank nods.  Silence.

				JACK
			(continuing)
		Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.

				FRANK
		Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.  
		She and Dad had taken care of it.

				JACK
		Right.

				FRANK
		I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're
		doing the stone today.
			(pause)
		It's okay?  Wednesday?

				JACK
		Yeah, fine.

				FRANK
		There's not going to be a viewing.
		I figured with the kids and all ...

				JACK
		Sure.

	Jack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls.  
	Handmade curtains, lightly faded.

				FRANK
		It's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the
		house seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep
		up with it. I keep losing my wind.

	Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a
	moment.

				FRANK
			(continuing;glancing away)
		God, I could use a drink.

	Jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Oh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.

	Frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Damn.  Donna must've packed
		them up this morning.

	Jack holds out the bottle.

				JACK
		Go ahead.

				FRANK
		No.

				JACK
			(showing the seal is unbroken)
		Bought it on the way over.  Clean
		as a nun.

				FRANK
		No, it's not that.  I ... can't
		drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.

				JACK
		Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.

	Frank looks embarrassed.

				FRANK
			(remembering)
		Oh, hey, I want to show you
		something.  Come on.

	Jack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank
	stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
	gestures Jack to the other.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hit the C. Go ahead.

	Jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank
	does the same.  Jack glances up in surprise.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		I'm right, aren't I? They're
		in tune.

	Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		All these years.  She kept them in tune.  
		Can you imagine?  
		Now why would she do something like that?

	Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  
	Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
	glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a
	different hotel.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have
		that drink after all.
			(picking up a few glasses)
		What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  
		We got the Travelodge on Route 41.  
		And ... the Mallory.

				JACK
		I'll take the Mallory.

				FRANK
		Good choice.

	Frank blows some dust off the glasses.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Looks like these got a few years on them.

				JACK
		This'll kill 'em.

	Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano
	benches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.

				FRANK
		Jesus.

	It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old
	familiar place, staring into his glass.

				JACK
		How're your hands?

				FRANK
			(surprised)
		Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple
		sore knuckles.  Nothing.

				JACK
		You know, that night, I ... It
		just all came up.

				FRANK
		Yeah, I know.  Me, too.

				JACK
		I mean, you can play.  You're
		okay.

				FRANK
			(smiling)
		I can keep the beat.

	Jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		Charlie called.

				JACK
		Yeah?

				FRANK
		Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  
		Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.  
		Nothing like a little absence to make the heart
		grow fonder, huh?

				JACK
		Yeah.

	Jack and Frank lock eyes again.  
	Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass.

				FRANK
		Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?

				JACK
		Five years ago.
			(thinking)
		November.

				FRANK
		Right.  It was someone's birthday.
		Halloran?

				JACK
		Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.

				FRANK
		Christ, that's right.  How could
		I forget.  What a nightmare.

				JACK
		She asked for it.

				FRANK
		I told Halloran we didn't do
		vocals, but he said:

				JACK AND FRANK
			(in unison)
		What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.

				JACK
		She got it all right.

	Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy
	mischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel
	on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen."

				JACK AND FRANK
			(singing)
		She comes on like a dream
		Peaches and cream
		Lips like strawberry wine
		She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.
		Ribbons and curls
		Ooh, what a girl
		Eyes that sparkle and shine
		You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.

	As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a
	moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  
	Full of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before
	him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is
	quiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.

				FRANK
		Well ... One more time?

	Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass
	held out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.

				JACK
		One more time.
Family Man

 

		CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

	1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

		SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

		A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
		London.

		JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
		Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
		eyes... sitting next to...

		KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
		rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

					KATE
			I got you a few necessities...

		Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats 
		Cradle.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			Your copy was a mess...

		Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes 
		off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Every one of these songs will 
			remind you of me in a slightly 
			different way...

					JACK
			All in one tape?

					KATE
			I also put side two of London 
			Calling on there...

		Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
		lips.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			That was not officially the 
			goodbye kiss. It was just an 
			interim kiss...

		He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
		close, kissing her deeply. Then...

					ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
			This will be the final boarding 
			call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
			London, Heathrow.

		Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
		the gate.

					KATE
			You have your ticket?

		Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
		nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

					JACK
			Im not even gonna say it, 
			Kate. Maybe itll be like 
			I never left...

		Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
		gate.

		Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

		...a  moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She 
		looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
		trying to decide...

					KATE
			Wait.

		Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I have a bad feeling about 
			this.

					JACK
			About the plane? What do you 
			think its gonna crash? Dont 
			say that...

					KATE
				(shaking her head)
			I know weve talked about this a 
			thousand times and we both agree 
			that going to London is the 
			right thing to do. But in my 
			heart... this feels wrong.

		She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
		then back into Jacks eyes.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont  go, Jack...

					JACK
			You mean dont go at all?  
			What about my internship?

					KATE
			Believe me I know what an 
			incredible opportunity this 
			is for you...

					JACK
			For us, Kate.

					KATE
			Right, for us. But...Im
			afraid that if you get on 
			that plane...

					JACK
			What?

		Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant 
		say...

					KATE
				(torn)
			Go. Im sorry, you should just 
			go...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			No, youre right.  What are we 
			doing?

					KATE
			We're being responsible.  Go.
			Get on the plane.

		His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

					KATE (CONT'D)
				(a smile)
			Get the hell outta my sight.
			You bother me.

		A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
		nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
		Jack.

					JACK
				(resolute)
			Okay, I'm going...

		He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
		tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
		disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

					KATE
			I can't seem to let go of
			you...

					JACK
			You hear me complaining about
			that?

		A sober look in Jack's eyes.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			Look, we're at the airport and
			no one ever thinks clearly at
			the airport so we should just
			trust the decision we already
			made.  You've been accepted to
			one of the best law schools in
			the country, I've got this
			internship at Barclay's Bank.
			We have a great plan, honey...

		Kate nods, then, with resolve...

					KATE
			You want to do something
			great, Jack?  Let's flush the
			plan...start our lives right
			now, today...I don't know what
			that life's gonna look like
			but I do know it has both of
			us in it.  And I choose us...

		Jack is jolted by her words.

					KATE (CONT'D)
			The plan doesn't make us
			great, Jack.  What we have
			together, that's what makes us
			great.

		Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
		looks toward the gate, only one person left in
		line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

		Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

					JACK
			I love you, Kate...

		...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(taking her face in
				 his hands)
			...and a year in London's not
			gonna change that.  A hundred
			years couldn't change that...

		Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
		the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
		look back.

		Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
		the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
		willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
		doesn't...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    1A	EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

		The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
		Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
		Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

	2	EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

		We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
		building...

	3	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
		moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
		behind it...

		The place looks like a museum display...everything is
		of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

		A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
		Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

		And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

	4	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

		Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
		mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
		A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
		shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
		where he sees...

		A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
		back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
		curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
		turns to him...

		PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
		mouth...

					PAULA
				(holding up toothbrush)
			   I hope you don't mind.  There
			   were like ten new ones in the
			   cabinet.

		A playful smile from Paula.

					JACK
			   It's not what you think.  I
			   took Mentadent public...

		Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
		black dress hanging neatly over it.

					PAULA
			   Did you really mean what you
			   said about Tuscany?

					JACK
			   Of course I did.

					PAULA
			   Last night was great...

					JACK
			   You are an amazing lover.  You
			   should be giving motivational
			   seminars.

					PAULA
			   Thanks.  You're not bad
			   yourself...

		Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
		stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
		slips the dress on.

					JACK
			   I want to see you again.

					PAULA
			   I'd like that, too.

			JACK
			   Tonight.

		She turns to him.

					PAULA
			   It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

					JACK
			   So we'll get egg nog.

		Paula laughs.

					PAULA
				(putting on her shoes)
			   I have to go to my parents'
			   house out in Jersey.  Would
			   you like to come?

					JACK
			   Jersey?  You know what the
			   traffic's gonna be like?

					PAULA
			   I'm taking the train...

		Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
		dangling on his chest.

					PAULA (CONT'D)
			   Don't you have anywhere to go?

					JACK
			   I've got plenty of places to
			   go.

		He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
		answer...

					PAULA
				(a sexy laugh, then...)
			   Maybe I can try and sneak away
			   some time tomorrow morning...
				(kissing him on 
				 the lips)
			   Okay?

					JACK
				(coy)
			   If it's something you feel
			   strongly about.
 
		Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

					PAULA
			It was nice meeting you, Jack...

		CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - MORNING

		Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
		living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

		...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
		hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
		enveloped in music...

    4B	INT. JACKS BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

		Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
		emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance 
		back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

	5	INT. JACKS BATHROOM - MORNING

		Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring 
		through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
		orchestra...

		Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
		tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
		Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

	6	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MORNING

		...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
		suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
		shirts everywhere.

		Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
		front of a mirror.

	7	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

		Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and 
		carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the 
		Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
		from memory...

		The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
		singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
		coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

					JACK
				(a charming smile)
			   Mrs. Peterson.

					MRS. PETERSON
			   Hello Jack.  You dont 
			   have to stop singing on 
			   my account...

					JACK
			   Its because Im shy, 
			   Betty.  So, when are you 
			   going to leave that old 
			   corpse Mr. Peterson and 
			   run away with me?

					MRS. PETERSON
			   You know you could never 
			   satisfy me the way he 
			   does...

		The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
		ahead.

	8	INT. JACKS BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

		TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
		Peterson...

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Merry Christmas, Mr. 
			   Campbell.

					JACK
			   Howd you do this year, 
			   Tony?

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   About four grand.  And a 
			   bottle of twenty five 
			   year old scotch from Mrs. 
			   Johnson in 9D.  Im 
			   putting it all in 
			   commercial paper like you 
			   said.

					JACK
			   Just until the Deutsche 
			   Mark turns...

		Jack exits the building...

	9   OMITTED

    9A	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...

    10	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

		A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
		glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
		Investment House.

		The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
		into the building...

    10A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
		smile on his way to the elevators...

		CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

		DISSOLVE TO:

    11	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

		The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
		this beautiful conference room.

		SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
		with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
		table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
		look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
		of him.

		Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
		small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
		the table.

		Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
		room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
		screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

					JACK
			   ...if MedTech's shares sink
			   any lower than...
				(casually executing 
				 a keystroke)
			   ...forty three, we're in
			   trouble with the stock
			   valuation.  So for god's sake
			   watch what you say to your
			   institutional customers...

		Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   ...we still have almost a full
			   day of trading before zero
			   hour and I don't want any
			   trouble...
				(distracted by Mintz)
			   ...penny for your thoughts,
			   Alan...

		Alan looks up.

					ALAN
			   Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
			   the kids I'd be home by
			   dinner.  You know, it being
			   Christmas Eve and all.

					JACK
			   Is that tonight?

		A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   You think I like being here on
			   Christmas Eve, Alan?

					ALAN
			   I don't know.  Maybe...

		Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
		chuckle.

					JACK
			   Okay, maybe I do have a touch
			   of tunnel vision this holiday
			   season.  But in two days we're
			   going to announce one of the
			   largest mergers in U.S.
			   corporate history.  Thirty
			   billion dollars...
				(basking in the glory)
			   When this kind of deal turns
			   up you get on and you ride it
			   `till it's over.  You don't
			   ask it for a vacation...

		A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
		energize Jack.

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(to the group)
			   December 26th.  After that
			   there'll be so much money
			   floating around here it'll be
			   like Christmas every day...
				(smiling)
			   December 26th, people.  If
			   you'd like to celebrate that
			   day, you all have my
			   blessing...

		Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
		around the table...

					ALAN
			   You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
			   Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK
			   I don't want you to be sorry,
			   Alan, I want you to be
			   excited.  I want my gift to be
			   the first one you open this
			   year.  You know why?

					ALAN
			   Why Jack?

					JACK
			   Because my gift comes with ten
			   zeroes at the end...

		A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
		smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Good man...

    12	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

		The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
		SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
		messages.

		Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
		ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
		messages.

					ADELLE
			   Only eight thirty?  What's the
			   matter, had some last minute
			   shopping to do?

		Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
		hands him his messages.

					JACK
			   You too?  This holiday's about
			   giving, Adelle.  And I'm
			   giving everything I've got to
			   this deal, so in a way, I'm
			   more Christmassy than
			   anyone...
				(holding out the candy)
			   Lifesaver?

					ADELLE
				(ignoring the candy)
			   You're a ray of sunshine,
			   Jack.

		They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
		President" stenciled on the glass...

    13	INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
		messages, and into Jack's office...

    14	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
		high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
		Stairmaster...

		Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
		down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

					ADELLE
			   Oh, and Oxxford called...

					JACK
			   Ooh, my suits are ready...

		He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
		reels back.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Kate Reynolds...

					ADELLE
			   Her assistant said you could
			   call her at home after eight.

		Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
		ghost.

					JACK
			   Her assistant?

					ADELLE
			   Yeah Jack, her assistant...

					JACK
				(lost in the message)
			   Kate Reynolds was my
			   girlfriend in college.  I
			   almost married her...

					ADELLE
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You?  Married?

					JACK
				(snapping out of it)
			   Almost married.  And almost a
			   junior broker at E.F.
			   Hutton...

					ADELLE
			   Excuse me?

					JACK
			   She didn't want me to go to
			   London.  We're standing at the
			   airport saying goodbye and she
			   asks me to stay.

					ADELLE
			   So you left her?  Just like
			   that?

					JACK
			   God, no.  I thought about it
			   for practically the entire
			   flight...

					ADELLE
			   Stop Jack, I'm getting all
			   weepy.

					JACK
			   I took the road less traveled,
			   Adelle.

					ADELLE
			   And look where it's led you...
				(picking up the phone)
			   I'm gonna get her on the
			   phone...

		Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
		back...

		Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
		reaches out and hangs up the phone.

					JACK
			   No...

					ADELLE
			   No?!  You almost married this
			   woman.  Aren't you even
			   curious what she wants?

					JACK
			   She's probably just having a
			   fit of nostalgia.  You know,
			   lonely Christmas Eve, call the
			   one that got away, that kind
			   of thing.

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   I'm telling you, it's ancient
			   history...

		Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
		chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
		the room.

					LASSITER
			   Eight forty-five on Christmas
			   Eve and Jack Campbell is still
			   at his desk.  There's a
			   Hallmark moment for you...

		Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
		times.

					JACK
			   Peter.  I don't see you
			   rushing home to trim the tree.

					LASSITER
				(pouring himself 
				 a scotch)
			   That's because I'm a heartless
			   bastard who only cares about
			   money.

					JACK
			   And God love you for it.

		Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
		Jack.

					LASSITER
				(sipping the scotch)
			   I just got a call from Terry
			   Haight.  Bob Thomas is
			   nervous...

					JACK
			   That'll happen when you're
			   about to spend thirty billion
			   dollars on some aspirin...

					LASSITER
			   Someone's gonna have to nurse
			   him through this.

					JACK
			   Why are you staring at my
			   breasts, Peter?

					LASSITER
			   I need you, tiger..

					JACK
			   Where is he?

					LASSITER
			   Aspen.

		Jack pauses for a beat.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
			   won't be able to make it
			   tomorrow...

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

					LASSITER
			   You're a credit to capitalism,
			   Jack.

		Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

					JACK
			   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
			   question.  An old girlfriend
			   calls you out of the blue on
			   Christmas Eve...

					LASSITER
			   You suddenly having trouble
			   getting dates?

					JACK
			   Not by a long shot.

					LASSITER
			   Then leave it in the past.
			   Old flames are like old tax
			   returns.  You keep `em in the
			   file cabinet for three years
			   and then you cut `em loose.

		Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
		Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
		Knicks hoop.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   I'll leave from the office
			   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
			   group.  Schedule an emergency
			   strategy session for noon.

					ADELLE
			   That'll be a nice little
			   holiday treat.

    15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		A single light remains on in the building.

    16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

		Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
		checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

		Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
		checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
		to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
		glory, then he see it...

		...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
		trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
		the night...

    17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
		desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
		monitors.

					FRANK
			   Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
			   call down, I would've had Joe
			   get your ride.

		Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
		street.

					JACK
			   I'm thinking I might walk
			   tonight, Frank.

					FRANK
			   Nice night for it.  I'll have
			   Louis send your car home.

		A nod from Jack.

					FRANK (CONT'D)
			   Merry Christmas to you, sir...

					JACK
			   Thanks.  To you too...

		Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
		out into the crisp night air...

    18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

		Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
		large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
		falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
		the windows of the closed shops along the way.

		He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
		Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

		He heads toward it...

    20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
		Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

		SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
		behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
		salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
		liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

		...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
		"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
		coffee machine...

					CASH
			   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
			   a certified winner...paper-
			   thin but good as gold...

		Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

		Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

					JACK
			   Egg nog?

					SAM WONG
				(pointing)
			   Dairy case.  Five dollar.

					CASH
				(in the b.g., to 
				 Sam Wong)
			   Y'all do the lotto here...?
			   `Cause I got me a winner...I
			   know, I know, Lotto keeps the
			   black man down... but not
			   me...

		Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
		handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
		the counter...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   ...06...14...18...48...right
			   there.  Four numbers...that's
			   two hundred and thirty eight
			   dollar...
				(a smile)
			   Merry Christmas and shit...

					SAM WONG
				(barely looking 
				 at ticket)
			   Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
			   with pencil.

					CASH
			   What're you talkin' about?

					SAM WONG
				(throwing the ticket 
				 back)
			   You draw lines with pencil!  I
			   know about this!

		The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
		looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
		bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
		instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
		back...

					CASH
			   What!?  Look at the ticket...!

					SAM WONG
			   Get out, I call 911.

		The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

					CASH
			   You're lookin' at me, you're
			   not even lookin' at the
			   ticket!

		The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
		the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

					SAM WONG
			   You leave now.  Take ticket
			   somewhere else.
				(calling out)
			   Next customer in line...!

					CASH
			   You first generation,
			   xenophobic, money-theistic,
			   hot pastrami sandwich
			   making...

					SAM WONG
				(screaming)
			   Get out!

		Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
		face...

					CASH
			   LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

		A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

					JACK
				(carefully)
			   Let me see that ticket.

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
				(menacing)
			   Was I talkin' to you?!

		Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
		then...

					JACK
			   Maybe I'll buy it from you.

		Now Cash walks over to Jack...

					CASH
			   Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
			   kicked tryin' to be a hero.
			   Film at eleven...
				(then...turning to 
				 the coffee machine)
			   What?!  Oh no, not another
			   lookie-loo.  You know how big
			   a job this is?

		The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
		confused.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You're double bookin' me!
			   You're gonna get double
			   billed!  Shit!

		Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
		SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
		baby...

					JACK
			   Hey, c'mon...

		In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
		pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
		covers her baby.

					CASH
				(in Jack's face)
			   Do you want to die?

		Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
		cool...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

					JACK
			   No.
 
					CASH
				(a smile)
			   Yes you do...

					JACK
			   Look, I'm talking about a
			   business deal here.  I buy the
			   ticket for two hundred, take
			   it to a store where the guy
			   behind the counter...
				(glaring at Sam Wong)
			   ...doesn't have a death wish
				(back to Cash)
			   ...I just made myself a quick
			   thirty eight dollars.

		Cash gets closer...

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Like I said, it's a business
			   deal...

					CASH
			   Damn, you are the real
			   thing...

		Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
		gun back into his pants...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
			   here...
				(to Sam Wong)
			   You were lookin' at me, papa,
			   you shoulda been lookin' at
			   the ticket.  That ticket was
			   legit, B.  You're fake...

		Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
		his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
		hundred dollars...

					JACK
			   How'd you know my name was
			   Jack?

					CASH
			   I call all you white guys
			   "Jack."

		Jack nods...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You know you seem pretty
			   relaxed for a guy who just had
			   a gun pulled on him.

					JACK
			   There's no way I was gonna die
			   in that deli...
				(off Cash's look)
			   Let's just say I've been on a
			   lucky streak lately.

					CASH
				(a big LAUGH)
			   A lucky streak, huh?

		Jack hands him the money.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Sound pretty sure of yourself,
			   don't you?

		Jack nods.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   So you're telling me, you've
			   got a gun to your head and you
			   don't think for one second,
			   what if this, what if that,
			   maybe I shouldn't do this, I
			   shoulda done that.

					JACK
			   I don't do that.  That's just
			   not for me...

		Cash looks at him, then smiles.

					CASH
			   Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
			   business with you...
			   Cash is about to take off...

					JACK
			   Hey...

		Cash turns around.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   What do you want to carry that
			   gun around for, anyway?
			   You're just gonna do something
			   you'll regret...

					CASH
			   You want to talk about
			   regrets, you're talking to the
			   wrong person.

		Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
		the carton...

					JACK
			   I'm just saying that you seem
			   like a smart guy.  At a
			   certain point you're gonna do
			   something, and then there's no
			   turning back...

					CASH
			   Yeah, in most cases that'd be
			   true.

		Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

					JACK
			   I mean there must be programs
			   out there, opportunities...

					CASH
				(a deep laugh)
			   Wait a minute, wait a
			   minute... you're tryin' to
			   save me?

		A look from Jack...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Oh man, you're serious...
				(out to the street)
			   This man thinks I need to be
			   saved!

					JACK
			   Everyone needs something.

		Cash looks at Jack...

					CASH
			   Yeah?  What do you need?

					JACK
			   Me?

					CASH
			   You just said everyone needs
			   something.

					JACK
			   I've got everything I need.

					CASH
			   Wow.  It must be great being
			   you.  You got it all.

		Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

					JACK
			   Look, I'm not saying you'd be
			   able to do it without some
			   hard work...

					CASH
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You still think this is about
			   me, don't you?

					JACK
			   Sure it's about you.  But it's
			   about society, too.

					CASH
			   Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
			   one... Just remember, Jack,
			   you did this.  You brought
			   this on yourself...

		And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
		street with his egg nog...

    22	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
		off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
		heads into the bedroom.

		Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

		CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    24	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he 
		opens his eyes...feels something strange...

		Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his 
		chest.

		A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
		remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

		He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

		...did she have a dog?

		He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

		...KATE REYNOLDS...

		...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

		His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived 
		in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
		the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window.

		He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
		on the night stand, but its not there.  Its a Timex 
		Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...

		Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its 
		a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

					KATE
			   Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
			   Jack... its Christmas...

		Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

		Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
		ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
		of her lungs...

					ANNIE
			   Jingle bells, Santa s
			   mells, Rudolph laid an 
			   egg...la la la, la-la la 
			   la, la la la la la...

		Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
		herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   You too, Luce...

		The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
		everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
		starts jumping.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   Rise...and...shine...!

					KATE
				(stirring)
			   Youre jumping, 
			   sweetheart...

		Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
		funeral.

					ANNIE
			   Mom, dont you think we 
			   need to open the 
			   presents?

					KATE
				(groggy)
			   Mommy needs five more 
			   minutes in la la land.  
			   That could be her 
			   present...

		Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing 
		on.

					ANNIE
			   Cmon, Dad.  Get up!

		She said Dad.

		Thats it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
		gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it.

		He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

		Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
		for the first time...hes naked...

		...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
		the bed...

		...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
		cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

		Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

					KATE
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
		near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
		eyes...

		Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her 
		scream...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(still groggy)
			   Strong coffee, okay?

		She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

		A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
		of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
		gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
		fireplace.

		Jack darts to the top of the steps...

					KATE (O.S.)
				(calling from 
				 the bedroom)
			   Use an entire can if you 
			   have to!

		He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
		stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
		in shock.

		He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
		door...about to step out when he looks down and 
		realizes...

		...hes barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
		boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
		leave when...

		He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
		lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
		do...

		The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
		wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
		60s), Kates parents.  Big Eds wearing a ten gallon 
		hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
		dangling from her mouth.

					JACK
				(drawing on a 
				 memory)
			   Ed?  Lorraine?

		Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
		gifts.

					BIG ED
			   Jack you ol bird dog.  
			   Merry Christmas to ya...

		Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.

					LORRAINE
			   Talk to him, Jack.  
			   Please.  One day a year 
			   away from the Ponderosa.  
			   I dont think thats too 
			   much to ask.

					BIG ED
			   I heard that.  This is 
			   who I am, woman!
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Tell her, Jack!  Youre 
			   the only one who gets me, 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

					LORRAINE
			   I need some egg nog...

					BIG ED
			   Course you do.  Hell, 
			   its almost 8 a.m.  
				(shouting upstairs)
			   Where are my two lil 
			   pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
			   Giddy up, Bid Eds here!

					JACK
			   Excuse me.

		Jack dashes out the door.

					LORRAINE
			   Where are you going, 
			   Jack?
				(to Big Ed)
			   Wheres he going?

					BIG ED
			   Damned if I know...

		They start to remove their coats, when...

		The door flies back open...

					JACK
			   Wheres my car?!  Wheres 
			   my Ferrari!?

					BIG ED
			   What the hell are you 
			   talking about?
				(to Lorraine)
			   Whats he talking about?

					JACK
			   Look, can I just borrow 
			   your car?!  I promise 
			   itll be returned!

					BIG ED
			   The Caddy?  Why dont you 
			   take your own damn car!

					LORRAINE
			   Oh just let him borrow 
			   your precious Cadillac, 
			   for gods sake.

		Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

					BIG ED
			   Hes got a perfectly good 
			   mini-van sitting out 
			   there in the driveway!

		Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
		house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
		in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

		He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
		driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the 
		rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
		of the driveway...

    27	INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...

    28	INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

		Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
		passes under a sign for Manhattan.

    29	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

		The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.  
		Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
		running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
		sternly in front.

					JACK
			   Tony, thank god...

		Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
			   for residents and guests 
			   only...

					JACK
			   What are you talking 
			   about?  Its me, Jack 
			   Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
			   I put you into commercial 
			   paper!

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(not moving)
			   Uh-huh...

		Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
		her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

					JACK
			   Elizabeth Peterson!

		The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(to Tony re: 
				 Jack, annoyed)
			   Who is this man?

		Tony shrugs his shoulders.

					JACK
			   You know me, Betty.  You 
			   do.  Jack Campbell.  
			   Were on the co-op board 
			   together.  We fought side 
			   by side for garbage 
			   disposals.  Every morning 
			   we exchange quasi-sexual 
			   witty banter.  Think...

		She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
		YAPPING.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(to Mrs. Peterson)
			   Should I call the cops?  
			   Im gonna call the 
			   cops...

		Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(raising a hand 
				 to Tony)
			   No...

					JACK
				(a sigh of relief)
			   Thank you, Betty.  I know 
			   if I can just sleep this 
			   off, Ill be fine...

					MRS. PETERSON			
			   And sleep you shall.  
			   Noblesse oblige is not 
			   dead.  Not yet 
			   anyway...Come, lets get 
			   you some help.  Surely 
			   there must be a shelter 
			   somewhere in this city.

					JACK
			   A shelter?!  Im the 
			   richest guy in the 
			   building...Ive got twice 
			   the square footage you 
			   have!

		Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
		her face.

		Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

		CUT TO:

    30	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

		Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
		van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
		building entrance...

    31	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

		Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
		desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

		Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

					FRANK
			   Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
			   it right there...

					JACK
			   Frank.  Wheres Alan 
			   Mintz?  Is he here yet?

					FRANK
			   Mr. Mintz?
				(a knowing chuckle)
			   I dont think 
			   so...buildings closed 
			   pal.  Youll have to come 
			   back tomorrow.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont know whats 
			   going on here but I am 
			   Senior Vice President of 
			   this company.

					FRANK
			   I dont care who you 
			   are.  Its Christmas and 
			   like I told you the 
			   building is closed.

					JACK
			   Maybe youre not hearing 
			   me.  I am Jack 
			   Campbell...
				(approaching the 
				 building directory)
			   Right here.  Jack 
			   Campbell, President...

		And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed 
		plain as day on the building director...

		Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
		directory...

		A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
		shock...

		CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?

    32	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

		...its desolate...

		Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
		registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
		toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

		SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks 
		torso...a VOICE from the car...

					VOICE (O.S.)
			   Hey!  Watch where youre 
			   walking!

		Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant 
		quite make out the face...

					VOICE 
			   You almost dented my two 
			   hundred thousand dollar 
			   car!

		Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
		familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   Thats right!  My new 
			   cars worth more than 
			   your shitty house!

		A look of realization on Jacks face...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   I feel like I really did 
			   win the lottery!

		...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...

		Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
		smile from Cash...

					CASH
			   Miss me, Jack?

					JACK
			   Thats my car!  You stole 
			   my car!

					CASH
			   Its a callable asset 
			   seized in accordance with 
			   the acquisition by-laws 
			   of your alt-fate 
			   contract...

					JACK
			   What?!

					CASH
			   Basically, its my car 
			   now.  Get in.

		Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
		hesitates...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont make the 
			   rules, Jack.  This is how 
			   it works.  Get in.

		Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33	INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

		Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
		burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
		back seat...

					CASH
			   Might wanna fasten your 
			   seat belt, Jack...

					JACK
				(recovering)
			   What the hell is 
			   happening to me?!

		Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
		of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
		breathing into the bag.

					CASH
			   This kinda thing makes a 
			   lotta guys throw up.  
			   Seen it happen.  So if 
			   you get the urge, do it 
			   out the window.
				(with a taunting 
				 laugh)
			   I dont want you marring 
			   this exquisite leather 
			   interior...

		Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it, 
		sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
		smiles...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont know what 
			   youre getting so worked 
			   up about, you did 
			   this...you brought this 
			   on yourself.

					JACK
			   Brought what on myself?!  
			   I didnt do anything!

					CASH
			   No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive 
			   got everything I need, I 
			   dont have regrets, 
			   thats just not for me... 
			   sound familiar?

					JACK
			   You mean because you 
			   thought I was cocky Im 
			   now on a permanent acid 
			   trip?!!

		Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...

					CASH
			   Everyone else in that 
			   store is a statue, they 
			   see their lives passing 
			   in front of their eyes, 
			   but not you.  Youre 
			   making a business deal...

					JACK
				(enraged)
			   Give me my goddamn life 
			   back!

					CASH
			   You?  What about me?  Im 
			   working hard for you 
			   here, Jack.  On Christmas 
			   too!  Now you did a good 
			   thing last night, 
			   intervening that way.  I 
			   was moved...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			   Please.  Just tell me 
			   whats happening to me.  
			   In plain English.  None 
			   of that mumbo jumbo...

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
			   Its a glimpse, Jacko.

					JACK
			   I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
			   what!?  What glimpse?!  
			   Glimpse!

					CASH
			   Look, eventually, 
			   everybody gets one...some 
			   of em take a couple 
			   seconds...
				(looking at Jack)
			   ...some of em take a lot 
			   longer...

					JACK
			   I asked you a direct 
			   question!  A glimpse of 
			   what?!

		A look from Cash.

					CASH
			   Figure it out.  You got 
			   plenty of time.

					JACK
			   How much time?!

					CASH
			   As long as it takes to 
			   figure it out.  Which, in 
			   your case, could be 
			   considerable.

					JACK
			   Look, I just want my life 
			   back.  Now whats it 
			   gonna take?  You wanna 
			   talk turkey?  Lets talk 
			   turkey!  How much 
			   money...?

		Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
		Jack a smile.

					CASH
			   Do I look like I need 
			   your money.  It doesnt 
			   work like that and I 
			   cant tell you why.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					CASH
			   Because you got to figure 
			   it out for yourself.
				(beat)
			   Are you listening to me?

					JACK
			   Figure it out?  Figure 
			   what out?!

		Cash just stares at him...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats it?  Thats all I 
			   get?!  A glare?!

					CASH
			   Look Jack, in my 
			   experience the best way 
			   people deal with this is 
			   to just relax and breathe 
			   through it...let it come 
			   to you.

		Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont have time 
			   for this right now.  Im 
			   in the middle of a 
			   deal...
					CASH
			   Oh youre working on a 
			   new deal now...did I
			   mention that?

					JACK
			   You know what?  Ive had 
			   it with you.  Ive had it 
			   with all of this shit...

		SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
		sending Jack through the windshield.

		Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
		to the mini-van.

		Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
		Jack...

					CASH
			   Here...

		Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
		BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

					JACK
			   Whats this, a signal?  
			   Will you come whenever I 
			   ring it?

					CASH
			   Do I look like I live in 
			   a bottle?

		Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

					JACK
				(lost)
			   But what do I do?

					CASH
			   Look Jack Im late.  Id 
			   love to help you out some 
			   more but I gotta go 
			   handle my business...
				(gesturing to 
				 the mini-van)
			   Happy trails.

		Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
		to Cash.

					JACK
			   Hey, you did this to me, 
			   you cant just leave me 
			   like this.

		Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

					CASH
			   Fine.  You want to know 
			   everything, Ill tell you 
			   everything.  But not 
			   here.  Lets get some 
			   air...

		Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
		driver side door...

					JACK
				(relieved)
			   Thanks, man...

		Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
		around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
		a blast of horsepower...

		Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
		the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
		disappearing...

		The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
		Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
		and finally to the mini-van.

    34	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

		The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
		the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
		Christmas.

    35	INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

		Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
		steering wheel and the cars registration in his 
		hand...

		He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
		science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
		late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
		fruit in hand...

		Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
		window.

					JACK
			   Excuse me.  Do you know 
			   where Merrison Street is?

		Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

					ARNIE
				(turning to his wife)
			   Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36	INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
		decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his 
		shoulder.

					ARNIE
			   You look terrible...

		Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time 
		fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
		board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Truth is I expected you.  
			   Kate called before and 
			   asked if I knew where you 
			   were.

		Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I know, I moved the 
			   Barca-lounger into the 
			   corner.  Its throwin 
			   everybody off.  What do 
			   you think?

					JACK
				(with a nod)
			   Great room...

		A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means 
		something to him.

					ARNIE
			   You and me, buddy.  We 
			   know how to live...

		Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
		out of a bamboo bottle holder.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   So Jack, you okay?

		Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
		photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
		with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
		Champs, 1994.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I mean you leave the 
			   house on Christmas 
			   morning, you dont tell 
			   anyone where youre 
			   going...

		Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

					JACK
			   Were friends, arent we?

					ARNIE
			   Maybe I dont say it 
			   enough but you moving in 
			   next door to me...

		Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
		nods.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Talk to me...

		A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
		open eyed, ready to listen.

					JACK
			   Im having kind of a bad 
			   day.

					ARNIE
				(nodding)
			   I read somewhere that the 
			   suicide rate doubles 
			   during the holidays...

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(to himself)
			   What am I saying?  You 
			   dont need to hear 
			   that...
				(back to Jack)
			   All I meant was a lot of 
			   people have a hard time 
			   dealing with all the 
			   forced reverie, thats 
			   all.  Is that you?

					JACK
			   Is it...?

					ARNIE
			   Trouble at work?

					JACK
			   I dont think so.

					ARNIE
			   Its not Kate, is it?

		Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnies eyes 
		widen...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(proudly)
			   You see, its like were 
			   in each others heads...

					JACK
			   Kates my wife...

		Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.

					ARNIE
				(a playful smile) 
			   Just keep saying it, 
			   Jack, like a mantra.

		Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
		arm.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Cmon, I better walk ya 
			   home.  Shes mad enough 
			   as it is, right...?

    37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

		Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

					ARNIE
			   Look, you fit the profile 
			   exactly.  Thirties, 
			   house, kids, financial 
			   responsibilities.  You 
			   start thinking...this 
			   isnt the life I dreamt 
			   about.  Wheres the 
			   romance, wheres the joie 
			   de vivre?  Suddenly, 
			   every lingerie ad in the 
			   Newark Star Ledger 
			   represents a life you 
			   cant have...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			   Its just two kids, 
			   right?

		A chuckle from Arnie.

					ARNIE
			   You made a choice, Jack, 
			   a promise to your wife. 
			   Maybe sometimes it seems 
			   like you gave up the 
			   world, but look what you 
			   got...

		They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
		cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
		lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
		built...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Four bedrooms, two and a 
			   half baths, and a 
			   partially finished 
			   basement...

		Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(shaking his head)
			   Kids...

		Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Okay look, you probably 
			   dont want to hear this 
			   right now but remember
			   what you told me last 
			   summer when I almost had 
			   that thing with Arnie 
			   Jr.s speech therapist.

		A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
		glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
		shoulders and looking him in the eye.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Dont screw up the best 
			   thing in your life just 
			   because youre a little 
			   unsure about who you 
			   are.  Okay?

		Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   God, it feels so good to 
			   finally give something 
			   back to you...

		Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Im gonna hug you now...

		Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
		push toward the door...

    38	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

		Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
		Arnies gone.

		Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Hold on a second...

		She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, shes 
		dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

					JACK
			   You cut your hair...

		A curious look from Kate.

					KATE
			   Ten years ago...

		Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
		nothing.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Are you okay?

					JACK
			   Yeah...fine.

		She gives him a resolute nod, then...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Never mind, he just 
			   walked in...

		Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
		stares him down angrily.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Do you have any idea what 
			   you put us through 
			   today?!  You walk out of 
			   here at 7:30 in the 
			   morning, dont tell me 
			   where youre going, or 
			   even that youre going, 
			   and I dont see you til 
			   hours later.  I had state 
			   troopers looking for 
			   you!  I called 
			   hospitals...
				(pointing at 
				 the phone)
			   ...I was just on the 
			   phone with the morgue 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
		building.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man leaves 
			   his family on Christmas 
			   morning without a word 
			   about where hes going?

		Jacks almost to a breaking po	INT.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man does 
			   that!?

					JACK
				(jumping in)
			   I dont know!  Please 
			   stop yelling at me!

		She looks at him curiously.

					KATE
			   Where were you?

					JACK
			   I was in the city.

					KATE
			   The city?  New York 
			   City?  Why?

					JACK
			   Because thats where I 
			   live.

					KATE
			   Jack...dont even 
			   start...

					JACK
			   Look, you dont 
			   understand.  I woke up 
			   here...and this is very 
			   strange ...this is not my 
			   house...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
		room...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(pointing upstairs)
			   Im not Dad....  Kate, 
			   youre not my wife...

		Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

					KATE
			   You know what, Jack?  
			   Its not funny this 
			   time.  Im really angry.

		She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
		no answer.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(loudly)
			   Jack!

		Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
		gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
		RINGING it furiously.

		Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

					ANNIE
				(re: bell)
			   Whats that?

		Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
		and takes the bicycle bell...

					ANNIE (CONTD)
				(examining the bell)
			   I like this...
				(jumping up and 
				 giving hima peck 
				 on the cheek)
			   ...thanks, Dad!

		Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

		Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

					KATE
			   You missed the whole 
			   thing, Jack.  The 
			   pancakes, the 
			   presents...you spent six 
			   hours putting that bike 
			   together and you didnt 
			   even get to see the look 
			   on Annies face when she 
			   opened it...

		Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You missed Christmas, 
			   Jack.

		Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
		to the moment...

					JACK
			   Im...Im sorry.

		Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

					KATE
			   Look, we dont have time 
			   for this right now, well 
			   talk about it later.  Now 
			   get dressed...
				(pointing to his 
				 outfit)
			   Youre not wearing that 
			   to the Thompsons party.  
			   I dont care how 
			   hilarious you think it 
			   is...

					JACK
			   Party?  Oh no, I cant go 
			   to a party...

					KATE
			   You look forward to this 
			   party all year.  Whats 
			   with you today?

					JACK
			   Trust me on this Kate.  I 
			   really dont think going 
			   to a party is the right 
			   move for me at the 
			   present time.

		Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

					KATE
			   Fine.  Do whatever you 
			   want.

		She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

					JACK
			   What are you doing?

					KATE
			   Telling my mother she 
			   doesnt have to stay with 
			   the kids.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					KATE
			   Because youll be here.

		Kate just looks at him.

					JACK
			   Ill be ready in ten 
			   minutes.

		He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
		watching him...

		He opens the door...its a closet.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Christ...
				(turning around)
			   Where the hell is the 
			   bathroom?

					KATE
			   Funny, Jack.  Im 
			   laughing on the inside.

    39	INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

		The light comes on...

		Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
		collect himself...but somethings not right...

		He glances around...the bathroom is small and its 
		cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...

		...none of this stuff is his...

		...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
		forlorn sense of displacement...

		...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
		anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

		After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
		face...

    40	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
		slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
		shoes...

		He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
		sport coats.

					JACK
			   This is just...
				(searching for 
				 the words)
			   ...this is sub-par...

		Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
		closet.

		He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
		exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

		Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
		pair of the slacks...

    41	EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
		the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
		decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
		decorations this side of Pasaic.

		Kate RINGS the doorbell...

		EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too 
		tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

					EVELYN
			   Kate!  Jack!
				(turning around, 
				 to guests)
			   Everybody, Jack and Kate 
			   are here!

		Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
		GUESTS.

		A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
		condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks 
		arm...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Like the dress...?

					JACK
				(glancing at it)
				 Its lovely...

					EVELYN
				(a satisfied smile)
			   I thought I saw you 
			   notice it at the kids 
			   recital.

		Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
		to catch up with Kate...

    42	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

		The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
		b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

		Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater 
		than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The 
		Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
		new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
		imported from Europe, but everyones having a good 
		time...

		...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
		THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
		walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...

					NICK
			   Did you see Van Horn last 
			   night?  This kids gonna 
			   single-handedly save 
			   basketball in the state 
			   of New Jersey...

					JACK
			   The Nets?  Youre kidding, 
			   right...?

		Nick looks at him in disbelief.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			   Well...theyre certainly 
			   due.

		BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
		plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.

					BILL KRAMER
			   So tomorrows the big 
			   day, Jackie...

					JACK
			   Okay...why?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Triple bypass.  Im going 
			   under the knife.  I told 
			   you, didnt I?

					JACK
			   Triple bypass?
				(pointing to his 
				 plate)
			   You really think you 
			   should be eating all 
			   that?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Why not?  I figure Im 
			   going in for a cleaning 
			   tomorrow, I might as well 
			   load up on the fried 
			   stuff tonight...

					ARNIE
			   Good thinking, Bill.  
			   Have another drink.
				(whispering to Jack)
			   Hell be lucky if he 
			   lives through the 
			   night...

		Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
		Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
		politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

		Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
		first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
		puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an 
		effort...

		Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
		hand...

					EVELYN
				(holding out a 
				 puff to Jack)
			   Finger food...?

					JACK
			   I dont think so, thank 
			   you...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Cmon, as soon as I put 
			   them down, youre gonna 
			   grab a couple...you 
			   always do...

		Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
		other side of the room...Kate watches as...

		Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly 
		putting it near his lips...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Let me.  Theyll melt in 
			   your mouth...

		He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
		treat inside...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Good?

		On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial 
		expression, this would be it...

					JACK
				(forcing a smile) 
			   Theyre great!  Thank 
			   you!

		...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
		Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

					EVELYN
			   Mushroom puffs arent the 
			   only thing I do well...

					JACK
			   Well do whatever it is 
			   you do well, and 
			   just...just do it.  
			   Excuse me...

		Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

		Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
		stairs...

    43	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

		Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
		guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
		telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

					JACK
				(loudly, into phone)
			   ...what do you mean he 
			   wont come to the phone?!
				(standing, indignant)
			   Do you realize how much 
			   money Ive made for that 
			   sonuvabitch in the last 
			   eight years?!

		Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Damnit!

		He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

					KATE (O.S.)
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
		him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
		her face.

					KATE
			   Are you sure youre 
			   okay...?

		A forced smile from Jack.

					JACK
			   Yes, Im fine.  Its just 
			   this god awful football 
			   phone!  Who has a phone 
			   like this anyway?!

					KATE
				(doubtful)  
			   Uh huh...

		Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You must really love 
			   Evelyns mushroom puffs, 
			   huh?
				(with a wink)
			   You know theyre not 
			   real...

		She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
		He looks across the room and sees...

		Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
		jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

		Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
		slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

		He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

					KATE
				(to guests)
			   ...then she asks me to 
			   put this sweater on.  
			   What choice do I have, 
			   right?

		Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   But as Im slipping it on 
			   I notice shes misspelled 
			   the word lawyers.
				(laughing)
			   I had to go through the 
			   entire day wearing a hand 
			   embroidered sweater that 
			   said, Non-Profit Layers 
			   Do It For Free.

		The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
		laughing, until...

					JACK
				(to Kate, off-hand)
			   So youre a lawyer...?

		A chuckle from the group.  Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   A non-profit lawyer...

		People are starting to LAUGH.

					KATE
				(a little embarrassed)
			   Jack...

					JACK
			   Pro bono.  You dont get 
			   paid at all.  Nobody 
			   makes a dime.  Well, 
			   bravo...

		Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

		CUT TO:

    45	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

		Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
		them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
		face.

					KATE
			   I better go wake my
			   mother...

		Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Here you go...

					JACK
			   Youre kidding me...

					KATE
			   Shes your dog, Jack.

					JACK
			   No, shes not.

					KATE
			   Fine, shes the kids 
			   dog.  Lets go wake Josh, 
			   see if he wants to walk 
			   her.

					JACK
			   But its twenty degrees 
			   outside...

					KATE
				(sympathetic)
			   Youre having a bad day, 
			   Ill go with 
			   you...actually, theres 
			   no way in hell youre 
			   gettin me back out 
			   there...

		Jack looks at the dogs face.  Lucy couldnt be more 
		excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
		leash.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(heading up the 
				 stairs)
			   Make sure you reward her 
			   verbally when she does a 
			   number two...

		CUT TO:

    46	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		The sound of CRICKETS.

		Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
		street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
		winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
		of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.

					JACK
			   Figure it out...Im s
			   crewed...dont have to 
			   be a genius to figure 
			   that out...

		The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Lucy)
			   Its as good a place as 
			   any...

		But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   ...but obviously not up 
			   to your high standards...
				(to himself)
			   Okay...he said youre 
			   working on a new deal 
			   now...fine, youve done a 
			   thousand deals, whats 
			   the first thing you do?

		Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but 
		Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Triage.  Its your 
			   signature.  You survey 
			   the damage, find out 
			   everything you can, you 
			   probe, leave nothing to 
			   chance.  Im just gonna 
			   have to go detective.  
			   How did you get 
			   Mentadent?  You learned 
			   everything there was to 
			   know about toothpaste and 
			   then you pounced...

		Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats our play here...

		Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   If you could take a dump 
			   some time in this 
			   century, then we could go 
			   home where its warm...

		Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   That is if I can even 
			   remember how to get 
			   home...
				(to Lucy)
			   You remember, dont you 
			   girl?

		But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

		Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
		cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

		He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
		on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
		pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
		resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

		CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
	
    48	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

		Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
		7:14.

		Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them 
		from the window...like the morning light in his 
		Manhattan loft...

		He reaches across the bed...its empty...

		A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
		the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

		The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
		pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in 
		Jersey.

		Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
		hoping itll stop...it doesnt.  Then, he hears the 
		sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

		He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

		The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast 
		of Burden.  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
		the song...

					JACK
			   Hello?

		No answer...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(louder, over music)
			   Hello!

					KATE
				(singing)
			   ...my feet are hurtin...

					JACK
				(yelling)
			   HEY!

		Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
		shower curtain open...

		Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats 
		something hes missed...then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Uh...that babys crying...

					KATE
				(unimpressed)
			   And...?

		...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
		naked body.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont give me that look, 
			   Jack, Tuesdays your day 
			   and you know it.  And try 
			   to get Josh to day care 
			   on time, okay?  He missed 
			   the macaroni painting 
			   last week...

		She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

		CUT TO:

    50	INT. JOSHS ROOM - MORNING

		Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
		as...

		Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
		Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
		plastic keys.

		Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
		the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
		rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
		grabs at Jacks nose.

		He looks over to Annie.  Shes still staring at him 
		like hes a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
		the box of Huggies.

					JACK
			   Pull tape...

		Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
		gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
		the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Holy mother of god!

		Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
		a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
		the dresser.

		Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
		lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You must be kidding...

		Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

					ANNIE
			   Youre not really our 
			   dad, are you?

		Jack turns to her.  Shes looking back at him with 
		complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
		moment.  Then...

					JACK
			   No, Im not.

		A look of curiosity from Annie.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I work on Wall Street, 
			   you know with the big 
			   buildings...?

		No response from Annie...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I live in an apartment 
			   house with a doorman, I 
			   can buy just about 
			   anything I want...

		Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   This isnt my real life.  
			   Its just a glimpse...

					ANNIE
			   Wheres my real dad?

					JACK
			   I dont know...

		A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that 
		shes about to cry.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   But dont worry, he loves 
			   you and Im sure hell be 
			   back very soon...
				(to himself)
			   ...very, very soon...

		Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
		and tugging firmly at his hair.

					ANNIE
			   They did a pretty good 
			   job.

					JACK
			   Who did?

					ANNIE
			   The aliens...In the 
			   mother ship.  You look 
			   just like him.

					JACK
			   Uhh...thanks...slightly 
			   better looking though, 
			   right?

		Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Youre not going to start 
			   crying, are you?  Because 
			   Im not really sure I 
			   could deal with that 
			   right now.

		She thinks about it for a moment.

					ANNIE
			   Do you like kids?

					JACK
			   On a case by case 
			   basis...

					ANNIE
			   You know how to make 
			   chocolate milk?

					JACK
			   I think I could figure it 
			   out.

					ANNIE
			   You promise not to kidnap 
			   me and my brother and 
			   implant stuff in our brains?

					JACK
			   Sure.

		Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

					ANNIE
			   Welcome to earth.

    51	INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

		Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

		Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
		monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre 
		clearly supposed to be in the back.

					ANNIE
			   Stop here...

		Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
		Center.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   This is day care.  Its 
			   where babies go when 
			   their parents are at 
			   work.

					JACK
			   Check...

		He gets out of the van...

    52	EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

		...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
		building, holding the baby away from his body.

		He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
		LADY.  She stares at Joshs outfit...

					JACK
			   Do I get a receipt or 
			   something...?

		The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.

    53	EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

		The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
		suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

					ANNIE
			   I have winter camp until 
			   four, then ballet until 
			   five thirty.

					JACK
			   Five thirty.  Okay.

					ANNIE
			   Try not to be late 
			   because kids dont like 
			   to be the last one picked 
			   up.

					JACK
			   Got it.  Good tip.

					ANNIE
			   Bye...

		CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

		Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(calling out window)
			   Hey!  Annie!

		Annie turns back toward him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Where do I go now?

					ANNIE
			   Big Eds.

					JACK
			   Big Eds?  Big Eds 
			   Tires?
				(suspicious)
			   Why...?

					ANNIE
			   Thats where you work.

		A beat.  Then...

					JACK
			   You mean I sell tires...

		She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats what I do.  Im a 
			   tire salesman...

		CUT TO:

    54	INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he 
		spots something a hundred yards down the road...

					JACK
			   Good Lord...

		...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
		Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

		Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly, 
		taking it all in...

		Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
		store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
		everything from alignments to brake jobs...

		Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
		Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
		with TOMMY the salesman.

					TOMMY
			   Hey Jack, you happen to 
			   know the stock number on 
			   those new Michelin X1's?

					JACK
			   Uh...lemme get back to 
			   you on that one...
				(looking at his 
				 name tag)
			   Tommy...

					HECTOR
				(to Tommy)
			   Thomas, why you bother 
			   Jack about that.  Look it 
			   up yourself...
				(to Jack)
			   Okay Jack, we talk 
			   later...

		Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
		with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

		Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
		behind the counter...

					BIG ED
			   Jack my boy!  You are 
			   looking mighty worse for 
			   the wear...Hey, guess who
			   I played bridge with two 
			   nights ago...?

		Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

					BIG ED (CONTD) 
			   Hell, youll never 
			   guess.  One Sydney 
			   Potter.  Thats Sydney 
			   Potter, Chief Executive 
			   Officer of BuyRite 
			   Transport.  Only the 
			   third largest trucking 
			   company in the state.  I 
			   even let the sonuvabitch 
			   win, which wasnt easy 
			   because the guys been 
			   bashed in the head by 
			   Teamsters so many times 
			   his brains like 
			   porridge.  Anyhoo, hes 
			   looking for a new parts 
			   supplier... we can handle 
			   that kind of volume, 
			   right?

		Jack considers this briefly.

					JACK
			   Im gonna have to get 
			   back to you on that...Ed.

		Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
		at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
		as...

		Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
		by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Do I have a private 
			   office somewhere in the 
			   building?

					KENNY
			   Uh...sure Jack...
				(nervously pointing)
			   Right back there...

					JACK
			   Thank you.

		Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57	INT. JACKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
		bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
		littered with tire inventory and price lists...

		Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

		He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
		the room and sits down behind it...

		On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
		plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
		and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
		Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...

		He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
		drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
		inside...

		He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
		back...

		Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine 
		and gives it a good look...

					JACK
			   Bowlers do it in an 
			   alley?...Non profit 
			   lawyers do it for free... 
			   what is it with these 
			   people?  Dont they 
			   realize this refers to 
			   sex?

		He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
		where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
		out...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   At least you splurged on 
			   some decent scotch...

		He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
		drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
		cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball 
		hoop/garbage can near the door.

		He misses...

		He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
		family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
		the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them, 
		Jack is smiling...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in 
				 the photo)
			   What are you smiling 
			   about...?

		He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
		behind him.  It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
		Junior Sales Associate, 1988.  Jack raises an 
		eyebrow...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Number one...not bad.

		He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
		carefully...

					JACK (CONTD)

			   1988...?  I was in London 
			   in 1988...

		Jacks jarred into reality...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in the photo)
			   You never went to London...
				(picking up the photo)
			   ...you never got on that 
			   plane...

		He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

		The P.A. system comes to life...

					ESTELLE
				(over P.A.)
			   Jack to mag 
			   wheels...Jack, youre 
			   needed in mag wheels, 
			   customer waiting!

		CUT TO:

    58	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

		Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.

					JACK
			   ...I was the number one 
			   junior sales associate at 
			   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
			   you know that?

					KENNY
			   No, I didnt...thats 
			   great.

					JACK
			   Thats the kind of thing 
			   you can really build 
			   on...

					KENNY
			   Uh huh...

					JACK
			   I mean sales has always 
			   been a feeder for M and 
			   A, always...

		They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales 
		associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
		displays...

					KENNY
			   Here we are, mag wheels...
				(a little concerned)
			   Hey Jack, are you sure 
			   youre okay?

					JACK
			   Well, Im just a little 
			   confused right now about 
			   why I work here...

		Kenny looks at him nervously.

					KENNY
			   Uh...I just started here 
			   last Tuesday.

		Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
		Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
		the customer.

					TOMMY
				(to the customer)
			   So youre all set on the 
			   Skip Shift eliminator and 
			   the Brembo rotors.  
			   Jacks our point man on 
			   alloy wheels...

					JACK
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Do you know why do I work 
			   here...?

					TOMMY
			   Because youre the best 
			   damn tire guy in the 
			   state of New Jersey...
				(proudly, to the 
				 customer)
			   Jack taught me everything 
			   I know about the 
			   business...

		The customer nods, impressed.

					JACK
			   I taught you the business?

		Another nod to the customer.

					TOMMY
			   And hes a crack-up.

					JACK
			   Everything I taught you.  
			   I want to hear it all, 
			   right now.

		Tommys confused.

					CUSTOMER
			   Hey, Im ready to buy 
			   here...

					JACK
				(to the customer)
			   What do you want?

					CUSTOMER
			   I want some alloy wheels.

		Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
		it out to the customer.

					JACK
			   Here.  These are great.  
			   Youll need four.

		The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
		confused...

					CUSTOMER
			   But I dont like these...

					JACK
			   Hey, you heard the guy, 
			   Im the best damn tire 
			   guy in the state of New 
			   Jersey.
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Everything.

					TOMMY
			   Okay...
				(hesitating)
			   Rule number one, the 
			   customer is always 
			   right...

		A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, JACKS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

		Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
		phone...

					JACK
				(into phone)
			   ...I have no idea what 
			   our inventory level is, 
			   thats why Im asking 
			   you...

		A KNOCK at the door...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Look, just send us what 
			   you sent us last month, 
			   okay...?  And keep doing 
			   that until further 
			   notice...

		He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
		his head in...

					BIG ED
			   Got a minute, Jack?

					JACK
			   Ive got all the time in 
			   the world...

		Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
		tough looking man...

					BIG ED
			   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
			   BuyRite Transport, one of 
			   Jerseys top 
			   businessmen...

		Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
		trying to place the name.  Then...

					JACK
			   ...and a helluva bridge 
			   player.  Eds told me a 
			   lot about you...

		They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
		immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

					POTTER
				(in a heavy Jersey 
				 accent)
			   Lucky in cards, lucky in 
			   business, lucky in love.  
			   My cup runneth over...
				(to Big Ed)
			   Hes a nice looking 
			   boy...

					BIG ED
			   My daughters no slouch 
			   either...

		A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

					POTTER
			   Lets cut to the chase, 
			   Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
			   youre the grease that 
			   makes the wheels turn 
			   around here.  I need a 
			   new parts supplier for my 
			   fleet.  You seem to have 
			   the parts.  That we 
			   know.  What we dont know 
			   is why the hell I should 
			   buy them from you.

		Potter stares Jack down.  But Jacks not about to be 
		intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potters 
		stare.  Then...

					JACK
			   I have no idea...

		A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
		Big Ed.

					BIG ED
				(nervous)
			   Cmon Jack...

					JACK
				(to Potter)
			   I mean it.  From what I 
			   can tell, were a mom and 
			   pop operation, were 
			   already over-extended in 
			   sales, and any price 
			   advantage we could offer 
			   would easily be matched 
			   by a larger supplier...

		Jack continues to stare down Potter.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   So like I said, I dont 
			   have any idea why you 
			   should buy your parts 
			   from us...

		The staring match continues.  Big Eds getting more 
		nervous.  Potters the first to blink.

					POTTER
			   Okay, you got my 
			   attention...

					JACK
			   Except for rule number 
			   one...

		Jack smiles.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The customer is always 
			   right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
			   The difference is, we 
			   mean it.  Were small, we 
			   need our customers.  We 
			   cant afford to 
			   disappoint them, ever. 
			   Yeah, you could go to 
			   some leviathan supplier, 
			   probably save a few 
			   pennies on the price of 
			   oil filters, but with us 
			   you get more than a 
			   supplier, you get a 
			   bridge partner...

		A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
		watches, thrilled...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You want to bid hearts, 
			   were right there with 
			   you.  You feel the need 
			   to redouble, youre not 
			   going to get any argument 
			   from us...

		Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The big guys may have the 
			   high cards, but you know 
			   as well as I do, Sydney, 
			   high cards dont always 
			   take the trick.

		Potter pauses a minute, then...

					POTTER
				(to Big Ed, 
				 re: Jack)
			   I like him...

		Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

					BIG ED
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Thats my boy...
				(an arm around Potter)
			   Cmon, lemme show you the 
			   rest of the ranch...

		Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

					BIG ED (CONTD)
				(turning back to Jack)
			   Nice shootin, Jack...

		...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
		face.

    60	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

		Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
		REPORTER at the anchors desk...

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...advancers led 
			   decliners by a nine to 
			   four ratio and the 
			   closing tick was a mildly 
			   bullish plus seventy 
			   six.  Much of the 
			   markets action today was 
			   fueled by the latest 
			   round of merger mania to 
			   hit Wall Street...

		The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
		graphic in the corner of the screen...

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   ...when Global Health 
			   Systems and MedTech 
			   Pharmaceutical announced 
			   their intentions to join 
			   forces in a massive one 
			   hundred and twenty two 
			   billion dollar stock swap 
			   deal.  Though neither 
			   side expressed 
			   significant regulatory 
			   concerns at the 
			   announcement press 
			   conference, it is 
			   believed that both the 
			   FDA and the FTC will be 
			   closely scrutinizing the 
			   marriage, the largest 
			   ever in the health care 
			   industry.  When asked 
			   about possible anti-
			   competitive implications, 
			   Global Chairman Bob 
			   Thomas referred reporters 
			   to P.K. Lassiter and 
			   Company President Alan 
			   Mintz, the original 
			   architect behind the 
			   deal...

		Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
		confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the 
		press conference.

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   Ironically, Mintz first 
			   met Thomas at a Lamaze 
			   class...

					JACK
			   A Lamaze class...!?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...while coaching their 
			   pregnant wives, Mintz and T
			   homas struck up a 
			   dialogue about the need 
			   for consolidation in the 
			   rapidly growing health 
			   care industry and two 
			   months later, the deal 
			   with MedTech was born...

					JACK
			   What?!  Thats my deal?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   In other business news, 
			   U.S. Labor Department 
			   officials announced today
			   that two hundred and 
			   seventy-five thousand new
			   jobs were created last 
			   month, twenty-five 
			   thousand less than 
			   economists were 
			   predicting, leading to a 
			   mild rally in the bond 
			   markets before midday.  
			   But as the trading 
			   session drew to a close, 
			   the profit takers stepped 
			   in and the long bond 
			   closed at ninety seven 
			   even, up only two ticks, 
			   the yield inching down to 
			   six point zero seven 
			   percent...

		Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
		Jacks NYU sweatshirt...

					KATE
			   The kids are asleep...

		She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
		looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Jack.  I said the kids 
			   are asleep...

					JACK
				(distracted)
			   Well thats just 
			   great...those little 
			   monkeys can be a real 
			   handful...

		Kate shuts off the TV.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Hey!  I was watching 
			   that!

					KATE
			   I thought we had a deal 
			   about you watching CNBC 
			   in bed.

					JACK
			   Im working on a new deal 
			   now...

		Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the 
		CD player.

					KATE
			   Fine, but not tonight...

		She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

					JACK
			   Wait a second.  You want 
			   me, dont you?

					KATE
			   That is the general idea, 
			   yes...

		Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little 
		uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
		a little nervous.

					JACK
			   Shouldnt we grab some 
			   dinner first?  Maybe a 
			   bottle of wine...?

					KATE
			   Its ten thirty, Jack.  
			   By eleven youre gonna be 
			   sprawled out on the bed 
			   snoring your head off.  
			   We dont have time for 
			   wining and dining.

					JACK
			   Whatever you say...honey.

		She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
		goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
		hes brought back to a different time and place...

		Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its 
		like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven 
		years...


					JACK (CONTD)
			   God...youre beautiful...

		She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
		compliment...

					KATE
			   Thanks, Jack...

					JACK
			   No, Im serious...youre 
			   really stunning...

					KATE
			   This is good stuff, Jack, 
			   keep it coming...

					JACK
			   I mean back in college, 
			   you were a very pretty 
			   girl, theres no question 
			   about that.  But this...
				(lost in her)
			   ...youve really grown 
			   into a beautiful woman...

		Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
		reacting to the intensity in his stare...

					KATE
			   How can you do that?

					JACK
				(nervous)
			   Do what?

					KATE
			   Look at me like you 
			   havent seen me every day 
			   for the last twelve 
			   years...

		Jack freezes.  Theres love in her eyes but its not 
		meant for him...

		She kisses him...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont move.

		She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

		He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

		He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

		Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
		bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

		At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
		turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

		She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
		light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
		sweetly on the neck...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   night, honey...

		Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he 
		opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
		his face...

		CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT

		DISSOLVE TO:

    61	EXT. MALL - DAY

		Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
		gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
		lot.

    62	INT. MACYS, MENS DEPT. - DAY

		Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies 
		hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging 
		behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
		beleaguered look on his face.

					KATE
				(back to Jack)
			Were almost done here...

					ANNIE
			Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
			promised.

					KATE
			Thats right.  Okay, 
			lets make a quick stop 
			at the kids shoe 
			department, pick up my 
			watch from the battery 
			place, then Ill run into 
			the linen store...

		An unhappy look on Jacks face.

					JACK
			Why dont we just go to 
			all the stores?!

		Kate looks back at Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Every single store in 
			this godforsaken shopping 
			mall.  We can go to them 
			all.

		Kate gives him a look.  Then...

					KATE
			You know what, Jack?!  
			Ill go with the kids.  
			Why dont you just hang 
			out here in the mens 
			department... okay?

		Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
		nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
		it...

		...the Zegna section.  Hes drawn to the neat rows of 
		beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

		He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
		gently touching the soft wool.

					SALESMAN (O.S.)
			Its perfect for your 
			frame...

		Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

					SALESMAN 
			Would you like to try it 
			on?

		CUT TO:

    63	INT. MACYS MENS DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
		perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
		line is dazzling.

		Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
		out... its like hes seeing his old self...

					KATE (O.S.)
			You look amazing in that 
			suit...

		Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
		behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
		away.
					KATE
			I mean...wow...off the 
			charts great.

					JACK
			Its an unbelievable 
			thing.  Wearing this suit 
			actually makes me feel 
			like a better person.
				(taking one final 
				 look)
			Im gonna buy it...

		Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

					KATE
			$2,400?!  Are you out of 
			your mind?

					JACK
				(pointing to Annies 
				 new Mary Janes)
			She got those shoes...

					KATE
			Those shoes were twenty 
			five dollars.  Cmon, 
			take it off.  Well go to 
			the food court and get 
			one of those funnel cakes 
			you like.

		Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.

					JACK
			No.

		Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

					KATE
			No?

					JACK
			Do you have any idea what 
			my life is like?

					KATE
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			I wake up in the morning 
			covered in dog saliva...I 
			drop the kids off, spend 
			eight hours selling tires 
			retail...retail, Kate.

		Kate just stands here, aghast...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I pick up the kids, walk
			the dog, which by the 
			way, carries the added 
			bonus of carting away her
			monstrous crap...I play 
			with the kids, take out 
			the garbage, get six 
			hours of sleep if Im 
			lucky, and then it starts 
			all over again...and why 
			is it that I always have 
			to drive everyone 
			everywhere?  I spend 
			practically my entire day 
			in that slow as hell 
			mini-van listening to 
			Raffi tapes and trying to 
			figure out how the cup 
			holders work...Im sick 
			of it.

					KATE
			Really.

					JACK
			Whats in it for me?  
			Where are my Mary Janes?

		Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

					KATE
			Its sad to hear your 
			life is such a 
			disappointment to you, 
			Jack.

					JACK
			I cant believe its not 
			a disappointment to you!
				(letting it all out)
			Jesus, Kate, I couldve 
			been a thousand times the 
			man I became.  How could 
			you do this to me?  How 
			could you let me give up 
			on my dreams like this?!

		Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

					KATE
			Who are you?

		Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

					JACK
				(lowering his voice)
			Look, Im sorry.  Im 
			sorry I was such a saint 
			before and Im such a 
			prick now.  Maybe Im 
			just not the same guy I 
			was when we got 
			married...

					KATE
			Maybe youre not.  The 
			Jack Campbell I married 
			wouldnt need a $2400 
			suit to make himself feel 
			better about his life, 
			but if thats what its 
			gonna take, then buy it.  
			Just buy the goddamn 
			suit ...we can take the 
			money out of the kids 
			college fund.

		They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

					JACK
			Forget it...
				(taking off the 
				 jacket)
			Well get a funnel cake.  
			Itll be the highlight of 
			my week...

    64	EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

		The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65	INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

		Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
		wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
		on her face...
 
		CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

		Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
		in the back, both asleep...

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Listen, Im sorry about 
			that back in the store.  
			I really dont want to 
			fight with you...

		Kate just keeps looking out the window.

					JACK (CONTD)
			But you must sometimes 
			wonder how we ended up 
			here.  I mean back in 
			college, did you see 
			us...
				(looking around)
			...here...?

		She turns to him.

					KATE
			Ill give you this, life 
			has thrown us a few 
			surprises...

		A glimmer in Jacks eye...

					JACK
			It really has, hasnt 
			it?  So if you had 
			to...what would you say 
			was the biggest surprise?

		She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

					KATE
			Well...Annie for one.

					JACK
			Surprise.  Were 
			pregnant...
				(a laugh)
			Yeah...that mustve 
			been...I mean that was 
			very unexpected.  But 
			what are you gonna do, 
			right?

					KATE
			I think it worked out 
			okay, dont you?

					JACK
			Sure.  I really like 
			Annie.

					KATE
			Good, Jack.  Maybe well 
			keep her.

					JACK
			No, I love Annie.  We had 
			a lot of good times, 
			didnt we?

					KATE
			We were young...
				(a nostalgic smile)
			Remember that little 
			place on Charles Street 
			we used to go to?

					JACK
			Charles Street?  In the 
			Village?  When we were 
			living in Greenwich 
			Village...?
				(off her nod)
			Great times.  Whyd we 
			ever leave?

					KATE
			You cant really raise a 
			kid in an apartment in 
			the Village...

		Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

					KATE (CONTD)
			The trek out to the 
			hospital every day didnt 
			help either...
				(looking at him)
			You were great.  
			Surviving the heart 
			attack was one thing...

					JACK
			You had a heart attack?

					KATE
				(a laugh)
			Jack, stop that. I'm
			still mad at you...
				(a sigh)
			...who knows what 
			wouldve happened if you 
			hadnt stepped in at the 
			store.

					JACK
			Thats why I work for Big 
			Ed?

		A look from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			I mean, thats why I work 
			for Big Ed...

		Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
		together in his mind.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(almost to himself)
			So we had a baby, Big Ed 
			had a heart attack, we b
			ought that house, and 
			Ive been working for him 
			ever since...Sayonara, 
			Wall Street.

		Kate looks at him a little strangely.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(turning to her)
			Our life in a nutshell...

					KATE
			If you want to look at it 
			that way...

					JACK
			How would you look at it?

		She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
		Jack.

					KATE
			A great success story...

		A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
		cant bring himself to share it.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    66	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

		A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

		Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
		nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
		pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
		down the lane...

		Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
		gutter.

					JACK
			Damn...

					ARNIE
				(O.S., from behind)
			Jesus, Jack, this is a 
			league match, for gods 
			sake!

		Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
		scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
		sport.  Jack scowls.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wheres your follow 
			through?  Wheres your 
			stance?

					JACK
			Hey, Im doing the best I 
			can...
				(under his breath)
			Id like to see you hit a 
			squash ball after 
			seventeen beers...

					ARNIE
			Youre right.  Why am I 
			so competitive!?  
			Compensation, I guess.  
			Look, just focus, Jack.  
			You can still pick up the 
			spare...

		Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
		concentrating...

					JACK
				(quietly, to 
				 himself)
			You are Jack Campbell.  
			Youre better than this 
			sport.  You shot the 
			rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
			with the bulls at 
			Pamplona.  You jumped out 
			of a plane over the 
			Mojave Desert, for 
			Christs sake.  You can 
			do this...

		Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
		ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
		can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
		others.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(screaming, excited)
			Yeah!!

		He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
		less...

					ARNIE
				(to TEAMMATE)
			Okay, Pete, youre up.

    67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

		Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the 
		lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
		woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
		bowling ball to a far lane.

					EVELYN
			Hi Jack...

		A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Evelyn, right?

					EVELYN
			Very funny.  I saw you 
			out there on lane five.  
			What do you have the flu 
			or something?

					JACK
			Something like that.

					EVELYN
				(with a wink)
			Need a nurse?

					JACK
			Youre a nurse?

		Evelyn laughs.

					EVELYN
			If thats what you 
			want...

		She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
		follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

					JACK
			Wait a second...

		She turns.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Are we...?

					EVELYN
			Are we what, Jack?

					JACK
			Is there something going 
			on between us?

		Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.  She stands 
		there a beat, then walks back toward him.

					EVELYN
			Are we finally being 
			honest?

					JACK
			It would help me if we 
			were.

					EVELYN
			Okay, youre right, weve 
			been dancing around this 
			for years...

		Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
		face.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			God, my heart is racing.  
			Here goes...
				(a smile)
			When I get dressed for a 
			party and I know youre 
			going to be there... 
			well, lets just say I 
			dont go strapless 
			because my husband likes 
			it...

		An intrigued smile from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			Ive got six sets of snow 
			tires piled up in my 
			garage and I wont even 
			drive in the snow...And 
			our kids just happen to 
			be in the same ballet 
			class every year?

		She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			So, if youre asking me 
			whether Id like it to be 
			more, the answer is 
			yes...

		A look of surprise from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			...and Kate would never 
			have to know.

		Jack considers this for a moment.

					JACK
			Do I have your number?

		A wide smile from Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			Steves out of town with 
			the kids this week.  Why 
			dont you just stop by...

		She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
		sashay back to her lane.

    68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
		over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.

					ARNIE
				(looking at Jack)
			Hey Jack, youre all 
			flush.  I guess that 
			seventy-one took a lot 
			outta you.

					JACK
				(sitting down)
			I just saw Evelyn 
			Thompson.

					ARNIE
			She is relentless.

					JACK
			She wants to have an 
			affair with me.

					ARNIE
			She said that?

					JACK
			Pretty much.

					ARNIE
			Oh yeah...
				(shaking his head)
			What is it about you?

					JACK
				(pushing over a 
				 napkin)
			So could you write down 
			her exact address?

					ARNIE
			Whoa...whoa...wait a 
			second, Jack.  Youre not 
			actually gonna cheat on 
			Kate?

					JACK
			It wouldnt really be 
			cheating...
				(off Arnies 
				 doubtful  look)
			Its complicated.

					ARNIE
			Look, maybe Im not as 
			good a consigliere as you 
			are but you have to trust 
			me on this one.  A little 
			flirtations harmless but 
			youre playing with fire 
			here.  The Fidelity Bank 
			and Trust is a tough 
			creditor.  You make a 
			deposit somewhere else, 
			they close your account 
			forever.

					JACK
			Im telling you, those 
			rules dont apply to me, 
			Arn.

					ARNIE
				(a chuckle)
			Screw the rules.  Im 
			talking about the choice.

		Jack looks at him curiously.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons 
			got no class.  She 
			doesnt marry Dr. Steve, 
			the womans living in a 
			trailer.

					JACK
			Hey, is that really 
			necessary?

					ARNIE
			All Im saying it there 
			isnt a guy in Union 
			County who wouldnt give 
			his left nut to be 
			married to Kate...

		Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Ill see ya later, 
			Jack...

		He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

		CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
		dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
		kitchen where...

		Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
		some legal documents.

					KATE
				(not looking up)
			How was the game, honey?

					JACK
				(opening the fridge)
			Long, boring, and 
			generally pretty sad.  
			Arnie seemed to enjoy 
			it...
				(peering inside)
			Hey, wheres that chocolate 
			cake...?

		Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
		cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
		into her mouth.

					KATE
				(with a smile)
			You mean this chocolate 
			cake?

					JACK
			Thats my piece.  I was 
			saving it because I got 
			nauseated from that store 
			bought chicken.

		Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
		the side of her mouth.

					KATE
			Its good...

		Jack approaches the counter.

					JACK
			Gimme that cake.

		She takes another bite.

					KATE
			No way.

		He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
		where he cant reach it.

					JACK
			Cmon.

					KATE
			Sorry, Jack.  Its too 
			important to me.

		They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

		He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
		chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
		laughing...

		Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
		house... just about the catch up to her when...

		She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
		her...

					JACK
			I want that cake!

		...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
		playfully on top of him...

					KATE
				(laughing)
			You want the cake!?

					JACK
				(out of breath)
			I want it...

		She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
		hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

		Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Thank you...

					KATE
			Its good, right?

		He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
		mouth.

		They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
		each other cake, laughing.

		Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kates 
		face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
		realizes...

		...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Are the kids asleep?

		A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
		passionately right there on the steps...its heating 
		up...

					KATE
				(caught up in the 
				 moment)
			Say it, Jack...

					JACK
			What...?

					KATE
			Cmon, you know what I 
			like to hear...

					JACK
				(in the throes 
				 of passion)
			Yeah, baby, I know what 
			you like to hear...

					KATE
				(kissing him)
			Then say it...just say it 
			to me...!

					JACK
				(swept up in the 
				 moment)
			Oh yeah, youre a bad 
			girl, baby... You make me 
			so hot...Im gonna take 
			you to that special 
			place...

		Kate pulls away.

					KATE
			What...?

		Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
		passion drain from her face...

					JACK
			Not it...?

					KATE
			Nice, Jack.  Youre 
			sweeping me off my feet.

					JACK
			What? You make me hot...

		She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
		the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
		he feels something licking at his hand...

		He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
		wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive 
		gotta go look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
		then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of 
			us can get a little 
			relief tonight...

		He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
		familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

		...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...

		Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
		decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
		curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

		Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
		house...

		He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
		outline of a woman reading by the window...

		EVELYN THOMPSON...

		Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
		nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

		He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
		doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it 
		there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
		reason he cant bring himself to push it...

		He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
		the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

					JACK
				(pulling the leash)
			Cmon, girl, lets go 
			home...

    71	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

		The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
		leash, his face red from the cold outside.

		He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
		coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

		He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
		rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

		CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES

		He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

		He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
		expressions...

		He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
		marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and 
		Joshs 1st Birthday.  He runs his fingers along the 
		tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.  His 
		eyes linger there a moment...

		He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

		ON TV:

		Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers 
		house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
		cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.

		The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

		Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
		music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

					ARNIE (O.S.)
			Jesus, Bill, this thing 
			is an antique.  Dont you 
			even have image 
			stabilization?

		Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

					BILL KRAMER
			Four hundred bucks at Best 
			Buy, Arn.

		Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
		face.

					JACK
			And everyone knows image 
			stabilization is for the 
			weak...

		Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

		Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
		putting an arm around Jack...

					ARNIE
			So Jack, its your wifes 
			birthday, got anything to 
			say to her?

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Its your birthday?  
			Today?  Whats your 
			name?  Where were you 
			born?

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Wait a minute.  Youre my 
			wife?

		She slaps him playfully on the arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I do have one thing I 
			wanna say...

		Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(singing to her)
			Oh those fingers in my 
			hair, that sly come 
			hither stare, strips my 
			conscience bare, its 
			witchcraft... 

		Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but 
		hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
		to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
		guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

		Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and Ive got no 
			defense for it, that heat 
			is too intense for it, 
			what good would common 
			sense for it do...

		Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
		basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he 
		goes along...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Cause its 
			witchcraft, wicked 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...when you rouse 
			the need in me, my heart 
			says yes indeed in me, 
			proceed with what youre 
			leadin me to...

		The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
		crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
		in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the mens faces 
		as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

		A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
		jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
		captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

		Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
		of the gathered guests... 

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch, there aint 
			no nicer witch than 
			you...

		Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But its no 
		longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...

		Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
		watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
		Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
		and walks toward the kitchen...

		Jack raises an eyebrow...

		In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have 
		a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
		verse...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause its witchcraft, 
			that koo koo 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...

		The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
		getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
		unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
		along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him, 
		revering him...

		Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
		underestimated his alter ego...

		On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...when you rouse the 
			need in me, my heart says 
			yes indeed to me, proceed 
			with what youre leadin 
			me to...

		Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch...

		Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
		the crowd.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause theres no nicer 
			witch than you...

		Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...

		Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
		connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

		Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
		completely in the palm of Jacks hand...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
		builds to a crescendo...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
		out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

		Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
		the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

		Back on video...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(speaking quietly 
				 to Kate)
			Happy Birthday 
			sweetheart...I love you.

		Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
		AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
		own little world...

		Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
		fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

		A tear at the corner of his eye...

		The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the 
		video continues...

		Hes left standing there...silent, still...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    72	INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

		Lucy licking Jacks face.  Jack pushes the dog 
		away...as...

		The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

					KATE
				(groggy)
			Time to get up, honey...

		Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
		putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
		practically half-asleep.

    73	INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the kitchen.

		He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
		fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
		heads upstairs.

    74	INT. JOSHS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...into Joshs room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
		in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

		Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
		and then walks out of the room...

		CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
		the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
		smile on her face.

		Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
		behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to 
		Kate.

					KATE
			Happy Anniversary, 
			honey...

		Terror on Jacks face.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(pushing the gift 
				 forward)
			Before you do whatever 
			crazy stunt youve got 
			planned I want you to 
			open mine...

		Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

					JACK
			Maybe I should wait...

					KATE
			No, open it...

		He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
		revealing...

		...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
		suit...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it at an outlet 
			store.  I know its a 
			knock-off, but I think 
			itll look great on 
			you...

					JACK
				(examining the label)
			Zeena...

		Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but 
		this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done 
		for him...

					JACK (CONTD) 
				(tearing up)
			You really are 
			incredible...

					KATE
			Enjoy it, sweetheart...

		Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly 
		remembering how truly screwed he is.

					JACK
			Youre probably expecting 
			something from me...

		Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
		look on her face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Heres the thing.  I 
			really hadnt planned on 
			giving you your...uh... 
			anniversary gift until 
			tonight.
				(an uncomfortable 
				 smile)
			You know, anniversarys 
			good all day...

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about?  You never wait 
			all day.  You can barely 
			wait until its light 
			out.

					JACK
			I know that, but...

		Beat.  Kate looks at him like shes looking into his 
		soul.

					KATE
			You forgot.

		Jack stands there, silent.

					KATE (CONTD)
			You actually forgot our 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Ill fix it.  Ill go out 
			right now and get you 
			something.  Ill make it 
			right.

		That didnt help.

					KATE
				(holding back 
				 the tears)
			Jesus, Jack...Is this 
			where we are now?  Is 
			this our marriage?  
			Suddenly Im the wife who 
			has to drop hints two 
			weeks before her 
			anniversary so her 
			husband doesnt fuck it 
			up?

		Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
		his...

					JACK
			Please dont cry...

		Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

					KATE
				(shaking her head, 
				 crying)
			I dont want to be that, 
			Jack...

		Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
		it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

		Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...

		CUT TO:

    76	INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

		Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
		for some air...

		He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
		pity on his face.

		He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the 
		porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
		handle bar.

		He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
		RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone 
		to appear ...but theres no one.  He RINGS the bell 
		again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
		someones attention.

					JACK
			Cmon...cmon...

		Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
		RINGING the bell with everything hes got...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(shouting to the 
				 sky)
			Cmon, goddamnit, how was 
			I supposed to know the 
			date of their 
			anniversary!?  I never 
			married her!

		Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

					ANNIE
				(slowly)
			Put the bicycle back on 
			the ground...

		Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

		Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
		folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
		the glass to her.

		She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
		milk mustache on her lip.

					ANNIE
			Not bad...I shoulda 
			warned you.  Dad always 
			does something really 
			special for their 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Like what?

					ANNIE
			One year he had a solar 
			system named after her...

					JACK
			Dont you think thats a 
			little gimmicky?

					ANNIE
			Mom liked it.

		Jack raises an eyebrow.

					JACK
			Maybe theres a jewelry 
			store back at the mall.  
			I could get her a pair of 
			earrings or something.

					ANNIE
			Thats good but...you did 
			forget the anniversary.

					JACK
			Right.  Thats a major 
			oversight...
				(thinking aloud)
			So if Im Kate...I cant 
			really afford the finer 
			things, my husbands 
			career is a crushing 
			disappointment to me, 
			Im trapped in suburbia...

		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Did he ever take her to 
			the City?

		Annie smiles, impressed.

					ANNIE
			Youre really gettin the 
			hang of this.

		Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.  
		For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78	INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

		Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
		dressed.

		Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
		carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
		little black one.

		Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

					KATE
			Which do you think?

		Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
		seriously...

					ANNIE
			The black one...

		Kate nods.  Shes about to put it on when she looks at 
		Annie...

					KATE
			Fightings a part of it, 
			Annie.  You know that, 
			right?

					ANNIE
			Im not worried, Mom.  
			Hes still learning our 
			ways...

		Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
		Its true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
		hand to Annie.

					KATE
			Cmere.

		Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
		lipstick...

					ANNIE
				(excited)
			Really?

		Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies 
		lips.

					KATE
			Now go like this...

		Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
		it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her  
		Annies beaming.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Youre gonna break a lot 
			of hearts, you know.

		A smile from Annie...

		Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
		watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80	EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

		A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
		lined lower Manhattan street.

    81	INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

		Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  Its not a 
		Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

		He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
		restaurant...

		He helps her off with her coat.  Kates wearing the 
		sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
		effectiveness...

					JACK
			You look beautiful...

		A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

		Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(instinctively)
			Thanks, Catherine...

		Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
		him a pat on the back...

					KATE
			You okay?

		He takes Kate by the arm...

					JACK
			Fine...

		He leads her to the main room.

		She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
		country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

					KATE
				(quietly to Jack)
			Jack...can we afford all 
			this?

					JACK
			Whats the difference?  
			Im taking my baby out 
			for our anniversary, damn 
			the costs...

					KATE
			How do you even know 
			about this place?

		Jacks caught for a moment.  Then...

					JACK
			Arnie...
				(insistent)
			Arnie.  Hell throw you a 
			curve ball once in a 
			while, thats for sure...

		Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
		cheek...

    82	INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
		standing next to them.  Jacks not even looking at the menu.

					JACK
			Well have the tureen of 
			quail breast with 
			shiitake mushrooms to 
			start, then the veal 
			medallions in raspberry 
			truffle sauce and the sea 
			scallops with pureed 
			artichoke hearts...sea 
			scallops, North of the 
			Caspian...

		Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
		her face.

					WAITER
			Very good, sir.  And may 
			I say those are all 
			excellent selections.

					JACK
			You may...
				(perusing the 
				 wine list)
			Also, well have a bottle 
			of Lafite, 1982.

		Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
		it upside down.

					KATE
			Its five hundred and 
			fifty dollars, Jack!

		A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
		perfect.

					JACK
			Just a glass of red wine 
			for each of us...

		The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

					KATE
			You are so not off the 
			hook yet, slick.

					JACK
			But Im gettin close, right?

		A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
		look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You want to dance?

		A puzzled look from Kate.  Theres nobody else 
		dancing.  There isnt even much room to dance...

					KATE
			I dont think theres 
			dancing here, Jack.

		Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

					JACK
			Sure there is...

		Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

		Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
		arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
		confident and self-assured.

		The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
		in this romantic moment.

		Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
		They look good together...in sync with each other...

		People are watching them...some of the men are 
		impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
		clearly charmed...

					KATE
				(whispering to 
				 Jack)
			Pretty good for a tire 
			salesman from Jersey...

		Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

					JACK
			I have my moments...

		They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

		Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
		Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
		She takes a bite.

					KATE
			Mmmm...
				(spearing a scallop)
			...here, try one of 
			these...

		Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.

					JACK
				(savoring the scallop) 
			God I missed that 
			taste...

		Kate laughs.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Why are you laughing?

		Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
		at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
		fork.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I need to tell you 
			something.

					KATE
			Okay...

					JACK
			I think it may help us 
			but theres a slight 
			chance it could make 
			things worse.

		She hears the seriousness in his voice.

					KATE
			Now Im worried...just 
			say it.  Whatever it is 
			well deal with it.

					JACK
			Are you sure?

		She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I feel like Im living 
			someone elses life...

		Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
		nods reassuringly.  He continues...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I used to be so sure 
			about everything, you 
			know?  I knew exactly who 
			I was and what I wanted.  
			Then one morning I woke 
			up and suddenly it was 
			all different...

					KATE
			Worse, you mean...

					JACK
			No.  Well, maybe a few 
			things.  But mostly just 
			different...

		Jack lets out a small smile.  Now hes the one whos 
		reassuring Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I never used to be like 
			this, Kate.  I had it all 
			figured out.  No doubts, 
			no regrets.

					KATE
			And now...?

					JACK
			Now...I dont...

		He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
		desperate for understanding.

					KATE
			Me neither.

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think its good to be a 
			little unsure about who 
			you are.  Its very 
			human.

					JACK
			But you always seem so 
			certain.

					KATE
			Cmon, Jack, you think 
			there arent mornings 
			when I wake up and wonder 
			what the hell Im doing 
			in New Jersey...

					JACK
			Thats a big one for me, 
			too.

					KATE
			My office is a dump, I 
			answer my own phone...and 
			youve seen my pay check.

					JACK
			Your pay check is a 
			disgrace to pay checks.

					KATE
			I mean yes, I help people 
			that need it...

					JACK
			I guess...some of them 
			are probably faking.

					KATE
				(a laugh, then...)
			God, sometimes I think it 
			would be so nice not to 
			have to stretch ground 
			beef or maybe drive a car 
			with a CD player...

		He smiles, right there with her.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Imagine having a life 
			where everything was 
			easy...where you asked 
			for things and people 
			just brought them to 
			you...

					JACK
			Its wonderful...

		Kate laughs, nodding.

		A pause, then...

					KATE
			I think about it, too, 
			Jack.  I do.  I think 
			about the kind of person 
			Id be if I hadnt 
			married you...

		Its as if shes inside his head.  They stay like this 
		for a moment, looking into each other.

					JACK
			And...?

		She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

					KATE
			And I realize Ive just 
			erased the things in my 
			life Im most sure 
			about.  You, the kids...

		Jack nods.

					JACK
			Good things...

					KATE
			What are you sure about?

		Jack looks into Kates eyes.

					JACK
			Im sure that right now 
			theres nowhere Id 
			rather be than here with 
			you...

		Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  Its been 
		a while.

		CUT TO:

    84	EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

		The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
		the square.  Its like something out of a Henry James 
		novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85	INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

		The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
		enters...

		Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
		furniture...its like walking into another world...

					KATE
			This is so beautiful...

		Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
		silver ice bucket...

					KATE (CONTD)
			You know champagne makes 
			me do crazy things.

					JACK
				(pouring)
			Ill just full yours up 
			to the top.
				(handing her a 
				 glass)
			Happy anniversary, 
			sweetheart.

		Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.

					KATE
			I dont know how you did 
			it, hoss, but you pulled 
			it off.

					JACK
			Im out of the doghouse?

					KATE
			Way out...

		Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
		size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
		her...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to him)
			You may even get lucky 
			tonight...

		Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
		the powerful effect it has on him.

		Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
		in her.

					JACK
			Youre so...beautiful...

					KATE
			I already told you you 
			were gonna get lucky, 
			Jack...

		They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

		Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

					JACK
			My god, all this time...I 
			never stopped loving 
			you...

					KATE
				(a wide smile) 
			Thats all I wanted to 
			hear...

		She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
		caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
		behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    86	INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

		Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

		Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a 
		contented smile on her face...

		Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
		at Kate.

		Theres something different in his eyes...something 
		deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of 
		smile.

		Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.

					KATE
			Mmmm...Jack...

		Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I feel like I should give 
			you money...

		Jack laughs.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I mean, my god, Jack you 
			were always good but 
			this...this was... like a 
			porno movie.

		Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at 
		Washington Square through the window.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I could stay here 
			forever...

					JACK
			I dont think Id fight 
			you on that one...

		Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
		kiss.

    87	EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

		The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to 
		Teaneck.

    88	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

		Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
		practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on 
		MUSIC, but not quite...

		She walks into the kitchen where...

		Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
		Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

		He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
		strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
		goes back to his paper.

    89	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
		sleeve oxford...

   89A	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		The front door of the Campbell House...

		Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
		a bagel in his mouth...

		He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
		slowly behind him...

		In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
		in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
		heads to the car.

		Then...a smile from Kate...

		In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
		into Kates arms...

		...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
		post...

					KATE
			Have a good day...

		A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
		him on his way...

    90	EXT. BIG EDS - AFTERNOON

		Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
		a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
		of high top Nike Air Jordans.

					JACK
			For the money, theyre 
			hands down the best 
			radial we carry...

					MAN
				(thinking, then...)
			Okay, Ill take them...

					JACK
			You wont regret it...
				(shouting to Tommy)
			Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
			with four B.F. Goodrich 
			G-Force T/As...
				(looking the man 
				 over)
			...and give him ten 
			percent off for having 
			the best costume...

		Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
		the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack, Kate on line two!  
			Jack pick up two!

		Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
		back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

		Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

					KENNY
				(walking out to Jack)
			Kates on two, Jack.
				(on seeing the Rolls)
			Nice ride...

					JACK
				(staring at Lassiter)
			If youre into that kind 
			of conspicuous 
			consumption...

					KENNY
			You want me to handle 
			him?  I think Im 
			ready...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack!  Kate still holding 
			on line two...

					JACK
			Sure...be careful, he 
			looks like a tough 
			negotiator...

		Jack walks inside...

    91	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the 
		window, cant take his eyes off him...

		He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
		blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
		Lassiter...

		...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
		phone...

		But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(to Estelle, into 
				 intercom)
			Tell Kate Ill call her 
			back...

		INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

					ESTELLE 
				(into intercom)
			It sounded pretty 
			important.

					JACK
				(into intercom)
			Im with a customer.  
			Ill call her back.

		He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
		outside the store...

		CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

					LASSITER
				(to Kenny)
			I seem to have had some 
			kind of blow out...

		Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK
			Why dont you let me take 
			this one, Kenny?

					KENNY
			Okay, chief.

		Kenny nods then heads back inside...

					JACK
			Peter Lassiter...

					LASSITER
				(surprised)
			Do I know you?

					JACK
			Not exactly. Ive seen you 
			on CNBC.
				(with a smile)
			You look taller in real 
			life...

		CUT TO:

    93	INT. BIG EDS TIRED, JACKS OFFICE - LATE

		Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
		cluttered, cramped office.

					JACK
			...truth is, Mintz was so 
			busy timing his wifes 
			breathing he didnt see 
			that MedTech needed 
			Global more than the 
			other way around.  Ten 
			days, two weeks tops, 
			they wouldve approached 
			you with an offer, and 
			Id bet anything it 
			wouldve been thirty 
			billion, not twenty 
			nine...
				(a knowing smile)
			Problem was, Peter, you 
			had a pussycat running 
			the show. What you needed 
			was a rottweiler.

		Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
		an intrigued look on his face...

					LASSITER
				(nodding)
			Well, Im impressed.

		A smile from Jack.

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			I really am...

		Jack savors the moment, until...

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			So, about my car...

		Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

					JACK
			Sure. Were going to 
			have to special order 
			that tire. Itll be 
			ready in about two days.

		Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
		wallet.

					LASSITER
			This has my office address 
			on it...
				(thinking, then...)
			Why dont you drop it off 
			yourself?

		A smile from Jack.

		CUT TO:

    94	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JACKS BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate, sound asleep in bed...

		Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in

    95	INT. BIG EDS, JACKS OFFICE - DAY

		Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
		distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
		GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

					HECTOR
			...I say to her, Margarita, 
			we already have four kids, 
			why do we need more?

		Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
		eyes the door...
					
					HECTOR (CONTD)
			But she say she want an 
			even number. I say four 
			is an even number! But 
			she say she want six.

		Jack checks his watch...

					HECTOR (CONTD)
			I tell her, Margarita, I 
			just got my green card, 
			I like to sit back and 
			rest a little bit...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			Hector...do I usually 
			listen to your personal 
			problems?

					HECTOR 
			Sure, Jack, all the time...

		Jack nods, then...

					JACK
			Look, I have some business 
			that I have to take care 
			of in the city so Im 
			leaving early...
				(getting up)
			My advice to you...follow 
			your dreams.

		CUT TO:

    96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

		Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...

		He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
		good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
		skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
		inside...

    96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
		SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes 
		crazy...

    97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Lassiter walk together...

					LASSITER
			...were really more of a 
			boutique operation, as 
			you can see...

					JACK
			But youre not interested 
			in boutique dollars...
				(a smile)
			I get it...

		They walk into...

    98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Past the assistants desk...

					MINTZS ASSISTANT
				(seeing Lassiter)
			Hes expecting you, Mr. 
			Lassiter...

		Lassiter doesnt even slow down...

    99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from 
		the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
		play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
		immediately struck by the difference...

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, this is Jack 
			Campbell...the one I was 
			telling you about...

		Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
		desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.

					ALAN
			Jack, of course.

		They shake hands.

					JACK
				(appropriately 
				 deferential)
			Mr. Mintz.

					ALAN
			Please, call me Alan. We 
			try to cultivate a casual 
			atmosphere around here...

					JACK
				(re: play pen)
			I can see that, Alan.

		A chuckle from Mintz.

					ALAN
			You have kids, Jack?

					JACK
				(hesitating, then...)
			Uh...actually, yes. Two...
			good ones.

		Another laugh from Mintz.

					ALAN
			Thats great...
				(gesturing to 
				 the sofa)
			Why dont you have a seat?

		Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
		Lassiter take the chairs.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			So, Peter mentioned that 
			you were an avid CNBC 
			watcher but didnt say 
			whether you had any 
			actual Wall Street 
			experience?

		Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not 
		realizing he was walking into an interview...

		He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

					JACK
			I was a sales associate, 
			at E.F. Hutton.

					ALAN
			A broker? Really. And now 
			youre in the tire 
			business?

					JACK
			Thats right. And auto 
			supply...

					ALAN
			Uh huh. The retail end, I 
			understand.

		Jack nods...

					JACK
			Uh...we actually get about 
			sixty percent of our 
			business from automotive 
			service.

					ALAN
			Mind if I ask what kind of 
			sales you did last year? 
			Ballpark...

					JACK
			We did one point seven 
			million in total revenue...

					ALAN
			Uh huh...one point seven.  
			And what do you project for 
			this year?

		Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
		questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...


					ALAN (CONTD)
			Any thoughts at all on 
			that?

		As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
		of his handicap...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack?

		He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
		then ...a confident smile.

					JACK
			Well, Alan, I think were 
			gonna have a banner year.  
			Sales are up almost 
			twenty percent in the 
			first quarter and we just 
			landed a major trucking 
			company account.

					ALAN
			Really. So youre 
			projecting what, a tad 
			over two million?

		A gleam in Jacks eye.

					JACK
			Thats right. And that 
			would make us number one 
			in our market...
				(getting up)
			You mind if I stand?

		A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

		Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
		crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
		water...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Look, I know our paltry 
			little two million in 
			sales is about what you 
			spend on office supplies 
			in a year.  And I know 
			some regional trucking 
			company account is 
			nothing compared to a 
			sixty billion dollar 
			merger...

					ALAN
			Im not trying to knock 
			the tire business, Jack.

					JACK
				(a confident chuckle)
			Its okay, Alan. I get it. 
			Im in your shoes, Im 
			thinking exactly the same 
			thing...but heres the 
			thing. Business is 
			business.  Wall Street, 
			Main Street, its all 
			just a bunch of people 
			getting up in the morning, 
			trying to figure out how 
			the hell theyre gonna 
			send their kids to 
			college.  Its just 
			people...

		Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
		appears intrigued...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And I know people.

					ALAN
			Im sure you do...

					LASSITER
				(intervening)
			Lets let the man have 
			his say...

		Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

					JACK
				(to Mintz)
			Take you, for instance...

					ALAN
				(defensive)
			What about me?

					JACK
			You drink about sixteen 
			Diet Cokes a day. Youre 
			an excellent father, but 
			you feel guilty about the 
			time you spend away from 
			home. You drink bourbon, 
			but you offer your 
			clients scotch...

		Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And your wife decorated 
			this office...

		A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
		caught look on his face.

					LASSITER
			He certainly has your 
			number, Alan.

					JACK
				(turning to Lassiter)
			Youre a little tougher, 
			Peter.

		A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...

					JACK (CONTD)
			For one thing, you like 
			expensive things.

					LASSITER
				(smiling proudly) 
			Thats easy. Youve seen 
			my car.

					JACK
				(a chuckle)
			Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
			Monterreys. Youre a 
			scotch man, single malt, 
			not because its trendy 
			but because youve been 
			doing it for forty years, 
			and you stay with what 
			works. You have two great 
			loves in your life, your 
			horses and this company.  
			You wept openly the day 
			the Dow hit ten thousand...

		Lassiters impressed.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And youre a man who 
			prides himself on finding 
			talent in unusual 
			places...


					LASSITER
			Oh? And how would you 
						know that?

		Jack smiles.

					JACK
			Because Im here.

		On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
		smile.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Im prepared to do 
			anything it takes to get 
			this job. Start anywhere 
			you need me to start.  
			Ill park cars if I 
			to...
				(into Lassiters 
				 eyes)
			The biggest part of 
			judging character is 
			knowing yourself. And I 
			know this, I can do this 
			job. Give me a chance, 
			Peter, I wont let you 
			down.

		Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a 
		moment, he turns to Mintz.

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, why dont you show 
			Jack around a bit...

					ALAN
			Id love to.

		CUT TO:

    100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
		EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
		back...

					ALAN
				(pointing)
			...thats our war room.  
			We did seven major deals 
			last year, three of them 
			hostile.

					JACK
				(not particularly 
				 impressed)
			Seven.  Really.

		They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
		the corridor.

		Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs 
		gaze with a quizzical look.

					ALAN
			Lets cut the shit, huh 
			Campbell? What, did you go 
			through his wallet or 
			something?

		Jacks a little taken aback.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			No matter. That circus 
			act back there may have 
			dazzled Lassiter 
			momentarily but it 
			doesnt do shit forme.  
			Even if you get this job, 
			which I highly doubt, let 
			me warn you, Lassiter 
			loses interest in his pet 
			projects very quickly. 
			Im in the big office 
			because Ive proved 
			myself to him year after 
			year and nobody is going 
			to come in here and start 
			turning the old mans 
			head. Especially not some 
			tire salesman from New 
			Jersey. So you watch 
			yourself and stay away 
			from Lassiter, and maybe, 
			just maybe, Ill keep you 
			on after he gets tired of 
			you. Do we understand 
			each other?

		Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
		expressionless.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Do we?!

		Then, a broad smile from Jack.

					JACK
			God, you really are 
			different, arent you...
				(nodding)
			I mean...wow...I am 
			impressed.

		Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Good for you. Why shouldnt 
			you protect whats yours.

					ALAN
			I dont think youre hearing 
			me.

					JACK
			Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.  
			Thats not the problem.  
			The problem is that what 
			you think is yours, is 
			really mine.  And I dont 
			care how low on the totem 
			pole I start, I will get 
			it back...
				(poking him in 
				 the chest)
			So do yourself a favor and 
			dont get too attached to 
			that view because sometime 
			soon, maybe very soon, you
			and your French country 
			antiques, your chintz sofa, 
			and your little play pen 
			are gonna be moving out of 
			that office.

		Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Oh, and by the way, you 
			try selling tires for a 
			living.  I promise you, 
			youd starve.

		Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
		leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

		CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

		CUT TO:

    101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

		A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
		duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

					JACK
			Welcome to Xanadu...

		The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
		lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
		its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
		house.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Pretty incredible, isnt 
			it?

					KATE
			Its like a museum.

		Jack nods.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to Jack)
			So whats the big 
			surprise? You didnt 
			rent this place for 
			the weekend, did you?

					JACK
			Think bigger.

					KATE
			For the week?

		Jack chuckles.

					JACK
			This place is a perk, 
			Kate.

					KATE
			A perk for what?

					JACK
			A company called P.K. 
			Lassiter and Associates 
			Investment House uses it 
			to attract new 
			executives...

		Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre talking to their 
			new Vice President of 
			Mergers and Acquisitions.

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about, Jack?


					JACK
			Im going into arbitrage, 
			honey.  Turns out I have 
			a knack for it.  Ill be 
			making two hundred grand 
			a year plus a hefty bonus
			and thats just to 
			start.  And, we can live 
			in this apartment 
			practically rent free for 
			as long as we want.

		Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...

					JACK (CONTD)
			We can finally afford to 
			move back into the city.  
			In style.

		Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

					KATE
			Are you out of your mind?

					JACK
			I dont think so. This 
			is going to be a better 
			life for all of us, 
			honey.  Well put Annie 
			and Josh in private 
			schools...

					KATE
			Annie goes to a great 
			school.

					JACK
			Im talking about the 
			best schools in the 
			country here, Kate...

					KATE
			Jack, what could you 
			possibly be thinking?  
			What about my job?

					JACK
			This is New York City, 
			its like the needy 
			people capital of the 
			world.  Those Jersey 
			clients of yours arent a 
			tenth as pathetic as the 
			ones you could get 
			here...

					KATE
				(cutting him off)
			I cant believe you want 
			to move back into the 
			city.  I thought the 
			reason we left was 
			because we didnt want to 
			raise the kids here?

					JACK
			No, this is the center of 
			the universe.  If I were 
			living in Roman times, I 
			would live in Rome, where 
			else?  Today, America is 
			the Roman Empire and New 
			York is Rome itself. 
			John Lennon.

					KATE
				(cutting him off) 
			Jack.

		Jacks starting to struggle...

					JACK
			Look, Im detecting a 
			kind of funky tension 
			here...We dont have to 
			live in this apartment. 
			I dont need this...Ill 
			commute...Ill drive to 
			work...

		Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
		apart...

					KATE
			In traffic?  Its over an 
			hour each way?  Thats 
			almost three hours a 
			day.  When are you going 
			to see the kids?

		Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
		himself. Then...

					JACK
			Kate. Youre not 
			understanding me. Im 
			talking about a great 
			life.  A perfect life.  
			Everything we pictured 
			when we were young. The 
			whole package. You said 
			it yourself, life has 
			thrown us surprises, and 
			so we made sacrifices.  
			But now I can finally get 
			us back on track...

		A sad chuckle from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I can do that.  I want to 
			do that.  For all of us.  
			I need to do that as a 
			man...
				(imploring her)
			Think about it.  No more 
			lousy restaurants, no 
			more clipping coupons, no 
			more shoveling snow...

					KATE
			Then get a goddamn snow 
			blower!

		Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont get a new career 
			without even telling me.  
			Dont take Annie out of a 
			school she loves.  Dont 
			move us out of a house 
			weve become a family 
			in...

		Kate stands there, wounded...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(quietly)
			Dont do that...

					JACK
			Look, youre making this 
			into something its not. 
			This isnt a referendum 
			on our lives, Kate. Its 
			a step forward...
				(appealing to her)
			Dont you see?  Im 
			talking about us finally 
			having a life other 
			people envy.

		Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing 
		look...

					KATE
			They already do envy us, 
			Jack...

		Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    102  OMITTED

    103	INT. ANNIES ROOM - NIGHT

		Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
		walks in.

		Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
		notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

					JACK
			Very nice. What is it?

					ANNIE
			Mary Had A Little Lamb.

					JACK
			Ah. A classic...

		Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
		dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
		down its sides...

		Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally 
		contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

		Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

		Jack turns to her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please dont stop...

		She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
		to the pictures...

    104	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

		Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

		He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the 
		surface of the desk...

		He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
		bookshelf...a book...

		He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a 
		tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.  He pulls 
		it off the shelf, theres something inside...a 
		bookmark...

		...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

		...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow, 
		To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.

		He looks at it...somethings not right...

					JACK
			From London to New York...?
				(looking up)
			I came back...

		Then...a NOISE...

		Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
		standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
		ticket sleeve.

					KATE
			Our finest moment, 
			right...

		A quizzical look from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			When you got on that 
			plane I was sure it was 
			over.  I left the airport 
			afraid Id never see you 
			again.  And then you 
			showed up the very next 
			day...
				(a wistful smile)
			That was a good 
			surprise...

		She continues into the room, leaning against a 
		bookshelf.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think about you on that 
			plane, about what must 
			have been going through 
			your mind...you sitting 
			there imagining our life 
			together, our life 
			apart...I think about the 
			decision you made...

		Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Maybe I was being naive 
			but I believed wed grow 
			old together in this 
			house.  That wed spend 
			holidays here, have g
			randchildren visit us 
			here.  I had this image 
			of us all grey and 
			wrinkly, me working in 
			the garden, you 
			repainting the deck...

		Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Things change, right?  
			People change...
				(pausing)
			If you need this, Jack, I 
			mean really need this, I 
			will take these children 
			from a life they love, 
			and take myself from the 
			only home weve ever 
			shared, and move wherever 
			you need to go.  Ill do 
			that because I love 
			you...

		The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I love you, Jack. And  
			thats more important to 
			me than our address...

		Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
		kisses him gently on the forehead.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I choose us.

		She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
		the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
		her as she goes...

    105	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks into the room...

		The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

		He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

		Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
		to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
		her, drawing her in...

		In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.  He 
		savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

		They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
		person.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    106	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
		her eyes.  Jacks not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

		Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

		She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
		revealing...

		Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
		snow with Annie and Josh.

		Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
		face...

    107	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

		...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
		delight...

		The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

		The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks 
		joy is just as palpable...

		Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
		neck, hugging his tight.

					ANNIE
				(whispering in 
				 Jacks ear)
			I knew youd come back...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    108	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

		Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
		until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
		its empty...

		And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
		RINGING, echoing through the room.

		A shudder passes through his body...

		He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
		sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

		Its an eerie moment for Jack...

					JACK
			What are you doing?

					ANNIE
				(a curious look)
			Ringing my bell...

		On Jacks anxious face...

    109  OMITTED
 
		CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE

    110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

		On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
		convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
		salt...

		He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

					JACK
			Four ninety nine?! Its just 
			salt for gods sake...

		On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
		GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

		She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
		of gum...

		From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
		the counter...

		On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
		salt from the shelf, when...

					CASH (O.S.)
			Thatll be sixty five cents, 
			little angel...

		Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
		over to the front counter...where he sees...

		Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
		uniform, ringing up the teenager...

		An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

					JACK
			You...!

		Then...the color drains from Jacks face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			What are you doing here...

		Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre not sending me 
			back...

		The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
		bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
		to Cash...

					CASH
			Jack, its good to see 
			you...

		Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
		ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(to the girl)
			Thank you darlin...

		The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
		given her the wrong change...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(back to Jack, 
				 seeing the
				 rock salt)
			What do you got there, 
			rock salt?  Look at you, 
			all domestic and shit...
			You really figured some 
			things out, huh?

		The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

					JACK
			Im not going back...

		The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

					CASH 
				(to the girl)
			Everything okay...?

		She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

					TEENAGE GIRL
			Yeah...fine.

					JACK
				(raising his voice)
			Hey! Did you hear me...?!

		Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
		the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

		A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches 
		into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

		Cash looks at Jack.

					CASH 
				(making a note 
				 in his book)

			That was a character issue...
				(shaking his head)
			...and for nine dollars?  
			Thats just sad...

					JACK
			Hey, Im talking to you!  
			I am not going back, do you 
			understand...?!

		Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant do this. You 
			cant keep coming in and 
			out of peoples lives, 
			messing things up...

					CASH
			Cmon, Jack...

		Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

					JACK
			Ive got kids, Im going 
			home...

					CASH
			You know what the word 
			glimpse means, J? Its 
			by nature an impermanent 
			thing.

		Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
		turns at the door...

					JACK
				(pointing at 
				 Cash)
			Im staying.

		Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs 
		face as Jack leaves...

    111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly.

		Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
		wake him.

    112	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIES ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

					ANNIE
				(stirring, groggy)
			Is it morning yet?

					JACK
			No, honey. Go back to 
			sleep.

		She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
		looking at her, sadness all over his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Take care of yourself,
			Annie.  Im going back to 
			the mother ship...

		Finally, he turns to go...

    113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as 
		Jack walks in.

					KATE
				(looking up from 
				 her book)
			Hey...

		Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

					JACK
			These last weeks, Kate, I 
			know that Ive done 
			some...some unusual 
			things.

		Kate nods.

					KATE
			Its been interesting, 
			thats for sure.

					JACK
			But Ive done some good 
			things too, havent I?

					KATE
			Youve been Jack 
			Campbell.  And thats 
			always a good thing...

		She kisses him on the cheek.

		He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
		eyes.

					JACK
			I need you to remember 
			me, Kate.  How I am right 
			now, right this very 
			moment.  I need you to 
			put that image in your 
			heart and keep it with 
			you, no matter what 
			happens.

					KATE
			Are you okay, Jack?

					JACK
			Please, just promise me 
			youll do that. You have 
			to promise, Kate. 
			Because if you dont, 
			then its like it never 
			happened and I dont 
			think I could live with 
			that.

		Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love 
		with him.

					KATE
			I promise, Jack...

					JACK
			Promise me again...

					KATE
			I promise. Come to bed, 
			honey.

		Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

					JACK
			Soon...

    114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		Snow begins to fall...

		Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
		mind elsewhere...

		Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
		field...

		Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
		open field.

		Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
		into the field, looking for just the right spot.

		Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
		half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
		his mouth...

		He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
		face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and 
		still...the air clean and crisp...

		He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
		in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The room is dark...

		Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

		He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
		look in his eyes...

		As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
		eyelids appear to grow heavy...

		He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
		focusing on her...but its no use...

		Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
		sleep...

		CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

		A PHONE RINGING

		Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
		his face ...he stirs...

		THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

		Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one 
		there.

		Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
		his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

		Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not 
		wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

					JACK
				(groggy, dazed)
			Yeah...okay, send her 
			up...

		He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes 
		stay closed for another moment...then...

		His eyes open...

		He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
		old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(sadly)
			Damnit.

		Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.  He gets out of 
		bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
		the room...

    117	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack walks to the door just as...

		The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
		the door, seeing...

		PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
		face.

					PAULA
			Waiting for me by the door, 
			huh?

		Jack looks at her.

					JACK
			Paula...

		Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on 
		underneath is a sexy little teddy.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(momentarily 
				  distracted)
			Thats totally see through...

					PAULA
				(smiling)
			Merry Christmas...

					JACK
				(confused)
			Christmas?  It cant be 
			Christmas...

		Jack stares at her, totally confused...

					PAULA
				(lasciviously)
			Its whatever you want it 
			to be, Jack...

		Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
		shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
		running down the corridor.

					PAULA (CONTD)			
			Jack?...Jack!

		CUT TO:

    118	EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
		out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

		A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
		Jack stares at him in shock.

					MAN
			Can I help you?

					JACK
			Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
			here?!

					MAN
			Kate? No, theres no one here 
			named Kate.  Is that good 
			enough for you?

		Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
		much to the shock of the guy standing there.

					JACK
			Damn...damn...damn...

					MAN
			Hey, are you okay?

					JACK
			No...Im not...

					MAN
			Is there anything I can do 
			for you?

		Jack shakes his head mournfully.

					MAN (CONTD)
			Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.  
			You got a cigarette?

					JACK
			Im sorry, no...

		Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120	EXT. ARNIES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

		Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
		to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
		of the driveway.

					ARNIE
				(shouting at Jack)
			Hey, you cant park that 
			thing here.

					JACK
				(out the window)
			Its me, Jack...

					ARNIE
			I dont care if youre Tim 
			Allen with your fancy car 
			and all your tools, you 
			still cant park here.

					JACK
			Tell me you recognize me, 
			Arnie.  Please...

					ARNIE
			Howd you know my name?

					JACK
			We bowl together. Were 
			bowlers ...we won a 
			championship...were winners.

					ARNIE
			I never won anything in 
			bowling.

		Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wait a second...
				(thinking)
			Jack...Jack...

					JACK
			Yes...Jack Campbell...

					ARNIE
			Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
			went to high school with
			you...you played baseball, 
			right?
				(at the Ferrari)
			Youre doing well...

					JACK
				(remembering)
			Yes, thats it...yes, we 
			went to high school together.

					ARNIE
			You never really talked to 
			me.  I wanted to talk to 
			you, man...

					JACK
			Yeah...I guess I just 
			wanted you to know, we 
			couldve been really good 
			friends...

    120A	INT. FERRARI - DAY

		Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

		A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since 
		hes heard that sound.

					JACK
				(answering phone) 
			Hello?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			Hey Santa, where are you?  
			Everybodys here.

					JACK
			Adelle?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			You were supposed to be here 
			half an hour ago...the 
			emergency strategy session?  
			Your trip to Aspen? Theyre 
			all panicked here...

		Silence from Jack...

					ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
			Jack...? Are you going through 
			the tunnel?

		Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

					JACK
			Ill be there in twenty 
			minutes...

		CUT TO:

    121	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

		Its a beehive of activity...

		Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
		charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

		Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
		a moment to observe the action...

		Mintz spots him...

					ALAN
				(into phone)
			Thank god, Jacks here. Ill 
			call you right back...

		He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
		Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

					ALAN (CONTD)
				(approaching)
			Jack, are you okay?

					JACK
				(in a daze)
			Whats going on here?

					ALAN
			Its not good.  Bob Thomas 
			has secretly been talking to 
			a European drug company.  
			Were not sure which one, 
			Julias on it right now.  
			Word is theyre willing to 
			let him buy a minority stake 
			and keep running the entire 
			company.  The Global people 
			are up in arms.  They say 
			we shouldve been prepared 
			for this.  Were in trouble 
			here, Jack...

		Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

					JACK
			You know something, Alan.  
			Theres a much more assertive 
			person somewhere inside of 
			you...

		Alan looks at him, confused.

					ALAN
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			But I think I like you better 
			this way...

					ALAN
			Is this another one of those 
			Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

		A sad laugh from Jack.

					JACK
			No.

					ALAN
			So what are we gonna do, 
			Jack?

		Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack...?		 

		Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
		the group...

					JACK
			Ill tell you exactly what 
			were going to do.  Youre
			going to do whatever you 
			have to do to find out which 
			European company hes been 
			talking to.  Then Im going 
			to clean myself up, fly to 
			Aspen, and drink egg nog 
			with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
			and kids will be playing in 
			the background while I spend 
			Christmas day convincing him 
			that the European company is 
			the devil and Global is the 
			answer to his prayers, after 
			all...
				(growing wistful)
			Then Im going to spend four 
			hours skiing. Alone. On 
			Christmas day. Completely 
			and utterly alone. Im going 
			to do that because that is 
			my life, that is whats 
			real, and there is nothing 
			I can do to change that...

		Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
		team.

    122	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

		Jacks limo makes its way downtown.

    123	INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

		Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
		the window, watching the buildings pass by...

		He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
		up...

					JACK
				(dialing 411)
			For Manhattan...Kate 
			Reynolds...I need an address 
			too...

		Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
		hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
		window, then turns to the driver...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Make a right here...

					DRIVER
			But the airports the other
			way...

					JACK
			Were not going to the 
			airport...

		CUT TO:

		123A	EXT. KATES BUILDING - DAY

		Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
		Mews...

		Jack gets out...

    124	INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

		Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
		Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.

		He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
		lower...

		Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
		exchanges a curious look with her.

					LORI
			Are you from the shipping 
			company?

					JACK
			Im Jack Campbell...Im an 
			old... friend of Kates.  
			I just called.

		The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

					LORI (O.S.)
			Kate! Some guys here!

		Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

					KATE (O.S)
				(to Lori)
			Did you call the airline 
			like I asked?!

		Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
		and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
		same.

					JACK
			Kate...

					KATE
			Jack...God, its been so 
			long...You look...

		She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

					JACK
			You look great.

					KATE
			Its good to see you...

		She looks at him another moment, then turns...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(yelling inside)
			Lori! Wheres that box?!

		Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

		125	INT. KATES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
		sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
		SHATTERING it...

					JACK
				(bending down)
			I'm sorry...

					KATE
			Dont worry about it, Jack...

		Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the 
		phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
		up...

					JACK
			Whats going on?

					KATE
				(searching around)
			Im moving to Paris...it was 
			right here...
				(to Lori)
			Its a box marked Jack.  I 
			put it in the stack for the 
			Salvation Army...

					JACK
			Paris?

					LORI
				(to Kate, with 
				 attitude)
			Do you want me to look for 
			the box or call the airline?

					KATE
			Hey, kind of under a little 
			pressure here.

					LORI
			Hey, kind of giving up 
			Christmas day for my ex-boss 
			here.

		Jack watches this back and forth.

					KATE
			You didnt seem to mind 
			offering to help me on 
			Christmas day when you were 
			unwrapping that Prada bag 
			I gave you.

					LORI
			Maybe its by the wardrobe 
			boxes...

		Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

					JACK
			Youre moving...

					KATE
			Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
			has an office there and 
			Im going to be heading 
			it up.

					JACK
				(stunned)
			To Paris. Paris, France.

					KATE
				(searching the 
				 boxes)
			Thats the one...

					JACK
			So youre not at a non-
			profit firm?

					KATE
				(a chuckle)
			Not with what they pay me...

					JACK
			Youre not married, are 
			you?

					KATE
			No, Jack, I never got 
			married. You?

					JACK
			Not exactly...
				(looking around)
			Can we just take a minute 
			here?  Maybe get a cup of 
			coffee or something...?

					LORI
				(yelling)
			Ill go for a cup of coffee!

					KATE
			Yes!

		A relieved smile from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it!

					LORI
			Congratulations. The La 
			Guardia flights canceled 
			but I got you out of 
			Kennedy on United at nine.  
			Am I good or what?

		Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
		marked, Jack...

					KATE
			Here you go.  Its just 
			some old things of yours...

		Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

					JACK
			Do you ever think about us, 
			Kate?  About what might 
			have happened...?

		A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees hes not 
		laughing...

					KATE
			Youre serious...

		A nod from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Ill tell you what, Jack, 
			if youre ever in Paris, 
			look me up. Maybe well 
			go for that cup of coffee.

		One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

		Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
		this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years 
		ago, or left yesterday.

					JACK
			Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

		He leaves...

		CUT TO:

		126	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - EVENING

		A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love, 
		fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his 
		side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

		He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
		material, then a Mondale for President button, which 
		Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
		ticket stubs...

		He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
		button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
		finding...

		A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one 
		Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

		Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
		then...

		He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.

		CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  ONE LAST TRY

		CUT TO:

	127	EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

		Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 
		MPH...

		He looks at the clock, it reads, 8:46. He opens up 
		the throttle...

	128	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

		Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal 
		then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
		sees him...

					AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
			Hey, you cant leave that 
			there!

		Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

	129	INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

		Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris - 
		Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

	130	INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

		...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
		Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
		front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
		attendant.

		He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
		annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

					JACK
				(calling out)
			Kate!

		Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
		face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant go!

					KATE
			Jesus, Jack...

					JACK
			Dont get on that plane!

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Please. Lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee. Thats all 
			Im asking for. Im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			Paris tonight.

					KATE
			What do you want from me? 
			You want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay?

		Jack just stands there, unsure...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Well it is. Yes, I was 
			heartbroken ...But I got 
			over it. I moved on. 
			People change, Jack. I 
			changed. I dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but I assure 
			you, its over...

		Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
		there...

		He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes 
		right...

		He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
		attendant...

		Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

					JACK
				(at Kate)
			We have a house in Jersey!

		Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

					KATE
			Dont do this, Jack...
			But he continues...

					JACK
			We have two kids, Annie and 
			Josh...

		...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
		interested...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard. Shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind. And when she 
			smiles...

		Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
		tears...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And Josh...he has your eyes. 
			He doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart...
				(lost in the memory)
			...hes always got his eyes 
			open, always watching us...
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new...
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle...

		Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity.

					JACK (CONTD)
			...the house is a mess, but 
			its ours...
				(chuckling)
			...well, after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be...

		Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
		the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And you...youre a non-
			profit lawyer. Thats right, 
			completely non-profit. But 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you...

		Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought 
		about.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And were in love. After 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love...
				(with a chuckle)
			You wont even let me touch 
			you until Ive said it...

		Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now... 
		imagining the picture Jacks painting...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...I sing to you...not all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions...

		Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(off hand, to passenger)
			Excuse me...
				(to Kate)
			We made a lot of sacrifices, 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises, but we stayed 
			together...

		Jacks nearly there...

					JACK (CONTD)
			You see, youre a better 
			person than I am...

		Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and it made me a better 
			person to be around you...

		Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her 
		ears.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Maybe it was all a 
			dream. Maybe I went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			December and imagined it 
			all. But I swear, 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me...

		Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes 
		off him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And if you get on that 
			plane right now, itll 
			disappear forever.

		Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
		world...airport business going on around them...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I know we can both go on 
			with our lives. And wed 
			both be fine. But Ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			together...And I choose 
			us...

		Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
		hand to her arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please, Kate, one cup of 
			coffee. You can always go 
			to Paris. Just please, not 
			tonight...

		She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes, 
		searching for the answer.

					KATE
			Okay, Jack...

		DISSOLVE TO:

	131	INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
		falling outside.

		From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
		a cup of coffee...

		FADE OUT.
CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

	1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

		SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

		A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
		London.

		JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
		Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
		eyes... sitting next to...

		KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
		rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

					KATE
			I got you a few necessities...

		Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats 
		Cradle.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			Your copy was a mess...

		Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes 
		off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Every one of these songs will 
			remind you of me in a slightly 
			different way...

					JACK
			All in one tape?

					KATE
			I also put side two of London 
			Calling on there...

		Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
		lips.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			That was not officially the 
			goodbye kiss. It was just an 
			interim kiss...

		He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
		close, kissing her deeply. Then...

					ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
			This will be the final boarding 
			call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
			London, Heathrow.

		Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
		the gate.

					KATE
			You have your ticket?

		Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
		nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

					JACK
			Im not even gonna say it, 
			Kate. Maybe itll be like 
			I never left...

		Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
		gate.

		Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

		...a  moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She 
		looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
		trying to decide...

					KATE
			Wait.

		Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I have a bad feeling about 
			this.

					JACK
			About the plane? What do you 
			think its gonna crash? Dont 
			say that...

					KATE
				(shaking her head)
			I know weve talked about this a 
			thousand times and we both agree 
			that going to London is the 
			right thing to do. But in my 
			heart... this feels wrong.

		She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
		then back into Jacks eyes.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont  go, Jack...

					JACK
			You mean dont go at all?  
			What about my internship?

					KATE
			Believe me I know what an 
			incredible opportunity this 
			is for you...

					JACK
			For us, Kate.

					KATE
			Right, for us. But...Im
			afraid that if you get on 
			that plane...

					JACK
			What?

		Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant 
		say...

					KATE
				(torn)
			Go. Im sorry, you should just 
			go...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			No, youre right.  What are we 
			doing?

					KATE
			We're being responsible.  Go.
			Get on the plane.

		His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

					KATE (CONT'D)
				(a smile)
			Get the hell outta my sight.
			You bother me.

		A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
		nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
		Jack.

					JACK
				(resolute)
			Okay, I'm going...

		He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
		tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
		disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

					KATE
			I can't seem to let go of
			you...

					JACK
			You hear me complaining about
			that?

		A sober look in Jack's eyes.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			Look, we're at the airport and
			no one ever thinks clearly at
			the airport so we should just
			trust the decision we already
			made.  You've been accepted to
			one of the best law schools in
			the country, I've got this
			internship at Barclay's Bank.
			We have a great plan, honey...

		Kate nods, then, with resolve...

					KATE
			You want to do something
			great, Jack?  Let's flush the
			plan...start our lives right
			now, today...I don't know what
			that life's gonna look like
			but I do know it has both of
			us in it.  And I choose us...

		Jack is jolted by her words.

					KATE (CONT'D)
			The plan doesn't make us
			great, Jack.  What we have
			together, that's what makes us
			great.

		Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
		looks toward the gate, only one person left in
		line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

		Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

					JACK
			I love you, Kate...

		...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(taking her face in
				 his hands)
			...and a year in London's not
			gonna change that.  A hundred
			years couldn't change that...

		Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
		the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
		look back.

		Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
		the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
		willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
		doesn't...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    1A	EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

		The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
		Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
		Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

	2	EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

		We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
		building...

	3	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
		moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
		behind it...

		The place looks like a museum display...everything is
		of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

		A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
		Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

		And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

	4	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

		Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
		mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
		A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
		shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
		where he sees...

		A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
		back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
		curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
		turns to him...

		PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
		mouth...

					PAULA
				(holding up toothbrush)
			   I hope you don't mind.  There
			   were like ten new ones in the
			   cabinet.

		A playful smile from Paula.

					JACK
			   It's not what you think.  I
			   took Mentadent public...

		Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
		black dress hanging neatly over it.

					PAULA
			   Did you really mean what you
			   said about Tuscany?

					JACK
			   Of course I did.

					PAULA
			   Last night was great...

					JACK
			   You are an amazing lover.  You
			   should be giving motivational
			   seminars.

					PAULA
			   Thanks.  You're not bad
			   yourself...

		Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
		stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
		slips the dress on.

					JACK
			   I want to see you again.

					PAULA
			   I'd like that, too.

			JACK
			   Tonight.

		She turns to him.

					PAULA
			   It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

					JACK
			   So we'll get egg nog.

		Paula laughs.

					PAULA
				(putting on her shoes)
			   I have to go to my parents'
			   house out in Jersey.  Would
			   you like to come?

					JACK
			   Jersey?  You know what the
			   traffic's gonna be like?

					PAULA
			   I'm taking the train...

		Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
		dangling on his chest.

					PAULA (CONT'D)
			   Don't you have anywhere to go?

					JACK
			   I've got plenty of places to
			   go.

		He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
		answer...

					PAULA
				(a sexy laugh, then...)
			   Maybe I can try and sneak away
			   some time tomorrow morning...
				(kissing him on 
				 the lips)
			   Okay?

					JACK
				(coy)
			   If it's something you feel
			   strongly about.
 
		Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

					PAULA
			It was nice meeting you, Jack...

		CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - MORNING

		Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
		living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

		...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
		hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
		enveloped in music...

    4B	INT. JACKS BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

		Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
		emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance 
		back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

	5	INT. JACKS BATHROOM - MORNING

		Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring 
		through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
		orchestra...

		Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
		tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
		Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

	6	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MORNING

		...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
		suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
		shirts everywhere.

		Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
		front of a mirror.

	7	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

		Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and 
		carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the 
		Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
		from memory...

		The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
		singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
		coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

					JACK
				(a charming smile)
			   Mrs. Peterson.

					MRS. PETERSON
			   Hello Jack.  You dont 
			   have to stop singing on 
			   my account...

					JACK
			   Its because Im shy, 
			   Betty.  So, when are you 
			   going to leave that old 
			   corpse Mr. Peterson and 
			   run away with me?

					MRS. PETERSON
			   You know you could never 
			   satisfy me the way he 
			   does...

		The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
		ahead.

	8	INT. JACKS BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

		TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
		Peterson...

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Merry Christmas, Mr. 
			   Campbell.

					JACK
			   Howd you do this year, 
			   Tony?

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   About four grand.  And a 
			   bottle of twenty five 
			   year old scotch from Mrs. 
			   Johnson in 9D.  Im 
			   putting it all in 
			   commercial paper like you 
			   said.

					JACK
			   Just until the Deutsche 
			   Mark turns...

		Jack exits the building...

	9   OMITTED

    9A	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...

    10	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

		A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
		glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
		Investment House.

		The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
		into the building...

    10A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
		smile on his way to the elevators...

		CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

		DISSOLVE TO:

    11	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

		The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
		this beautiful conference room.

		SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
		with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
		table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
		look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
		of him.

		Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
		small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
		the table.

		Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
		room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
		screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

					JACK
			   ...if MedTech's shares sink
			   any lower than...
				(casually executing 
				 a keystroke)
			   ...forty three, we're in
			   trouble with the stock
			   valuation.  So for god's sake
			   watch what you say to your
			   institutional customers...

		Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   ...we still have almost a full
			   day of trading before zero
			   hour and I don't want any
			   trouble...
				(distracted by Mintz)
			   ...penny for your thoughts,
			   Alan...

		Alan looks up.

					ALAN
			   Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
			   the kids I'd be home by
			   dinner.  You know, it being
			   Christmas Eve and all.

					JACK
			   Is that tonight?

		A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   You think I like being here on
			   Christmas Eve, Alan?

					ALAN
			   I don't know.  Maybe...

		Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
		chuckle.

					JACK
			   Okay, maybe I do have a touch
			   of tunnel vision this holiday
			   season.  But in two days we're
			   going to announce one of the
			   largest mergers in U.S.
			   corporate history.  Thirty
			   billion dollars...
				(basking in the glory)
			   When this kind of deal turns
			   up you get on and you ride it
			   `till it's over.  You don't
			   ask it for a vacation...

		A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
		energize Jack.

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(to the group)
			   December 26th.  After that
			   there'll be so much money
			   floating around here it'll be
			   like Christmas every day...
				(smiling)
			   December 26th, people.  If
			   you'd like to celebrate that
			   day, you all have my
			   blessing...

		Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
		around the table...

					ALAN
			   You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
			   Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK
			   I don't want you to be sorry,
			   Alan, I want you to be
			   excited.  I want my gift to be
			   the first one you open this
			   year.  You know why?

					ALAN
			   Why Jack?

					JACK
			   Because my gift comes with ten
			   zeroes at the end...

		A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
		smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Good man...

    12	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

		The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
		SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
		messages.

		Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
		ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
		messages.

					ADELLE
			   Only eight thirty?  What's the
			   matter, had some last minute
			   shopping to do?

		Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
		hands him his messages.

					JACK
			   You too?  This holiday's about
			   giving, Adelle.  And I'm
			   giving everything I've got to
			   this deal, so in a way, I'm
			   more Christmassy than
			   anyone...
				(holding out the candy)
			   Lifesaver?

					ADELLE
				(ignoring the candy)
			   You're a ray of sunshine,
			   Jack.

		They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
		President" stenciled on the glass...

    13	INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
		messages, and into Jack's office...

    14	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
		high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
		Stairmaster...

		Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
		down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

					ADELLE
			   Oh, and Oxxford called...

					JACK
			   Ooh, my suits are ready...

		He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
		reels back.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Kate Reynolds...

					ADELLE
			   Her assistant said you could
			   call her at home after eight.

		Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
		ghost.

					JACK
			   Her assistant?

					ADELLE
			   Yeah Jack, her assistant...

					JACK
				(lost in the message)
			   Kate Reynolds was my
			   girlfriend in college.  I
			   almost married her...

					ADELLE
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You?  Married?

					JACK
				(snapping out of it)
			   Almost married.  And almost a
			   junior broker at E.F.
			   Hutton...

					ADELLE
			   Excuse me?

					JACK
			   She didn't want me to go to
			   London.  We're standing at the
			   airport saying goodbye and she
			   asks me to stay.

					ADELLE
			   So you left her?  Just like
			   that?

					JACK
			   God, no.  I thought about it
			   for practically the entire
			   flight...

					ADELLE
			   Stop Jack, I'm getting all
			   weepy.

					JACK
			   I took the road less traveled,
			   Adelle.

					ADELLE
			   And look where it's led you...
				(picking up the phone)
			   I'm gonna get her on the
			   phone...

		Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
		back...

		Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
		reaches out and hangs up the phone.

					JACK
			   No...

					ADELLE
			   No?!  You almost married this
			   woman.  Aren't you even
			   curious what she wants?

					JACK
			   She's probably just having a
			   fit of nostalgia.  You know,
			   lonely Christmas Eve, call the
			   one that got away, that kind
			   of thing.

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   I'm telling you, it's ancient
			   history...

		Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
		chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
		the room.

					LASSITER
			   Eight forty-five on Christmas
			   Eve and Jack Campbell is still
			   at his desk.  There's a
			   Hallmark moment for you...

		Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
		times.

					JACK
			   Peter.  I don't see you
			   rushing home to trim the tree.

					LASSITER
				(pouring himself 
				 a scotch)
			   That's because I'm a heartless
			   bastard who only cares about
			   money.

					JACK
			   And God love you for it.

		Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
		Jack.

					LASSITER
				(sipping the scotch)
			   I just got a call from Terry
			   Haight.  Bob Thomas is
			   nervous...

					JACK
			   That'll happen when you're
			   about to spend thirty billion
			   dollars on some aspirin...

					LASSITER
			   Someone's gonna have to nurse
			   him through this.

					JACK
			   Why are you staring at my
			   breasts, Peter?

					LASSITER
			   I need you, tiger..

					JACK
			   Where is he?

					LASSITER
			   Aspen.

		Jack pauses for a beat.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
			   won't be able to make it
			   tomorrow...

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

					LASSITER
			   You're a credit to capitalism,
			   Jack.

		Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

					JACK
			   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
			   question.  An old girlfriend
			   calls you out of the blue on
			   Christmas Eve...

					LASSITER
			   You suddenly having trouble
			   getting dates?

					JACK
			   Not by a long shot.

					LASSITER
			   Then leave it in the past.
			   Old flames are like old tax
			   returns.  You keep `em in the
			   file cabinet for three years
			   and then you cut `em loose.

		Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
		Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
		Knicks hoop.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   I'll leave from the office
			   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
			   group.  Schedule an emergency
			   strategy session for noon.

					ADELLE
			   That'll be a nice little
			   holiday treat.

    15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		A single light remains on in the building.

    16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

		Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
		checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

		Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
		checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
		to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
		glory, then he see it...

		...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
		trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
		the night...

    17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
		desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
		monitors.

					FRANK
			   Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
			   call down, I would've had Joe
			   get your ride.

		Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
		street.

					JACK
			   I'm thinking I might walk
			   tonight, Frank.

					FRANK
			   Nice night for it.  I'll have
			   Louis send your car home.

		A nod from Jack.

					FRANK (CONT'D)
			   Merry Christmas to you, sir...

					JACK
			   Thanks.  To you too...

		Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
		out into the crisp night air...

    18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

		Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
		large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
		falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
		the windows of the closed shops along the way.

		He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
		Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

		He heads toward it...

    20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
		Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

		SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
		behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
		salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
		liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

		...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
		"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
		coffee machine...

					CASH
			   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
			   a certified winner...paper-
			   thin but good as gold...

		Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

		Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

					JACK
			   Egg nog?

					SAM WONG
				(pointing)
			   Dairy case.  Five dollar.

					CASH
				(in the b.g., to 
				 Sam Wong)
			   Y'all do the lotto here...?
			   `Cause I got me a winner...I
			   know, I know, Lotto keeps the
			   black man down... but not
			   me...

		Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
		handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
		the counter...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   ...06...14...18...48...right
			   there.  Four numbers...that's
			   two hundred and thirty eight
			   dollar...
				(a smile)
			   Merry Christmas and shit...

					SAM WONG
				(barely looking 
				 at ticket)
			   Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
			   with pencil.

					CASH
			   What're you talkin' about?

					SAM WONG
				(throwing the ticket 
				 back)
			   You draw lines with pencil!  I
			   know about this!

		The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
		looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
		bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
		instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
		back...

					CASH
			   What!?  Look at the ticket...!

					SAM WONG
			   Get out, I call 911.

		The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

					CASH
			   You're lookin' at me, you're
			   not even lookin' at the
			   ticket!

		The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
		the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

					SAM WONG
			   You leave now.  Take ticket
			   somewhere else.
				(calling out)
			   Next customer in line...!

					CASH
			   You first generation,
			   xenophobic, money-theistic,
			   hot pastrami sandwich
			   making...

					SAM WONG
				(screaming)
			   Get out!

		Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
		face...

					CASH
			   LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

		A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

					JACK
				(carefully)
			   Let me see that ticket.

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
				(menacing)
			   Was I talkin' to you?!

		Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
		then...

					JACK
			   Maybe I'll buy it from you.

		Now Cash walks over to Jack...

					CASH
			   Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
			   kicked tryin' to be a hero.
			   Film at eleven...
				(then...turning to 
				 the coffee machine)
			   What?!  Oh no, not another
			   lookie-loo.  You know how big
			   a job this is?

		The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
		confused.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You're double bookin' me!
			   You're gonna get double
			   billed!  Shit!

		Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
		SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
		baby...

					JACK
			   Hey, c'mon...

		In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
		pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
		covers her baby.

					CASH
				(in Jack's face)
			   Do you want to die?

		Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
		cool...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

					JACK
			   No.
 
					CASH
				(a smile)
			   Yes you do...

					JACK
			   Look, I'm talking about a
			   business deal here.  I buy the
			   ticket for two hundred, take
			   it to a store where the guy
			   behind the counter...
				(glaring at Sam Wong)
			   ...doesn't have a death wish
				(back to Cash)
			   ...I just made myself a quick
			   thirty eight dollars.

		Cash gets closer...

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Like I said, it's a business
			   deal...

					CASH
			   Damn, you are the real
			   thing...

		Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
		gun back into his pants...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
			   here...
				(to Sam Wong)
			   You were lookin' at me, papa,
			   you shoulda been lookin' at
			   the ticket.  That ticket was
			   legit, B.  You're fake...

		Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
		his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
		hundred dollars...

					JACK
			   How'd you know my name was
			   Jack?

					CASH
			   I call all you white guys
			   "Jack."

		Jack nods...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You know you seem pretty
			   relaxed for a guy who just had
			   a gun pulled on him.

					JACK
			   There's no way I was gonna die
			   in that deli...
				(off Cash's look)
			   Let's just say I've been on a
			   lucky streak lately.

					CASH
				(a big LAUGH)
			   A lucky streak, huh?

		Jack hands him the money.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Sound pretty sure of yourself,
			   don't you?

		Jack nods.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   So you're telling me, you've
			   got a gun to your head and you
			   don't think for one second,
			   what if this, what if that,
			   maybe I shouldn't do this, I
			   shoulda done that.

					JACK
			   I don't do that.  That's just
			   not for me...

		Cash looks at him, then smiles.

					CASH
			   Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
			   business with you...
			   Cash is about to take off...

					JACK
			   Hey...

		Cash turns around.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   What do you want to carry that
			   gun around for, anyway?
			   You're just gonna do something
			   you'll regret...

					CASH
			   You want to talk about
			   regrets, you're talking to the
			   wrong person.

		Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
		the carton...

					JACK
			   I'm just saying that you seem
			   like a smart guy.  At a
			   certain point you're gonna do
			   something, and then there's no
			   turning back...

					CASH
			   Yeah, in most cases that'd be
			   true.

		Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

					JACK
			   I mean there must be programs
			   out there, opportunities...

					CASH
				(a deep laugh)
			   Wait a minute, wait a
			   minute... you're tryin' to
			   save me?

		A look from Jack...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Oh man, you're serious...
				(out to the street)
			   This man thinks I need to be
			   saved!

					JACK
			   Everyone needs something.

		Cash looks at Jack...

					CASH
			   Yeah?  What do you need?

					JACK
			   Me?

					CASH
			   You just said everyone needs
			   something.

					JACK
			   I've got everything I need.

					CASH
			   Wow.  It must be great being
			   you.  You got it all.

		Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

					JACK
			   Look, I'm not saying you'd be
			   able to do it without some
			   hard work...

					CASH
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You still think this is about
			   me, don't you?

					JACK
			   Sure it's about you.  But it's
			   about society, too.

					CASH
			   Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
			   one... Just remember, Jack,
			   you did this.  You brought
			   this on yourself...

		And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
		street with his egg nog...

    22	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
		off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
		heads into the bedroom.

		Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

		CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    24	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he 
		opens his eyes...feels something strange...

		Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his 
		chest.

		A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
		remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

		He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

		...did she have a dog?

		He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

		...KATE REYNOLDS...

		...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

		His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived 
		in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
		the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window.

		He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
		on the night stand, but its not there.  Its a Timex 
		Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...

		Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its 
		a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

					KATE
			   Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
			   Jack... its Christmas...

		Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

		Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
		ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
		of her lungs...

					ANNIE
			   Jingle bells, Santa s
			   mells, Rudolph laid an 
			   egg...la la la, la-la la 
			   la, la la la la la...

		Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
		herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   You too, Luce...

		The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
		everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
		starts jumping.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   Rise...and...shine...!

					KATE
				(stirring)
			   Youre jumping, 
			   sweetheart...

		Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
		funeral.

					ANNIE
			   Mom, dont you think we 
			   need to open the 
			   presents?

					KATE
				(groggy)
			   Mommy needs five more 
			   minutes in la la land.  
			   That could be her 
			   present...

		Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing 
		on.

					ANNIE
			   Cmon, Dad.  Get up!

		She said Dad.

		Thats it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
		gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it.

		He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

		Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
		for the first time...hes naked...

		...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
		the bed...

		...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
		cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

		Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

					KATE
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
		near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
		eyes...

		Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her 
		scream...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(still groggy)
			   Strong coffee, okay?

		She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

		A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
		of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
		gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
		fireplace.

		Jack darts to the top of the steps...

					KATE (O.S.)
				(calling from 
				 the bedroom)
			   Use an entire can if you 
			   have to!

		He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
		stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
		in shock.

		He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
		door...about to step out when he looks down and 
		realizes...

		...hes barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
		boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
		leave when...

		He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
		lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
		do...

		The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
		wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
		60s), Kates parents.  Big Eds wearing a ten gallon 
		hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
		dangling from her mouth.

					JACK
				(drawing on a 
				 memory)
			   Ed?  Lorraine?

		Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
		gifts.

					BIG ED
			   Jack you ol bird dog.  
			   Merry Christmas to ya...

		Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.

					LORRAINE
			   Talk to him, Jack.  
			   Please.  One day a year 
			   away from the Ponderosa.  
			   I dont think thats too 
			   much to ask.

					BIG ED
			   I heard that.  This is 
			   who I am, woman!
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Tell her, Jack!  Youre 
			   the only one who gets me, 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

					LORRAINE
			   I need some egg nog...

					BIG ED
			   Course you do.  Hell, 
			   its almost 8 a.m.  
				(shouting upstairs)
			   Where are my two lil 
			   pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
			   Giddy up, Bid Eds here!

					JACK
			   Excuse me.

		Jack dashes out the door.

					LORRAINE
			   Where are you going, 
			   Jack?
				(to Big Ed)
			   Wheres he going?

					BIG ED
			   Damned if I know...

		They start to remove their coats, when...

		The door flies back open...

					JACK
			   Wheres my car?!  Wheres 
			   my Ferrari!?

					BIG ED
			   What the hell are you 
			   talking about?
				(to Lorraine)
			   Whats he talking about?

					JACK
			   Look, can I just borrow 
			   your car?!  I promise 
			   itll be returned!

					BIG ED
			   The Caddy?  Why dont you 
			   take your own damn car!

					LORRAINE
			   Oh just let him borrow 
			   your precious Cadillac, 
			   for gods sake.

		Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

					BIG ED
			   Hes got a perfectly good 
			   mini-van sitting out 
			   there in the driveway!

		Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
		house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
		in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

		He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
		driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the 
		rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
		of the driveway...

    27	INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...

    28	INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

		Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
		passes under a sign for Manhattan.

    29	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

		The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.  
		Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
		running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
		sternly in front.

					JACK
			   Tony, thank god...

		Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
			   for residents and guests 
			   only...

					JACK
			   What are you talking 
			   about?  Its me, Jack 
			   Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
			   I put you into commercial 
			   paper!

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(not moving)
			   Uh-huh...

		Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
		her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

					JACK
			   Elizabeth Peterson!

		The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(to Tony re: 
				 Jack, annoyed)
			   Who is this man?

		Tony shrugs his shoulders.

					JACK
			   You know me, Betty.  You 
			   do.  Jack Campbell.  
			   Were on the co-op board 
			   together.  We fought side 
			   by side for garbage 
			   disposals.  Every morning 
			   we exchange quasi-sexual 
			   witty banter.  Think...

		She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
		YAPPING.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(to Mrs. Peterson)
			   Should I call the cops?  
			   Im gonna call the 
			   cops...

		Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(raising a hand 
				 to Tony)
			   No...

					JACK
				(a sigh of relief)
			   Thank you, Betty.  I know 
			   if I can just sleep this 
			   off, Ill be fine...

					MRS. PETERSON			
			   And sleep you shall.  
			   Noblesse oblige is not 
			   dead.  Not yet 
			   anyway...Come, lets get 
			   you some help.  Surely 
			   there must be a shelter 
			   somewhere in this city.

					JACK
			   A shelter?!  Im the 
			   richest guy in the 
			   building...Ive got twice 
			   the square footage you 
			   have!

		Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
		her face.

		Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

		CUT TO:

    30	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

		Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
		van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
		building entrance...

    31	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

		Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
		desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

		Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

					FRANK
			   Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
			   it right there...

					JACK
			   Frank.  Wheres Alan 
			   Mintz?  Is he here yet?

					FRANK
			   Mr. Mintz?
				(a knowing chuckle)
			   I dont think 
			   so...buildings closed 
			   pal.  Youll have to come 
			   back tomorrow.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont know whats 
			   going on here but I am 
			   Senior Vice President of 
			   this company.

					FRANK
			   I dont care who you 
			   are.  Its Christmas and 
			   like I told you the 
			   building is closed.

					JACK
			   Maybe youre not hearing 
			   me.  I am Jack 
			   Campbell...
				(approaching the 
				 building directory)
			   Right here.  Jack 
			   Campbell, President...

		And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed 
		plain as day on the building director...

		Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
		directory...

		A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
		shock...

		CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?

    32	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

		...its desolate...

		Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
		registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
		toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

		SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks 
		torso...a VOICE from the car...

					VOICE (O.S.)
			   Hey!  Watch where youre 
			   walking!

		Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant 
		quite make out the face...

					VOICE 
			   You almost dented my two 
			   hundred thousand dollar 
			   car!

		Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
		familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   Thats right!  My new 
			   cars worth more than 
			   your shitty house!

		A look of realization on Jacks face...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   I feel like I really did 
			   win the lottery!

		...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...

		Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
		smile from Cash...

					CASH
			   Miss me, Jack?

					JACK
			   Thats my car!  You stole 
			   my car!

					CASH
			   Its a callable asset 
			   seized in accordance with 
			   the acquisition by-laws 
			   of your alt-fate 
			   contract...

					JACK
			   What?!

					CASH
			   Basically, its my car 
			   now.  Get in.

		Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
		hesitates...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont make the 
			   rules, Jack.  This is how 
			   it works.  Get in.

		Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33	INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

		Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
		burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
		back seat...

					CASH
			   Might wanna fasten your 
			   seat belt, Jack...

					JACK
				(recovering)
			   What the hell is 
			   happening to me?!

		Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
		of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
		breathing into the bag.

					CASH
			   This kinda thing makes a 
			   lotta guys throw up.  
			   Seen it happen.  So if 
			   you get the urge, do it 
			   out the window.
				(with a taunting 
				 laugh)
			   I dont want you marring 
			   this exquisite leather 
			   interior...

		Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it, 
		sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
		smiles...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont know what 
			   youre getting so worked 
			   up about, you did 
			   this...you brought this 
			   on yourself.

					JACK
			   Brought what on myself?!  
			   I didnt do anything!

					CASH
			   No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive 
			   got everything I need, I 
			   dont have regrets, 
			   thats just not for me... 
			   sound familiar?

					JACK
			   You mean because you 
			   thought I was cocky Im 
			   now on a permanent acid 
			   trip?!!

		Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...

					CASH
			   Everyone else in that 
			   store is a statue, they 
			   see their lives passing 
			   in front of their eyes, 
			   but not you.  Youre 
			   making a business deal...

					JACK
				(enraged)
			   Give me my goddamn life 
			   back!

					CASH
			   You?  What about me?  Im 
			   working hard for you 
			   here, Jack.  On Christmas 
			   too!  Now you did a good 
			   thing last night, 
			   intervening that way.  I 
			   was moved...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			   Please.  Just tell me 
			   whats happening to me.  
			   In plain English.  None 
			   of that mumbo jumbo...

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
			   Its a glimpse, Jacko.

					JACK
			   I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
			   what!?  What glimpse?!  
			   Glimpse!

					CASH
			   Look, eventually, 
			   everybody gets one...some 
			   of em take a couple 
			   seconds...
				(looking at Jack)
			   ...some of em take a lot 
			   longer...

					JACK
			   I asked you a direct 
			   question!  A glimpse of 
			   what?!

		A look from Cash.

					CASH
			   Figure it out.  You got 
			   plenty of time.

					JACK
			   How much time?!

					CASH
			   As long as it takes to 
			   figure it out.  Which, in 
			   your case, could be 
			   considerable.

					JACK
			   Look, I just want my life 
			   back.  Now whats it 
			   gonna take?  You wanna 
			   talk turkey?  Lets talk 
			   turkey!  How much 
			   money...?

		Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
		Jack a smile.

					CASH
			   Do I look like I need 
			   your money.  It doesnt 
			   work like that and I 
			   cant tell you why.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					CASH
			   Because you got to figure 
			   it out for yourself.
				(beat)
			   Are you listening to me?

					JACK
			   Figure it out?  Figure 
			   what out?!

		Cash just stares at him...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats it?  Thats all I 
			   get?!  A glare?!

					CASH
			   Look Jack, in my 
			   experience the best way 
			   people deal with this is 
			   to just relax and breathe 
			   through it...let it come 
			   to you.

		Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont have time 
			   for this right now.  Im 
			   in the middle of a 
			   deal...
					CASH
			   Oh youre working on a 
			   new deal now...did I
			   mention that?

					JACK
			   You know what?  Ive had 
			   it with you.  Ive had it 
			   with all of this shit...

		SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
		sending Jack through the windshield.

		Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
		to the mini-van.

		Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
		Jack...

					CASH
			   Here...

		Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
		BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

					JACK
			   Whats this, a signal?  
			   Will you come whenever I 
			   ring it?

					CASH
			   Do I look like I live in 
			   a bottle?

		Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

					JACK
				(lost)
			   But what do I do?

					CASH
			   Look Jack Im late.  Id 
			   love to help you out some 
			   more but I gotta go 
			   handle my business...
				(gesturing to 
				 the mini-van)
			   Happy trails.

		Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
		to Cash.

					JACK
			   Hey, you did this to me, 
			   you cant just leave me 
			   like this.

		Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

					CASH
			   Fine.  You want to know 
			   everything, Ill tell you 
			   everything.  But not 
			   here.  Lets get some 
			   air...

		Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
		driver side door...

					JACK
				(relieved)
			   Thanks, man...

		Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
		around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
		a blast of horsepower...

		Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
		the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
		disappearing...

		The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
		Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
		and finally to the mini-van.

    34	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

		The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
		the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
		Christmas.

    35	INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

		Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
		steering wheel and the cars registration in his 
		hand...

		He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
		science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
		late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
		fruit in hand...

		Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
		window.

					JACK
			   Excuse me.  Do you know 
			   where Merrison Street is?

		Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

					ARNIE
				(turning to his wife)
			   Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36	INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
		decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his 
		shoulder.

					ARNIE
			   You look terrible...

		Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time 
		fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
		board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Truth is I expected you.  
			   Kate called before and 
			   asked if I knew where you 
			   were.

		Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I know, I moved the 
			   Barca-lounger into the 
			   corner.  Its throwin 
			   everybody off.  What do 
			   you think?

					JACK
				(with a nod)
			   Great room...

		A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means 
		something to him.

					ARNIE
			   You and me, buddy.  We 
			   know how to live...

		Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
		out of a bamboo bottle holder.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   So Jack, you okay?

		Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
		photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
		with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
		Champs, 1994.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I mean you leave the 
			   house on Christmas 
			   morning, you dont tell 
			   anyone where youre 
			   going...

		Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

					JACK
			   Were friends, arent we?

					ARNIE
			   Maybe I dont say it 
			   enough but you moving in 
			   next door to me...

		Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
		nods.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Talk to me...

		A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
		open eyed, ready to listen.

					JACK
			   Im having kind of a bad 
			   day.

					ARNIE
				(nodding)
			   I read somewhere that the 
			   suicide rate doubles 
			   during the holidays...

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(to himself)
			   What am I saying?  You 
			   dont need to hear 
			   that...
				(back to Jack)
			   All I meant was a lot of 
			   people have a hard time 
			   dealing with all the 
			   forced reverie, thats 
			   all.  Is that you?

					JACK
			   Is it...?

					ARNIE
			   Trouble at work?

					JACK
			   I dont think so.

					ARNIE
			   Its not Kate, is it?

		Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnies eyes 
		widen...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(proudly)
			   You see, its like were 
			   in each others heads...

					JACK
			   Kates my wife...

		Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.

					ARNIE
				(a playful smile) 
			   Just keep saying it, 
			   Jack, like a mantra.

		Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
		arm.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Cmon, I better walk ya 
			   home.  Shes mad enough 
			   as it is, right...?

    37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

		Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

					ARNIE
			   Look, you fit the profile 
			   exactly.  Thirties, 
			   house, kids, financial 
			   responsibilities.  You 
			   start thinking...this 
			   isnt the life I dreamt 
			   about.  Wheres the 
			   romance, wheres the joie 
			   de vivre?  Suddenly, 
			   every lingerie ad in the 
			   Newark Star Ledger 
			   represents a life you 
			   cant have...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			   Its just two kids, 
			   right?

		A chuckle from Arnie.

					ARNIE
			   You made a choice, Jack, 
			   a promise to your wife. 
			   Maybe sometimes it seems 
			   like you gave up the 
			   world, but look what you 
			   got...

		They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
		cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
		lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
		built...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Four bedrooms, two and a 
			   half baths, and a 
			   partially finished 
			   basement...

		Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(shaking his head)
			   Kids...

		Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Okay look, you probably 
			   dont want to hear this 
			   right now but remember
			   what you told me last 
			   summer when I almost had 
			   that thing with Arnie 
			   Jr.s speech therapist.

		A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
		glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
		shoulders and looking him in the eye.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Dont screw up the best 
			   thing in your life just 
			   because youre a little 
			   unsure about who you 
			   are.  Okay?

		Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   God, it feels so good to 
			   finally give something 
			   back to you...

		Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Im gonna hug you now...

		Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
		push toward the door...

    38	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

		Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
		Arnies gone.

		Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Hold on a second...

		She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, shes 
		dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

					JACK
			   You cut your hair...

		A curious look from Kate.

					KATE
			   Ten years ago...

		Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
		nothing.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Are you okay?

					JACK
			   Yeah...fine.

		She gives him a resolute nod, then...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Never mind, he just 
			   walked in...

		Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
		stares him down angrily.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Do you have any idea what 
			   you put us through 
			   today?!  You walk out of 
			   here at 7:30 in the 
			   morning, dont tell me 
			   where youre going, or 
			   even that youre going, 
			   and I dont see you til 
			   hours later.  I had state 
			   troopers looking for 
			   you!  I called 
			   hospitals...
				(pointing at 
				 the phone)
			   ...I was just on the 
			   phone with the morgue 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
		building.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man leaves 
			   his family on Christmas 
			   morning without a word 
			   about where hes going?

		Jacks almost to a breaking po	INT.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man does 
			   that!?

					JACK
				(jumping in)
			   I dont know!  Please 
			   stop yelling at me!

		She looks at him curiously.

					KATE
			   Where were you?

					JACK
			   I was in the city.

					KATE
			   The city?  New York 
			   City?  Why?

					JACK
			   Because thats where I 
			   live.

					KATE
			   Jack...dont even 
			   start...

					JACK
			   Look, you dont 
			   understand.  I woke up 
			   here...and this is very 
			   strange ...this is not my 
			   house...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
		room...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(pointing upstairs)
			   Im not Dad....  Kate, 
			   youre not my wife...

		Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

					KATE
			   You know what, Jack?  
			   Its not funny this 
			   time.  Im really angry.

		She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
		no answer.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(loudly)
			   Jack!

		Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
		gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
		RINGING it furiously.

		Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

					ANNIE
				(re: bell)
			   Whats that?

		Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
		and takes the bicycle bell...

					ANNIE (CONTD)
				(examining the bell)
			   I like this...
				(jumping up and 
				 giving hima peck 
				 on the cheek)
			   ...thanks, Dad!

		Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

		Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

					KATE
			   You missed the whole 
			   thing, Jack.  The 
			   pancakes, the 
			   presents...you spent six 
			   hours putting that bike 
			   together and you didnt 
			   even get to see the look 
			   on Annies face when she 
			   opened it...

		Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You missed Christmas, 
			   Jack.

		Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
		to the moment...

					JACK
			   Im...Im sorry.

		Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

					KATE
			   Look, we dont have time 
			   for this right now, well 
			   talk about it later.  Now 
			   get dressed...
				(pointing to his 
				 outfit)
			   Youre not wearing that 
			   to the Thompsons party.  
			   I dont care how 
			   hilarious you think it 
			   is...

					JACK
			   Party?  Oh no, I cant go 
			   to a party...

					KATE
			   You look forward to this 
			   party all year.  Whats 
			   with you today?

					JACK
			   Trust me on this Kate.  I 
			   really dont think going 
			   to a party is the right 
			   move for me at the 
			   present time.

		Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

					KATE
			   Fine.  Do whatever you 
			   want.

		She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

					JACK
			   What are you doing?

					KATE
			   Telling my mother she 
			   doesnt have to stay with 
			   the kids.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					KATE
			   Because youll be here.

		Kate just looks at him.

					JACK
			   Ill be ready in ten 
			   minutes.

		He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
		watching him...

		He opens the door...its a closet.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Christ...
				(turning around)
			   Where the hell is the 
			   bathroom?

					KATE
			   Funny, Jack.  Im 
			   laughing on the inside.

    39	INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

		The light comes on...

		Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
		collect himself...but somethings not right...

		He glances around...the bathroom is small and its 
		cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...

		...none of this stuff is his...

		...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
		forlorn sense of displacement...

		...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
		anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

		After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
		face...

    40	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
		slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
		shoes...

		He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
		sport coats.

					JACK
			   This is just...
				(searching for 
				 the words)
			   ...this is sub-par...

		Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
		closet.

		He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
		exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

		Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
		pair of the slacks...

    41	EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
		the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
		decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
		decorations this side of Pasaic.

		Kate RINGS the doorbell...

		EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too 
		tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

					EVELYN
			   Kate!  Jack!
				(turning around, 
				 to guests)
			   Everybody, Jack and Kate 
			   are here!

		Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
		GUESTS.

		A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
		condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks 
		arm...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Like the dress...?

					JACK
				(glancing at it)
				 Its lovely...

					EVELYN
				(a satisfied smile)
			   I thought I saw you 
			   notice it at the kids 
			   recital.

		Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
		to catch up with Kate...

    42	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

		The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
		b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

		Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater 
		than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The 
		Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
		new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
		imported from Europe, but everyones having a good 
		time...

		...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
		THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
		walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...

					NICK
			   Did you see Van Horn last 
			   night?  This kids gonna 
			   single-handedly save 
			   basketball in the state 
			   of New Jersey...

					JACK
			   The Nets?  Youre kidding, 
			   right...?

		Nick looks at him in disbelief.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			   Well...theyre certainly 
			   due.

		BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
		plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.

					BILL KRAMER
			   So tomorrows the big 
			   day, Jackie...

					JACK
			   Okay...why?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Triple bypass.  Im going 
			   under the knife.  I told 
			   you, didnt I?

					JACK
			   Triple bypass?
				(pointing to his 
				 plate)
			   You really think you 
			   should be eating all 
			   that?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Why not?  I figure Im 
			   going in for a cleaning 
			   tomorrow, I might as well 
			   load up on the fried 
			   stuff tonight...

					ARNIE
			   Good thinking, Bill.  
			   Have another drink.
				(whispering to Jack)
			   Hell be lucky if he 
			   lives through the 
			   night...

		Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
		Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
		politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

		Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
		first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
		puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an 
		effort...

		Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
		hand...

					EVELYN
				(holding out a 
				 puff to Jack)
			   Finger food...?

					JACK
			   I dont think so, thank 
			   you...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Cmon, as soon as I put 
			   them down, youre gonna 
			   grab a couple...you 
			   always do...

		Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
		other side of the room...Kate watches as...

		Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly 
		putting it near his lips...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Let me.  Theyll melt in 
			   your mouth...

		He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
		treat inside...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Good?

		On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial 
		expression, this would be it...

					JACK
				(forcing a smile) 
			   Theyre great!  Thank 
			   you!

		...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
		Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

					EVELYN
			   Mushroom puffs arent the 
			   only thing I do well...

					JACK
			   Well do whatever it is 
			   you do well, and 
			   just...just do it.  
			   Excuse me...

		Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

		Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
		stairs...

    43	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

		Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
		guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
		telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

					JACK
				(loudly, into phone)
			   ...what do you mean he 
			   wont come to the phone?!
				(standing, indignant)
			   Do you realize how much 
			   money Ive made for that 
			   sonuvabitch in the last 
			   eight years?!

		Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Damnit!

		He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

					KATE (O.S.)
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
		him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
		her face.

					KATE
			   Are you sure youre 
			   okay...?

		A forced smile from Jack.

					JACK
			   Yes, Im fine.  Its just 
			   this god awful football 
			   phone!  Who has a phone 
			   like this anyway?!

					KATE
				(doubtful)  
			   Uh huh...

		Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You must really love 
			   Evelyns mushroom puffs, 
			   huh?
				(with a wink)
			   You know theyre not 
			   real...

		She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
		He looks across the room and sees...

		Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
		jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

		Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
		slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

		He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

					KATE
				(to guests)
			   ...then she asks me to 
			   put this sweater on.  
			   What choice do I have, 
			   right?

		Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   But as Im slipping it on 
			   I notice shes misspelled 
			   the word lawyers.
				(laughing)
			   I had to go through the 
			   entire day wearing a hand 
			   embroidered sweater that 
			   said, Non-Profit Layers 
			   Do It For Free.

		The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
		laughing, until...

					JACK
				(to Kate, off-hand)
			   So youre a lawyer...?

		A chuckle from the group.  Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   A non-profit lawyer...

		People are starting to LAUGH.

					KATE
				(a little embarrassed)
			   Jack...

					JACK
			   Pro bono.  You dont get 
			   paid at all.  Nobody 
			   makes a dime.  Well, 
			   bravo...

		Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

		CUT TO:

    45	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

		Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
		them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
		face.

					KATE
			   I better go wake my
			   mother...

		Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Here you go...

					JACK
			   Youre kidding me...

					KATE
			   Shes your dog, Jack.

					JACK
			   No, shes not.

					KATE
			   Fine, shes the kids 
			   dog.  Lets go wake Josh, 
			   see if he wants to walk 
			   her.

					JACK
			   But its twenty degrees 
			   outside...

					KATE
				(sympathetic)
			   Youre having a bad day, 
			   Ill go with 
			   you...actually, theres 
			   no way in hell youre 
			   gettin me back out 
			   there...

		Jack looks at the dogs face.  Lucy couldnt be more 
		excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
		leash.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(heading up the 
				 stairs)
			   Make sure you reward her 
			   verbally when she does a 
			   number two...

		CUT TO:

    46	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		The sound of CRICKETS.

		Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
		street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
		winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
		of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.

					JACK
			   Figure it out...Im s
			   crewed...dont have to 
			   be a genius to figure 
			   that out...

		The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Lucy)
			   Its as good a place as 
			   any...

		But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   ...but obviously not up 
			   to your high standards...
				(to himself)
			   Okay...he said youre 
			   working on a new deal 
			   now...fine, youve done a 
			   thousand deals, whats 
			   the first thing you do?

		Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but 
		Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Triage.  Its your 
			   signature.  You survey 
			   the damage, find out 
			   everything you can, you 
			   probe, leave nothing to 
			   chance.  Im just gonna 
			   have to go detective.  
			   How did you get 
			   Mentadent?  You learned 
			   everything there was to 
			   know about toothpaste and 
			   then you pounced...

		Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats our play here...

		Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   If you could take a dump 
			   some time in this 
			   century, then we could go 
			   home where its warm...

		Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   That is if I can even 
			   remember how to get 
			   home...
				(to Lucy)
			   You remember, dont you 
			   girl?

		But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

		Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
		cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

		He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
		on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
		pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
		resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

		CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
	
    48	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

		Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
		7:14.

		Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them 
		from the window...like the morning light in his 
		Manhattan loft...

		He reaches across the bed...its empty...

		A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
		the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

		The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
		pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in 
		Jersey.

		Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
		hoping itll stop...it doesnt.  Then, he hears the 
		sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

		He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

		The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast 
		of Burden.  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
		the song...

					JACK
			   Hello?

		No answer...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(louder, over music)
			   Hello!

					KATE
				(singing)
			   ...my feet are hurtin...

					JACK
				(yelling)
			   HEY!

		Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
		shower curtain open...

		Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats 
		something hes missed...then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Uh...that babys crying...

					KATE
				(unimpressed)
			   And...?

		...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
		naked body.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont give me that look, 
			   Jack, Tuesdays your day 
			   and you know it.  And try 
			   to get Josh to day care 
			   on time, okay?  He missed 
			   the macaroni painting 
			   last week...

		She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

		CUT TO:

    50	INT. JOSHS ROOM - MORNING

		Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
		as...

		Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
		Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
		plastic keys.

		Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
		the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
		rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
		grabs at Jacks nose.

		He looks over to Annie.  Shes still staring at him 
		like hes a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
		the box of Huggies.

					JACK
			   Pull tape...

		Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
		gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
		the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Holy mother of god!

		Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
		a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
		the dresser.

		Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
		lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You must be kidding...

		Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

					ANNIE
			   Youre not really our 
			   dad, are you?

		Jack turns to her.  Shes looking back at him with 
		complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
		moment.  Then...

					JACK
			   No, Im not.

		A look of curiosity from Annie.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I work on Wall Street, 
			   you know with the big 
			   buildings...?

		No response from Annie...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I live in an apartment 
			   house with a doorman, I 
			   can buy just about 
			   anything I want...

		Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   This isnt my real life.  
			   Its just a glimpse...

					ANNIE
			   Wheres my real dad?

					JACK
			   I dont know...

		A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that 
		shes about to cry.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   But dont worry, he loves 
			   you and Im sure hell be 
			   back very soon...
				(to himself)
			   ...very, very soon...

		Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
		and tugging firmly at his hair.

					ANNIE
			   They did a pretty good 
			   job.

					JACK
			   Who did?

					ANNIE
			   The aliens...In the 
			   mother ship.  You look 
			   just like him.

					JACK
			   Uhh...thanks...slightly 
			   better looking though, 
			   right?

		Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Youre not going to start 
			   crying, are you?  Because 
			   Im not really sure I 
			   could deal with that 
			   right now.

		She thinks about it for a moment.

					ANNIE
			   Do you like kids?

					JACK
			   On a case by case 
			   basis...

					ANNIE
			   You know how to make 
			   chocolate milk?

					JACK
			   I think I could figure it 
			   out.

					ANNIE
			   You promise not to kidnap 
			   me and my brother and 
			   implant stuff in our brains?

					JACK
			   Sure.

		Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

					ANNIE
			   Welcome to earth.

    51	INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

		Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

		Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
		monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre 
		clearly supposed to be in the back.

					ANNIE
			   Stop here...

		Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
		Center.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   This is day care.  Its 
			   where babies go when 
			   their parents are at 
			   work.

					JACK
			   Check...

		He gets out of the van...

    52	EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

		...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
		building, holding the baby away from his body.

		He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
		LADY.  She stares at Joshs outfit...

					JACK
			   Do I get a receipt or 
			   something...?

		The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.

    53	EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

		The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
		suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

					ANNIE
			   I have winter camp until 
			   four, then ballet until 
			   five thirty.

					JACK
			   Five thirty.  Okay.

					ANNIE
			   Try not to be late 
			   because kids dont like 
			   to be the last one picked 
			   up.

					JACK
			   Got it.  Good tip.

					ANNIE
			   Bye...

		CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

		Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(calling out window)
			   Hey!  Annie!

		Annie turns back toward him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Where do I go now?

					ANNIE
			   Big Eds.

					JACK
			   Big Eds?  Big Eds 
			   Tires?
				(suspicious)
			   Why...?

					ANNIE
			   Thats where you work.

		A beat.  Then...

					JACK
			   You mean I sell tires...

		She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats what I do.  Im a 
			   tire salesman...

		CUT TO:

    54	INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he 
		spots something a hundred yards down the road...

					JACK
			   Good Lord...

		...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
		Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

		Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly, 
		taking it all in...

		Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
		store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
		everything from alignments to brake jobs...

		Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
		Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
		with TOMMY the salesman.

					TOMMY
			   Hey Jack, you happen to 
			   know the stock number on 
			   those new Michelin X1's?

					JACK
			   Uh...lemme get back to 
			   you on that one...
				(looking at his 
				 name tag)
			   Tommy...

					HECTOR
				(to Tommy)
			   Thomas, why you bother 
			   Jack about that.  Look it 
			   up yourself...
				(to Jack)
			   Okay Jack, we talk 
			   later...

		Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
		with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

		Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
		behind the counter...

					BIG ED
			   Jack my boy!  You are 
			   looking mighty worse for 
			   the wear...Hey, guess who
			   I played bridge with two 
			   nights ago...?

		Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

					BIG ED (CONTD) 
			   Hell, youll never 
			   guess.  One Sydney 
			   Potter.  Thats Sydney 
			   Potter, Chief Executive 
			   Officer of BuyRite 
			   Transport.  Only the 
			   third largest trucking 
			   company in the state.  I 
			   even let the sonuvabitch 
			   win, which wasnt easy 
			   because the guys been 
			   bashed in the head by 
			   Teamsters so many times 
			   his brains like 
			   porridge.  Anyhoo, hes 
			   looking for a new parts 
			   supplier... we can handle 
			   that kind of volume, 
			   right?

		Jack considers this briefly.

					JACK
			   Im gonna have to get 
			   back to you on that...Ed.

		Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
		at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
		as...

		Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
		by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Do I have a private 
			   office somewhere in the 
			   building?

					KENNY
			   Uh...sure Jack...
				(nervously pointing)
			   Right back there...

					JACK
			   Thank you.

		Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57	INT. JACKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
		bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
		littered with tire inventory and price lists...

		Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

		He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
		the room and sits down behind it...

		On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
		plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
		and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
		Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...

		He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
		drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
		inside...

		He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
		back...

		Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine 
		and gives it a good look...

					JACK
			   Bowlers do it in an 
			   alley?...Non profit 
			   lawyers do it for free... 
			   what is it with these 
			   people?  Dont they 
			   realize this refers to 
			   sex?

		He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
		where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
		out...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   At least you splurged on 
			   some decent scotch...

		He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
		drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
		cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball 
		hoop/garbage can near the door.

		He misses...

		He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
		family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
		the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them, 
		Jack is smiling...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in 
				 the photo)
			   What are you smiling 
			   about...?

		He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
		behind him.  It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
		Junior Sales Associate, 1988.  Jack raises an 
		eyebrow...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Number one...not bad.

		He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
		carefully...

					JACK (CONTD)

			   1988...?  I was in London 
			   in 1988...

		Jacks jarred into reality...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in the photo)
			   You never went to London...
				(picking up the photo)
			   ...you never got on that 
			   plane...

		He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

		The P.A. system comes to life...

					ESTELLE
				(over P.A.)
			   Jack to mag 
			   wheels...Jack, youre 
			   needed in mag wheels, 
			   customer waiting!

		CUT TO:

    58	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

		Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.

					JACK
			   ...I was the number one 
			   junior sales associate at 
			   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
			   you know that?

					KENNY
			   No, I didnt...thats 
			   great.

					JACK
			   Thats the kind of thing 
			   you can really build 
			   on...

					KENNY
			   Uh huh...

					JACK
			   I mean sales has always 
			   been a feeder for M and 
			   A, always...

		They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales 
		associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
		displays...

					KENNY
			   Here we are, mag wheels...
				(a little concerned)
			   Hey Jack, are you sure 
			   youre okay?

					JACK
			   Well, Im just a little 
			   confused right now about 
			   why I work here...

		Kenny looks at him nervously.

					KENNY
			   Uh...I just started here 
			   last Tuesday.

		Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
		Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
		the customer.

					TOMMY
				(to the customer)
			   So youre all set on the 
			   Skip Shift eliminator and 
			   the Brembo rotors.  
			   Jacks our point man on 
			   alloy wheels...

					JACK
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Do you know why do I work 
			   here...?

					TOMMY
			   Because youre the best 
			   damn tire guy in the 
			   state of New Jersey...
				(proudly, to the 
				 customer)
			   Jack taught me everything 
			   I know about the 
			   business...

		The customer nods, impressed.

					JACK
			   I taught you the business?

		Another nod to the customer.

					TOMMY
			   And hes a crack-up.

					JACK
			   Everything I taught you.  
			   I want to hear it all, 
			   right now.

		Tommys confused.

					CUSTOMER
			   Hey, Im ready to buy 
			   here...

					JACK
				(to the customer)
			   What do you want?

					CUSTOMER
			   I want some alloy wheels.

		Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
		it out to the customer.

					JACK
			   Here.  These are great.  
			   Youll need four.

		The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
		confused...

					CUSTOMER
			   But I dont like these...

					JACK
			   Hey, you heard the guy, 
			   Im the best damn tire 
			   guy in the state of New 
			   Jersey.
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Everything.

					TOMMY
			   Okay...
				(hesitating)
			   Rule number one, the 
			   customer is always 
			   right...

		A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, JACKS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

		Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
		phone...

					JACK
				(into phone)
			   ...I have no idea what 
			   our inventory level is, 
			   thats why Im asking 
			   you...

		A KNOCK at the door...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Look, just send us what 
			   you sent us last month, 
			   okay...?  And keep doing 
			   that until further 
			   notice...

		He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
		his head in...

					BIG ED
			   Got a minute, Jack?

					JACK
			   Ive got all the time in 
			   the world...

		Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
		tough looking man...

					BIG ED
			   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
			   BuyRite Transport, one of 
			   Jerseys top 
			   businessmen...

		Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
		trying to place the name.  Then...

					JACK
			   ...and a helluva bridge 
			   player.  Eds told me a 
			   lot about you...

		They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
		immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

					POTTER
				(in a heavy Jersey 
				 accent)
			   Lucky in cards, lucky in 
			   business, lucky in love.  
			   My cup runneth over...
				(to Big Ed)
			   Hes a nice looking 
			   boy...

					BIG ED
			   My daughters no slouch 
			   either...

		A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

					POTTER
			   Lets cut to the chase, 
			   Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
			   youre the grease that 
			   makes the wheels turn 
			   around here.  I need a 
			   new parts supplier for my 
			   fleet.  You seem to have 
			   the parts.  That we 
			   know.  What we dont know 
			   is why the hell I should 
			   buy them from you.

		Potter stares Jack down.  But Jacks not about to be 
		intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potters 
		stare.  Then...

					JACK
			   I have no idea...

		A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
		Big Ed.

					BIG ED
				(nervous)
			   Cmon Jack...

					JACK
				(to Potter)
			   I mean it.  From what I 
			   can tell, were a mom and 
			   pop operation, were 
			   already over-extended in 
			   sales, and any price 
			   advantage we could offer 
			   would easily be matched 
			   by a larger supplier...

		Jack continues to stare down Potter.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   So like I said, I dont 
			   have any idea why you 
			   should buy your parts 
			   from us...

		The staring match continues.  Big Eds getting more 
		nervous.  Potters the first to blink.

					POTTER
			   Okay, you got my 
			   attention...

					JACK
			   Except for rule number 
			   one...

		Jack smiles.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The customer is always 
			   right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
			   The difference is, we 
			   mean it.  Were small, we 
			   need our customers.  We 
			   cant afford to 
			   disappoint them, ever. 
			   Yeah, you could go to 
			   some leviathan supplier, 
			   probably save a few 
			   pennies on the price of 
			   oil filters, but with us 
			   you get more than a 
			   supplier, you get a 
			   bridge partner...

		A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
		watches, thrilled...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You want to bid hearts, 
			   were right there with 
			   you.  You feel the need 
			   to redouble, youre not 
			   going to get any argument 
			   from us...

		Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The big guys may have the 
			   high cards, but you know 
			   as well as I do, Sydney, 
			   high cards dont always 
			   take the trick.

		Potter pauses a minute, then...

					POTTER
				(to Big Ed, 
				 re: Jack)
			   I like him...

		Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

					BIG ED
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Thats my boy...
				(an arm around Potter)
			   Cmon, lemme show you the 
			   rest of the ranch...

		Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

					BIG ED (CONTD)
				(turning back to Jack)
			   Nice shootin, Jack...

		...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
		face.

    60	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

		Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
		REPORTER at the anchors desk...

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...advancers led 
			   decliners by a nine to 
			   four ratio and the 
			   closing tick was a mildly 
			   bullish plus seventy 
			   six.  Much of the 
			   markets action today was 
			   fueled by the latest 
			   round of merger mania to 
			   hit Wall Street...

		The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
		graphic in the corner of the screen...

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   ...when Global Health 
			   Systems and MedTech 
			   Pharmaceutical announced 
			   their intentions to join 
			   forces in a massive one 
			   hundred and twenty two 
			   billion dollar stock swap 
			   deal.  Though neither 
			   side expressed 
			   significant regulatory 
			   concerns at the 
			   announcement press 
			   conference, it is 
			   believed that both the 
			   FDA and the FTC will be 
			   closely scrutinizing the 
			   marriage, the largest 
			   ever in the health care 
			   industry.  When asked 
			   about possible anti-
			   competitive implications, 
			   Global Chairman Bob 
			   Thomas referred reporters 
			   to P.K. Lassiter and 
			   Company President Alan 
			   Mintz, the original 
			   architect behind the 
			   deal...

		Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
		confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the 
		press conference.

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   Ironically, Mintz first 
			   met Thomas at a Lamaze 
			   class...

					JACK
			   A Lamaze class...!?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...while coaching their 
			   pregnant wives, Mintz and T
			   homas struck up a 
			   dialogue about the need 
			   for consolidation in the 
			   rapidly growing health 
			   care industry and two 
			   months later, the deal 
			   with MedTech was born...

					JACK
			   What?!  Thats my deal?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   In other business news, 
			   U.S. Labor Department 
			   officials announced today
			   that two hundred and 
			   seventy-five thousand new
			   jobs were created last 
			   month, twenty-five 
			   thousand less than 
			   economists were 
			   predicting, leading to a 
			   mild rally in the bond 
			   markets before midday.  
			   But as the trading 
			   session drew to a close, 
			   the profit takers stepped 
			   in and the long bond 
			   closed at ninety seven 
			   even, up only two ticks, 
			   the yield inching down to 
			   six point zero seven 
			   percent...

		Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
		Jacks NYU sweatshirt...

					KATE
			   The kids are asleep...

		She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
		looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Jack.  I said the kids 
			   are asleep...

					JACK
				(distracted)
			   Well thats just 
			   great...those little 
			   monkeys can be a real 
			   handful...

		Kate shuts off the TV.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Hey!  I was watching 
			   that!

					KATE
			   I thought we had a deal 
			   about you watching CNBC 
			   in bed.

					JACK
			   Im working on a new deal 
			   now...

		Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the 
		CD player.

					KATE
			   Fine, but not tonight...

		She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

					JACK
			   Wait a second.  You want 
			   me, dont you?

					KATE
			   That is the general idea, 
			   yes...

		Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little 
		uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
		a little nervous.

					JACK
			   Shouldnt we grab some 
			   dinner first?  Maybe a 
			   bottle of wine...?

					KATE
			   Its ten thirty, Jack.  
			   By eleven youre gonna be 
			   sprawled out on the bed 
			   snoring your head off.  
			   We dont have time for 
			   wining and dining.

					JACK
			   Whatever you say...honey.

		She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
		goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
		hes brought back to a different time and place...

		Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its 
		like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven 
		years...


					JACK (CONTD)
			   God...youre beautiful...

		She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
		compliment...

					KATE
			   Thanks, Jack...

					JACK
			   No, Im serious...youre 
			   really stunning...

					KATE
			   This is good stuff, Jack, 
			   keep it coming...

					JACK
			   I mean back in college, 
			   you were a very pretty 
			   girl, theres no question 
			   about that.  But this...
				(lost in her)
			   ...youve really grown 
			   into a beautiful woman...

		Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
		reacting to the intensity in his stare...

					KATE
			   How can you do that?

					JACK
				(nervous)
			   Do what?

					KATE
			   Look at me like you 
			   havent seen me every day 
			   for the last twelve 
			   years...

		Jack freezes.  Theres love in her eyes but its not 
		meant for him...

		She kisses him...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont move.

		She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

		He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

		He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

		Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
		bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

		At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
		turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

		She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
		light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
		sweetly on the neck...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   night, honey...

		Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he 
		opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
		his face...

		CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT

		DISSOLVE TO:

    61	EXT. MALL - DAY

		Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
		gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
		lot.

    62	INT. MACYS, MENS DEPT. - DAY

		Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies 
		hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging 
		behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
		beleaguered look on his face.

					KATE
				(back to Jack)
			Were almost done here...

					ANNIE
			Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
			promised.

					KATE
			Thats right.  Okay, 
			lets make a quick stop 
			at the kids shoe 
			department, pick up my 
			watch from the battery 
			place, then Ill run into 
			the linen store...

		An unhappy look on Jacks face.

					JACK
			Why dont we just go to 
			all the stores?!

		Kate looks back at Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Every single store in 
			this godforsaken shopping 
			mall.  We can go to them 
			all.

		Kate gives him a look.  Then...

					KATE
			You know what, Jack?!  
			Ill go with the kids.  
			Why dont you just hang 
			out here in the mens 
			department... okay?

		Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
		nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
		it...

		...the Zegna section.  Hes drawn to the neat rows of 
		beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

		He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
		gently touching the soft wool.

					SALESMAN (O.S.)
			Its perfect for your 
			frame...

		Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

					SALESMAN 
			Would you like to try it 
			on?

		CUT TO:

    63	INT. MACYS MENS DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
		perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
		line is dazzling.

		Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
		out... its like hes seeing his old self...

					KATE (O.S.)
			You look amazing in that 
			suit...

		Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
		behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
		away.
					KATE
			I mean...wow...off the 
			charts great.

					JACK
			Its an unbelievable 
			thing.  Wearing this suit 
			actually makes me feel 
			like a better person.
				(taking one final 
				 look)
			Im gonna buy it...

		Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

					KATE
			$2,400?!  Are you out of 
			your mind?

					JACK
				(pointing to Annies 
				 new Mary Janes)
			She got those shoes...

					KATE
			Those shoes were twenty 
			five dollars.  Cmon, 
			take it off.  Well go to 
			the food court and get 
			one of those funnel cakes 
			you like.

		Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.

					JACK
			No.

		Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

					KATE
			No?

					JACK
			Do you have any idea what 
			my life is like?

					KATE
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			I wake up in the morning 
			covered in dog saliva...I 
			drop the kids off, spend 
			eight hours selling tires 
			retail...retail, Kate.

		Kate just stands here, aghast...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I pick up the kids, walk
			the dog, which by the 
			way, carries the added 
			bonus of carting away her
			monstrous crap...I play 
			with the kids, take out 
			the garbage, get six 
			hours of sleep if Im 
			lucky, and then it starts 
			all over again...and why 
			is it that I always have 
			to drive everyone 
			everywhere?  I spend 
			practically my entire day 
			in that slow as hell 
			mini-van listening to 
			Raffi tapes and trying to 
			figure out how the cup 
			holders work...Im sick 
			of it.

					KATE
			Really.

					JACK
			Whats in it for me?  
			Where are my Mary Janes?

		Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

					KATE
			Its sad to hear your 
			life is such a 
			disappointment to you, 
			Jack.

					JACK
			I cant believe its not 
			a disappointment to you!
				(letting it all out)
			Jesus, Kate, I couldve 
			been a thousand times the 
			man I became.  How could 
			you do this to me?  How 
			could you let me give up 
			on my dreams like this?!

		Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

					KATE
			Who are you?

		Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

					JACK
				(lowering his voice)
			Look, Im sorry.  Im 
			sorry I was such a saint 
			before and Im such a 
			prick now.  Maybe Im 
			just not the same guy I 
			was when we got 
			married...

					KATE
			Maybe youre not.  The 
			Jack Campbell I married 
			wouldnt need a $2400 
			suit to make himself feel 
			better about his life, 
			but if thats what its 
			gonna take, then buy it.  
			Just buy the goddamn 
			suit ...we can take the 
			money out of the kids 
			college fund.

		They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

					JACK
			Forget it...
				(taking off the 
				 jacket)
			Well get a funnel cake.  
			Itll be the highlight of 
			my week...

    64	EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

		The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65	INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

		Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
		wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
		on her face...
 
		CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

		Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
		in the back, both asleep...

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Listen, Im sorry about 
			that back in the store.  
			I really dont want to 
			fight with you...

		Kate just keeps looking out the window.

					JACK (CONTD)
			But you must sometimes 
			wonder how we ended up 
			here.  I mean back in 
			college, did you see 
			us...
				(looking around)
			...here...?

		She turns to him.

					KATE
			Ill give you this, life 
			has thrown us a few 
			surprises...

		A glimmer in Jacks eye...

					JACK
			It really has, hasnt 
			it?  So if you had 
			to...what would you say 
			was the biggest surprise?

		She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

					KATE
			Well...Annie for one.

					JACK
			Surprise.  Were 
			pregnant...
				(a laugh)
			Yeah...that mustve 
			been...I mean that was 
			very unexpected.  But 
			what are you gonna do, 
			right?

					KATE
			I think it worked out 
			okay, dont you?

					JACK
			Sure.  I really like 
			Annie.

					KATE
			Good, Jack.  Maybe well 
			keep her.

					JACK
			No, I love Annie.  We had 
			a lot of good times, 
			didnt we?

					KATE
			We were young...
				(a nostalgic smile)
			Remember that little 
			place on Charles Street 
			we used to go to?

					JACK
			Charles Street?  In the 
			Village?  When we were 
			living in Greenwich 
			Village...?
				(off her nod)
			Great times.  Whyd we 
			ever leave?

					KATE
			You cant really raise a 
			kid in an apartment in 
			the Village...

		Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

					KATE (CONTD)
			The trek out to the 
			hospital every day didnt 
			help either...
				(looking at him)
			You were great.  
			Surviving the heart 
			attack was one thing...

					JACK
			You had a heart attack?

					KATE
				(a laugh)
			Jack, stop that. I'm
			still mad at you...
				(a sigh)
			...who knows what 
			wouldve happened if you 
			hadnt stepped in at the 
			store.

					JACK
			Thats why I work for Big 
			Ed?

		A look from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			I mean, thats why I work 
			for Big Ed...

		Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
		together in his mind.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(almost to himself)
			So we had a baby, Big Ed 
			had a heart attack, we b
			ought that house, and 
			Ive been working for him 
			ever since...Sayonara, 
			Wall Street.

		Kate looks at him a little strangely.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(turning to her)
			Our life in a nutshell...

					KATE
			If you want to look at it 
			that way...

					JACK
			How would you look at it?

		She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
		Jack.

					KATE
			A great success story...

		A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
		cant bring himself to share it.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    66	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

		A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

		Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
		nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
		pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
		down the lane...

		Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
		gutter.

					JACK
			Damn...

					ARNIE
				(O.S., from behind)
			Jesus, Jack, this is a 
			league match, for gods 
			sake!

		Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
		scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
		sport.  Jack scowls.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wheres your follow 
			through?  Wheres your 
			stance?

					JACK
			Hey, Im doing the best I 
			can...
				(under his breath)
			Id like to see you hit a 
			squash ball after 
			seventeen beers...

					ARNIE
			Youre right.  Why am I 
			so competitive!?  
			Compensation, I guess.  
			Look, just focus, Jack.  
			You can still pick up the 
			spare...

		Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
		concentrating...

					JACK
				(quietly, to 
				 himself)
			You are Jack Campbell.  
			Youre better than this 
			sport.  You shot the 
			rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
			with the bulls at 
			Pamplona.  You jumped out 
			of a plane over the 
			Mojave Desert, for 
			Christs sake.  You can 
			do this...

		Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
		ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
		can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
		others.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(screaming, excited)
			Yeah!!

		He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
		less...

					ARNIE
				(to TEAMMATE)
			Okay, Pete, youre up.

    67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

		Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the 
		lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
		woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
		bowling ball to a far lane.

					EVELYN
			Hi Jack...

		A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Evelyn, right?

					EVELYN
			Very funny.  I saw you 
			out there on lane five.  
			What do you have the flu 
			or something?

					JACK
			Something like that.

					EVELYN
				(with a wink)
			Need a nurse?

					JACK
			Youre a nurse?

		Evelyn laughs.

					EVELYN
			If thats what you 
			want...

		She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
		follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

					JACK
			Wait a second...

		She turns.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Are we...?

					EVELYN
			Are we what, Jack?

					JACK
			Is there something going 
			on between us?

		Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.  She stands 
		there a beat, then walks back toward him.

					EVELYN
			Are we finally being 
			honest?

					JACK
			It would help me if we 
			were.

					EVELYN
			Okay, youre right, weve 
			been dancing around this 
			for years...

		Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
		face.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			God, my heart is racing.  
			Here goes...
				(a smile)
			When I get dressed for a 
			party and I know youre 
			going to be there... 
			well, lets just say I 
			dont go strapless 
			because my husband likes 
			it...

		An intrigued smile from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			Ive got six sets of snow 
			tires piled up in my 
			garage and I wont even 
			drive in the snow...And 
			our kids just happen to 
			be in the same ballet 
			class every year?

		She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			So, if youre asking me 
			whether Id like it to be 
			more, the answer is 
			yes...

		A look of surprise from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			...and Kate would never 
			have to know.

		Jack considers this for a moment.

					JACK
			Do I have your number?

		A wide smile from Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			Steves out of town with 
			the kids this week.  Why 
			dont you just stop by...

		She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
		sashay back to her lane.

    68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
		over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.

					ARNIE
				(looking at Jack)
			Hey Jack, youre all 
			flush.  I guess that 
			seventy-one took a lot 
			outta you.

					JACK
				(sitting down)
			I just saw Evelyn 
			Thompson.

					ARNIE
			She is relentless.

					JACK
			She wants to have an 
			affair with me.

					ARNIE
			She said that?

					JACK
			Pretty much.

					ARNIE
			Oh yeah...
				(shaking his head)
			What is it about you?

					JACK
				(pushing over a 
				 napkin)
			So could you write down 
			her exact address?

					ARNIE
			Whoa...whoa...wait a 
			second, Jack.  Youre not 
			actually gonna cheat on 
			Kate?

					JACK
			It wouldnt really be 
			cheating...
				(off Arnies 
				 doubtful  look)
			Its complicated.

					ARNIE
			Look, maybe Im not as 
			good a consigliere as you 
			are but you have to trust 
			me on this one.  A little 
			flirtations harmless but 
			youre playing with fire 
			here.  The Fidelity Bank 
			and Trust is a tough 
			creditor.  You make a 
			deposit somewhere else, 
			they close your account 
			forever.

					JACK
			Im telling you, those 
			rules dont apply to me, 
			Arn.

					ARNIE
				(a chuckle)
			Screw the rules.  Im 
			talking about the choice.

		Jack looks at him curiously.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons 
			got no class.  She 
			doesnt marry Dr. Steve, 
			the womans living in a 
			trailer.

					JACK
			Hey, is that really 
			necessary?

					ARNIE
			All Im saying it there 
			isnt a guy in Union 
			County who wouldnt give 
			his left nut to be 
			married to Kate...

		Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Ill see ya later, 
			Jack...

		He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

		CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
		dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
		kitchen where...

		Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
		some legal documents.

					KATE
				(not looking up)
			How was the game, honey?

					JACK
				(opening the fridge)
			Long, boring, and 
			generally pretty sad.  
			Arnie seemed to enjoy 
			it...
				(peering inside)
			Hey, wheres that chocolate 
			cake...?

		Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
		cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
		into her mouth.

					KATE
				(with a smile)
			You mean this chocolate 
			cake?

					JACK
			Thats my piece.  I was 
			saving it because I got 
			nauseated from that store 
			bought chicken.

		Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
		the side of her mouth.

					KATE
			Its good...

		Jack approaches the counter.

					JACK
			Gimme that cake.

		She takes another bite.

					KATE
			No way.

		He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
		where he cant reach it.

					JACK
			Cmon.

					KATE
			Sorry, Jack.  Its too 
			important to me.

		They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

		He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
		chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
		laughing...

		Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
		house... just about the catch up to her when...

		She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
		her...

					JACK
			I want that cake!

		...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
		playfully on top of him...

					KATE
				(laughing)
			You want the cake!?

					JACK
				(out of breath)
			I want it...

		She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
		hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

		Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Thank you...

					KATE
			Its good, right?

		He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
		mouth.

		They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
		each other cake, laughing.

		Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kates 
		face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
		realizes...

		...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Are the kids asleep?

		A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
		passionately right there on the steps...its heating 
		up...

					KATE
				(caught up in the 
				 moment)
			Say it, Jack...

					JACK
			What...?

					KATE
			Cmon, you know what I 
			like to hear...

					JACK
				(in the throes 
				 of passion)
			Yeah, baby, I know what 
			you like to hear...

					KATE
				(kissing him)
			Then say it...just say it 
			to me...!

					JACK
				(swept up in the 
				 moment)
			Oh yeah, youre a bad 
			girl, baby... You make me 
			so hot...Im gonna take 
			you to that special 
			place...

		Kate pulls away.

					KATE
			What...?

		Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
		passion drain from her face...

					JACK
			Not it...?

					KATE
			Nice, Jack.  Youre 
			sweeping me off my feet.

					JACK
			What? You make me hot...

		She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
		the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
		he feels something licking at his hand...

		He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
		wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive 
		gotta go look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
		then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of 
			us can get a little 
			relief tonight...

		He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
		familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

		...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...

		Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
		decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
		curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

		Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
		house...

		He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
		outline of a woman reading by the window...

		EVELYN THOMPSON...

		Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
		nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

		He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
		doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it 
		there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
		reason he cant bring himself to push it...

		He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
		the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

					JACK
				(pulling the leash)
			Cmon, girl, lets go 
			home...

    71	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

		The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
		leash, his face red from the cold outside.

		He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
		coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

		He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
		rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

		CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES

		He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

		He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
		expressions...

		He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
		marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and 
		Joshs 1st Birthday.  He runs his fingers along the 
		tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.  His 
		eyes linger there a moment...

		He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

		ON TV:

		Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers 
		house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
		cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.

		The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

		Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
		music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

					ARNIE (O.S.)
			Jesus, Bill, this thing 
			is an antique.  Dont you 
			even have image 
			stabilization?

		Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

					BILL KRAMER
			Four hundred bucks at Best 
			Buy, Arn.

		Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
		face.

					JACK
			And everyone knows image 
			stabilization is for the 
			weak...

		Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

		Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
		putting an arm around Jack...

					ARNIE
			So Jack, its your wifes 
			birthday, got anything to 
			say to her?

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Its your birthday?  
			Today?  Whats your 
			name?  Where were you 
			born?

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Wait a minute.  Youre my 
			wife?

		She slaps him playfully on the arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I do have one thing I 
			wanna say...

		Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(singing to her)
			Oh those fingers in my 
			hair, that sly come 
			hither stare, strips my 
			conscience bare, its 
			witchcraft... 

		Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but 
		hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
		to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
		guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

		Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and Ive got no 
			defense for it, that heat 
			is too intense for it, 
			what good would common 
			sense for it do...

		Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
		basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he 
		goes along...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Cause its 
			witchcraft, wicked 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...when you rouse 
			the need in me, my heart 
			says yes indeed in me, 
			proceed with what youre 
			leadin me to...

		The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
		crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
		in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the mens faces 
		as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

		A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
		jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
		captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

		Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
		of the gathered guests... 

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch, there aint 
			no nicer witch than 
			you...

		Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But its no 
		longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...

		Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
		watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
		Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
		and walks toward the kitchen...

		Jack raises an eyebrow...

		In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have 
		a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
		verse...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause its witchcraft, 
			that koo koo 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...

		The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
		getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
		unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
		along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him, 
		revering him...

		Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
		underestimated his alter ego...

		On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...when you rouse the 
			need in me, my heart says 
			yes indeed to me, proceed 
			with what youre leadin 
			me to...

		Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch...

		Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
		the crowd.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause theres no nicer 
			witch than you...

		Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...

		Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
		connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

		Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
		completely in the palm of Jacks hand...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
		builds to a crescendo...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
		out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

		Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
		the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

		Back on video...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(speaking quietly 
				 to Kate)
			Happy Birthday 
			sweetheart...I love you.

		Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
		AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
		own little world...

		Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
		fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

		A tear at the corner of his eye...

		The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the 
		video continues...

		Hes left standing there...silent, still...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    72	INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

		Lucy licking Jacks face.  Jack pushes the dog 
		away...as...

		The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

					KATE
				(groggy)
			Time to get up, honey...

		Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
		putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
		practically half-asleep.

    73	INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the kitchen.

		He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
		fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
		heads upstairs.

    74	INT. JOSHS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...into Joshs room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
		in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

		Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
		and then walks out of the room...

		CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
		the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
		smile on her face.

		Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
		behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to 
		Kate.

					KATE
			Happy Anniversary, 
			honey...

		Terror on Jacks face.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(pushing the gift 
				 forward)
			Before you do whatever 
			crazy stunt youve got 
			planned I want you to 
			open mine...

		Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

					JACK
			Maybe I should wait...

					KATE
			No, open it...

		He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
		revealing...

		...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
		suit...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it at an outlet 
			store.  I know its a 
			knock-off, but I think 
			itll look great on 
			you...

					JACK
				(examining the label)
			Zeena...

		Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but 
		this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done 
		for him...

					JACK (CONTD) 
				(tearing up)
			You really are 
			incredible...

					KATE
			Enjoy it, sweetheart...

		Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly 
		remembering how truly screwed he is.

					JACK
			Youre probably expecting 
			something from me...

		Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
		look on her face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Heres the thing.  I 
			really hadnt planned on 
			giving you your...uh... 
			anniversary gift until 
			tonight.
				(an uncomfortable 
				 smile)
			You know, anniversarys 
			good all day...

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about?  You never wait 
			all day.  You can barely 
			wait until its light 
			out.

					JACK
			I know that, but...

		Beat.  Kate looks at him like shes looking into his 
		soul.

					KATE
			You forgot.

		Jack stands there, silent.

					KATE (CONTD)
			You actually forgot our 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Ill fix it.  Ill go out 
			right now and get you 
			something.  Ill make it 
			right.

		That didnt help.

					KATE
				(holding back 
				 the tears)
			Jesus, Jack...Is this 
			where we are now?  Is 
			this our marriage?  
			Suddenly Im the wife who 
			has to drop hints two 
			weeks before her 
			anniversary so her 
			husband doesnt fuck it 
			up?

		Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
		his...

					JACK
			Please dont cry...

		Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

					KATE
				(shaking her head, 
				 crying)
			I dont want to be that, 
			Jack...

		Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
		it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

		Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...

		CUT TO:

    76	INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

		Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
		for some air...

		He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
		pity on his face.

		He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the 
		porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
		handle bar.

		He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
		RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone 
		to appear ...but theres no one.  He RINGS the bell 
		again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
		someones attention.

					JACK
			Cmon...cmon...

		Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
		RINGING the bell with everything hes got...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(shouting to the 
				 sky)
			Cmon, goddamnit, how was 
			I supposed to know the 
			date of their 
			anniversary!?  I never 
			married her!

		Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

					ANNIE
				(slowly)
			Put the bicycle back on 
			the ground...

		Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

		Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
		folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
		the glass to her.

		She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
		milk mustache on her lip.

					ANNIE
			Not bad...I shoulda 
			warned you.  Dad always 
			does something really 
			special for their 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Like what?

					ANNIE
			One year he had a solar 
			system named after her...

					JACK
			Dont you think thats a 
			little gimmicky?

					ANNIE
			Mom liked it.

		Jack raises an eyebrow.

					JACK
			Maybe theres a jewelry 
			store back at the mall.  
			I could get her a pair of 
			earrings or something.

					ANNIE
			Thats good but...you did 
			forget the anniversary.

					JACK
			Right.  Thats a major 
			oversight...
				(thinking aloud)
			So if Im Kate...I cant 
			really afford the finer 
			things, my husbands 
			career is a crushing 
			disappointment to me, 
			Im trapped in suburbia...

		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Did he ever take her to 
			the City?

		Annie smiles, impressed.

					ANNIE
			Youre really gettin the 
			hang of this.

		Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.  
		For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78	INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

		Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
		dressed.

		Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
		carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
		little black one.

		Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

					KATE
			Which do you think?

		Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
		seriously...

					ANNIE
			The black one...

		Kate nods.  Shes about to put it on when she looks at 
		Annie...

					KATE
			Fightings a part of it, 
			Annie.  You know that, 
			right?

					ANNIE
			Im not worried, Mom.  
			Hes still learning our 
			ways...

		Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
		Its true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
		hand to Annie.

					KATE
			Cmere.

		Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
		lipstick...

					ANNIE
				(excited)
			Really?

		Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies 
		lips.

					KATE
			Now go like this...

		Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
		it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her  
		Annies beaming.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Youre gonna break a lot 
			of hearts, you know.

		A smile from Annie...

		Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
		watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80	EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

		A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
		lined lower Manhattan street.

    81	INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

		Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  Its not a 
		Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

		He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
		restaurant...

		He helps her off with her coat.  Kates wearing the 
		sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
		effectiveness...

					JACK
			You look beautiful...

		A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

		Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(instinctively)
			Thanks, Catherine...

		Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
		him a pat on the back...

					KATE
			You okay?

		He takes Kate by the arm...

					JACK
			Fine...

		He leads her to the main room.

		She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
		country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

					KATE
				(quietly to Jack)
			Jack...can we afford all 
			this?

					JACK
			Whats the difference?  
			Im taking my baby out 
			for our anniversary, damn 
			the costs...

					KATE
			How do you even know 
			about this place?

		Jacks caught for a moment.  Then...

					JACK
			Arnie...
				(insistent)
			Arnie.  Hell throw you a 
			curve ball once in a 
			while, thats for sure...

		Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
		cheek...

    82	INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
		standing next to them.  Jacks not even looking at the menu.

					JACK
			Well have the tureen of 
			quail breast with 
			shiitake mushrooms to 
			start, then the veal 
			medallions in raspberry 
			truffle sauce and the sea 
			scallops with pureed 
			artichoke hearts...sea 
			scallops, North of the 
			Caspian...

		Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
		her face.

					WAITER
			Very good, sir.  And may 
			I say those are all 
			excellent selections.

					JACK
			You may...
				(perusing the 
				 wine list)
			Also, well have a bottle 
			of Lafite, 1982.

		Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
		it upside down.

					KATE
			Its five hundred and 
			fifty dollars, Jack!

		A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
		perfect.

					JACK
			Just a glass of red wine 
			for each of us...

		The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

					KATE
			You are so not off the 
			hook yet, slick.

					JACK
			But Im gettin close, right?

		A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
		look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You want to dance?

		A puzzled look from Kate.  Theres nobody else 
		dancing.  There isnt even much room to dance...

					KATE
			I dont think theres 
			dancing here, Jack.

		Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

					JACK
			Sure there is...

		Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

		Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
		arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
		confident and self-assured.

		The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
		in this romantic moment.

		Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
		They look good together...in sync with each other...

		People are watching them...some of the men are 
		impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
		clearly charmed...

					KATE
				(whispering to 
				 Jack)
			Pretty good for a tire 
			salesman from Jersey...

		Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

					JACK
			I have my moments...

		They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

		Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
		Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
		She takes a bite.

					KATE
			Mmmm...
				(spearing a scallop)
			...here, try one of 
			these...

		Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.

					JACK
				(savoring the scallop) 
			God I missed that 
			taste...

		Kate laughs.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Why are you laughing?

		Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
		at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
		fork.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I need to tell you 
			something.

					KATE
			Okay...

					JACK
			I think it may help us 
			but theres a slight 
			chance it could make 
			things worse.

		She hears the seriousness in his voice.

					KATE
			Now Im worried...just 
			say it.  Whatever it is 
			well deal with it.

					JACK
			Are you sure?

		She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I feel like Im living 
			someone elses life...

		Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
		nods reassuringly.  He continues...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I used to be so sure 
			about everything, you 
			know?  I knew exactly who 
			I was and what I wanted.  
			Then one morning I woke 
			up and suddenly it was 
			all different...

					KATE
			Worse, you mean...

					JACK
			No.  Well, maybe a few 
			things.  But mostly just 
			different...

		Jack lets out a small smile.  Now hes the one whos 
		reassuring Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I never used to be like 
			this, Kate.  I had it all 
			figured out.  No doubts, 
			no regrets.

					KATE
			And now...?

					JACK
			Now...I dont...

		He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
		desperate for understanding.

					KATE
			Me neither.

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think its good to be a 
			little unsure about who 
			you are.  Its very 
			human.

					JACK
			But you always seem so 
			certain.

					KATE
			Cmon, Jack, you think 
			there arent mornings 
			when I wake up and wonder 
			what the hell Im doing 
			in New Jersey...

					JACK
			Thats a big one for me, 
			too.

					KATE
			My office is a dump, I 
			answer my own phone...and 
			youve seen my pay check.

					JACK
			Your pay check is a 
			disgrace to pay checks.

					KATE
			I mean yes, I help people 
			that need it...

					JACK
			I guess...some of them 
			are probably faking.

					KATE
				(a laugh, then...)
			God, sometimes I think it 
			would be so nice not to 
			have to stretch ground 
			beef or maybe drive a car 
			with a CD player...

		He smiles, right there with her.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Imagine having a life 
			where everything was 
			easy...where you asked 
			for things and people 
			just brought them to 
			you...

					JACK
			Its wonderful...

		Kate laughs, nodding.

		A pause, then...

					KATE
			I think about it, too, 
			Jack.  I do.  I think 
			about the kind of person 
			Id be if I hadnt 
			married you...

		Its as if shes inside his head.  They stay like this 
		for a moment, looking into each other.

					JACK
			And...?

		She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

					KATE
			And I realize Ive just 
			erased the things in my 
			life Im most sure 
			about.  You, the kids...

		Jack nods.

					JACK
			Good things...

					KATE
			What are you sure about?

		Jack looks into Kates eyes.

					JACK
			Im sure that right now 
			theres nowhere Id 
			rather be than here with 
			you...

		Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  Its been 
		a while.

		CUT TO:

    84	EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

		The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
		the square.  Its like something out of a Henry James 
		novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85	INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

		The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
		enters...

		Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
		furniture...its like walking into another world...

					KATE
			This is so beautiful...

		Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
		silver ice bucket...

					KATE (CONTD)
			You know champagne makes 
			me do crazy things.

					JACK
				(pouring)
			Ill just full yours up 
			to the top.
				(handing her a 
				 glass)
			Happy anniversary, 
			sweetheart.

		Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.

					KATE
			I dont know how you did 
			it, hoss, but you pulled 
			it off.

					JACK
			Im out of the doghouse?

					KATE
			Way out...

		Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
		size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
		her...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to him)
			You may even get lucky 
			tonight...

		Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
		the powerful effect it has on him.

		Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
		in her.

					JACK
			Youre so...beautiful...

					KATE
			I already told you you 
			were gonna get lucky, 
			Jack...

		They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

		Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

					JACK
			My god, all this time...I 
			never stopped loving 
			you...

					KATE
				(a wide smile) 
			Thats all I wanted to 
			hear...

		She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
		caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
		behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    86	INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

		Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

		Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a 
		contented smile on her face...

		Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
		at Kate.

		Theres something different in his eyes...something 
		deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of 
		smile.

		Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.

					KATE
			Mmmm...Jack...

		Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I feel like I should give 
			you money...

		Jack laughs.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I mean, my god, Jack you 
			were always good but 
			this...this was... like a 
			porno movie.

		Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at 
		Washington Square through the window.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I could stay here 
			forever...

					JACK
			I dont think Id fight 
			you on that one...

		Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
		kiss.

    87	EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

		The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to 
		Teaneck.

    88	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

		Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
		practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on 
		MUSIC, but not quite...

		She walks into the kitchen where...

		Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
		Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

		He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
		strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
		goes back to his paper.

    89	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
		sleeve oxford...

   89A	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		The front door of the Campbell House...

		Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
		a bagel in his mouth...

		He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
		slowly behind him...

		In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
		in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
		heads to the car.

		Then...a smile from Kate...

		In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
		into Kates arms...

		...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
		post...

					KATE
			Have a good day...

		A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
		him on his way...

    90	EXT. BIG EDS - AFTERNOON

		Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
		a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
		of high top Nike Air Jordans.

					JACK
			For the money, theyre 
			hands down the best 
			radial we carry...

					MAN
				(thinking, then...)
			Okay, Ill take them...

					JACK
			You wont regret it...
				(shouting to Tommy)
			Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
			with four B.F. Goodrich 
			G-Force T/As...
				(looking the man 
				 over)
			...and give him ten 
			percent off for having 
			the best costume...

		Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
		the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack, Kate on line two!  
			Jack pick up two!

		Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
		back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

		Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

					KENNY
				(walking out to Jack)
			Kates on two, Jack.
				(on seeing the Rolls)
			Nice ride...

					JACK
				(staring at Lassiter)
			If youre into that kind 
			of conspicuous 
			consumption...

					KENNY
			You want me to handle 
			him?  I think Im 
			ready...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack!  Kate still holding 
			on line two...

					JACK
			Sure...be careful, he 
			looks like a tough 
			negotiator...

		Jack walks inside...

    91	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the 
		window, cant take his eyes off him...

		He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
		blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
		Lassiter...

		...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
		phone...

		But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(to Estelle, into 
				 intercom)
			Tell Kate Ill call her 
			back...

		INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

					ESTELLE 
				(into intercom)
			It sounded pretty 
			important.

					JACK
				(into intercom)
			Im with a customer.  
			Ill call her back.

		He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
		outside the store...

		CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

					LASSITER
				(to Kenny)
			I seem to have had some 
			kind of blow out...

		Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK
			Why dont you let me take 
			this one, Kenny?

					KENNY
			Okay, chief.

		Kenny nods then heads back inside...

					JACK
			Peter Lassiter...

					LASSITER
				(surprised)
			Do I know you?

					JACK
			Not exactly. Ive seen you 
			on CNBC.
				(with a smile)
			You look taller in real 
			life...

		CUT TO:

    93	INT. BIG EDS TIRED, JACKS OFFICE - LATE

		Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
		cluttered, cramped office.

					JACK
			...truth is, Mintz was so 
			busy timing his wifes 
			breathing he didnt see 
			that MedTech needed 
			Global more than the 
			other way around.  Ten 
			days, two weeks tops, 
			they wouldve approached 
			you with an offer, and 
			Id bet anything it 
			wouldve been thirty 
			billion, not twenty 
			nine...
				(a knowing smile)
			Problem was, Peter, you 
			had a pussycat running 
			the show. What you needed 
			was a rottweiler.

		Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
		an intrigued look on his face...

					LASSITER
				(nodding)
			Well, Im impressed.

		A smile from Jack.

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			I really am...

		Jack savors the moment, until...

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			So, about my car...

		Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

					JACK
			Sure. Were going to 
			have to special order 
			that tire. Itll be 
			ready in about two days.

		Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
		wallet.

					LASSITER
			This has my office address 
			on it...
				(thinking, then...)
			Why dont you drop it off 
			yourself?

		A smile from Jack.

		Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
		distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
		GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

					HECTOR
			...I say to her, Margarita, 
			we already have four kids, 
			why do we need more?

		Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
		eyes the door...
					
					HECTOR (CONTD)
			But she say she want an 
			even number. I say four 
			is an even number! But 
			she say she want six.

		Jack checks his watch...

					HECTOR (CONTD)
			I tell her, Margarita, I 
			just got my green card, 
			I like to sit back and 
			rest a little bit...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			Hector...do I usually 
			listen to your personal 
			problems?

					HECTOR 
			Sure, Jack, all the time...

		Jack nods, then...

					JACK
			Look, I have some business 
			that I have to take care 
			of in the city so Im 
			leaving early...
				(getting up)
			My advice to you...follow 
			your dreams.

		CUT TO:

    96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

		Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...

		He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
		good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
		skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
		inside...

    96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
		SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes 
		crazy...

    97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Lassiter walk together...

					LASSITER
			...were really more of a 
			boutique operation, as 
			you can see...

					JACK
			But youre not interested 
			in boutique dollars...
				(a smile)
			I get it...

		They walk into...

    98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Past the assistants desk...

					MINTZS ASSISTANT
				(seeing Lassiter)
			Hes expecting you, Mr. 
			Lassiter...

		Lassiter doesnt even slow down...

    99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from 
		the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
		play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
		immediately struck by the difference...

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, this is Jack 
			Campbell...the one I was 
			telling you about...

		Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
		desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.

					ALAN
			Jack, of course.

		They shake hands.

					JACK
				(appropriately 
				 deferential)
			Mr. Mintz.

					ALAN
			Please, call me Alan. We 
			try to cultivate a casual 
			atmosphere around here...

					JACK
				(re: play pen)
			I can see that, Alan.

		A chuckle from Mintz.

					ALAN
			You have kids, Jack?

					JACK
				(hesitating, then...)
			Uh...actually, yes. Two...
			good ones.

		Another laugh from Mintz.

					ALAN
			Thats great...
				(gesturing to 
				 the sofa)
			Why dont you have a seat?

		Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
		Lassiter take the chairs.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			So, Peter mentioned that 
			you were an avid CNBC 
			watcher but didnt say 
			whether you had any 
			actual Wall Street 
			experience?

		Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not 
		realizing he was walking into an interview...

		He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

					JACK
			I was a sales associate, 
			at E.F. Hutton.

					ALAN
			A broker? Really. And now 
			youre in the tire 
			business?

					JACK
			Thats right. And auto 
			supply...

					ALAN
			Uh huh. The retail end, I 
			understand.

		Jack nods...

					JACK
			Uh...we actually get about 
			sixty percent of our 
			business from automotive 
			service.

					ALAN
			Mind if I ask what kind of 
			sales you did last year? 
			Ballpark...

					JACK
			We did one point seven 
			million in total revenue...

					ALAN
			Uh huh...one point seven.  
			And what do you project for 
			this year?

		Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
		questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...


					ALAN (CONTD)
			Any thoughts at all on 
			that?

		As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
		of his handicap...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack?

		He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
		then ...a confident smile.

					JACK
			Well, Alan, I think were 
			gonna have a banner year.  
			Sales are up almost 
			twenty percent in the 
			first quarter and we just 
			landed a major trucking 
			company account.

					ALAN
			Really. So youre 
			projecting what, a tad 
			over two million?

		A gleam in Jacks eye.

					JACK
			Thats right. And that 
			would make us number one 
			in our market...
				(getting up)
			You mind if I stand?

		A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

		Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
		crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
		water...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Look, I know our paltry 
			little two million in 
			sales is about what you 
			spend on office supplies 
			in a year.  And I know 
			some regional trucking 
			company account is 
			nothing compared to a 
			sixty billion dollar 
			merger...

					ALAN
			Im not trying to knock 
			the tire business, Jack.

					JACK
				(a confident chuckle)
			Its okay, Alan. I get it. 
			Im in your shoes, Im 
			thinking exactly the same 
			thing...but heres the 
			thing. Business is 
			business.  Wall Street, 
			Main Street, its all 
			just a bunch of people 
			getting up in the morning, 
			trying to figure out how 
			the hell theyre gonna 
			send their kids to 
			college.  Its just 
			people...

		Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
		appears intrigued...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And I know people.

					ALAN
			Im sure you do...

					LASSITER
				(intervening)
			Lets let the man have 
			his say...

		Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

					JACK
				(to Mintz)
			Take you, for instance...

					ALAN
				(defensive)
			What about me?

					JACK
			You drink about sixteen 
			Diet Cokes a day. Youre 
			an excellent father, but 
			you feel guilty about the 
			time you spend away from 
			home. You drink bourbon, 
			but you offer your 
			clients scotch...

		Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And your wife decorated 
			this office...

		A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
		caught look on his face.

					LASSITER
			He certainly has your 
			number, Alan.

					JACK
				(turning to Lassiter)
			Youre a little tougher, 
			Peter.

		A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...

					JACK (CONTD)
			For one thing, you like 
			expensive things.

					LASSITER
				(smiling proudly) 
			Thats easy. Youve seen 
			my car.

					JACK
				(a chuckle)
			Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
			Monterreys. Youre a 
			scotch man, single malt, 
			not because its trendy 
			but because youve been 
			doing it for forty years, 
			and you stay with what 
			works. You have two great 
			loves in your life, your 
			horses and this company.  
			You wept openly the day 
			the Dow hit ten thousand...

		Lassiters impressed.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And youre a man who 
			prides himself on finding 
			talent in unusual 
			places...


					LASSITER
			Oh? And how would you 
						know that?

		Jack smiles.

					JACK
			Because Im here.

		On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
		smile.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Im prepared to do 
			anything it takes to get 
			this job. Start anywhere 
			you need me to start.  
			Ill park cars if I 
			to...
				(into Lassiters 
				 eyes)
			The biggest part of 
			judging character is 
			knowing yourself. And I 
			know this, I can do this 
			job. Give me a chance, 
			Peter, I wont let you 
			down.

		Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a 
		moment, he turns to Mintz.

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, why dont you show 
			Jack around a bit...

					ALAN
			Id love to.

		CUT TO:

    100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
		EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
		back...

					ALAN
				(pointing)
			...thats our war room.  
			We did seven major deals 
			last year, three of them 
			hostile.

					JACK
				(not particularly 
				 impressed)
			Seven.  Really.

		They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
		the corridor.

		Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs 
		gaze with a quizzical look.

					ALAN
			Lets cut the shit, huh 
			Campbell? What, did you go 
			through his wallet or 
			something?

		Jacks a little taken aback.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			No matter. That circus 
			act back there may have 
			dazzled Lassiter 
			momentarily but it 
			doesnt do shit forme.  
			Even if you get this job, 
			which I highly doubt, let 
			me warn you, Lassiter 
			loses interest in his pet 
			projects very quickly. 
			Im in the big office 
			because Ive proved 
			myself to him year after 
			year and nobody is going 
			to come in here and start 
			turning the old mans 
			head. Especially not some 
			tire salesman from New 
			Jersey. So you watch 
			yourself and stay away 
			from Lassiter, and maybe, 
			just maybe, Ill keep you 
			on after he gets tired of 
			you. Do we understand 
			each other?

		Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
		expressionless.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Do we?!

		Then, a broad smile from Jack.

					JACK
			God, you really are 
			different, arent you...
				(nodding)
			I mean...wow...I am 
			impressed.

		Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Good for you. Why shouldnt 
			you protect whats yours.

					ALAN
			I dont think youre hearing 
			me.

					JACK
			Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.  
			Thats not the problem.  
			The problem is that what 
			you think is yours, is 
			really mine.  And I dont 
			care how low on the totem 
			pole I start, I will get 
			it back...
				(poking him in 
				 the chest)
			So do yourself a favor and 
			dont get too attached to 
			that view because sometime 
			soon, maybe very soon, you
			and your French country 
			antiques, your chintz sofa, 
			and your little play pen 
			are gonna be moving out of 
			that office.

		Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Oh, and by the way, you 
			try selling tires for a 
			living.  I promise you, 
			youd starve.

		Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
		leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

		CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

		CUT TO:

    101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

		A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
		duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

					JACK
			Welcome to Xanadu...

		The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
		lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
		its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
		house.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Pretty incredible, isnt 
			it?

					KATE
			Its like a museum.

		Jack nods.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to Jack)
			So whats the big 
			surprise? You didnt 
			rent this place for 
			the weekend, did you?

					JACK
			Think bigger.

					KATE
			For the week?

		Jack chuckles.

					JACK
			This place is a perk, 
			Kate.

					KATE
			A perk for what?

					JACK
			A company called P.K. 
			Lassiter and Associates 
			Investment House uses it 
			to attract new 
			executives...

		Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre talking to their 
			new Vice President of 
			Mergers and Acquisitions.

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about, Jack?


					JACK
			Im going into arbitrage, 
			honey.  Turns out I have 
			a knack for it.  Ill be 
			making two hundred grand 
			a year plus a hefty bonus
			and thats just to 
			start.  And, we can live 
			in this apartment 
			practically rent free for 
			as long as we want.

		Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...

					JACK (CONTD)
			We can finally afford to 
			move back into the city.  
			In style.

		Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

					KATE
			Are you out of your mind?

					JACK
			I dont think so. This 
			is going to be a better 
			life for all of us, 
			honey.  Well put Annie 
			and Josh in private 
			schools...

					KATE
			Annie goes to a great 
			school.

					JACK
			Im talking about the 
			best schools in the 
			country here, Kate...

					KATE
			Jack, what could you 
			possibly be thinking?  
			What about my job?

					JACK
			This is New York City, 
			its like the needy 
			people capital of the 
			world.  Those Jersey 
			clients of yours arent a 
			tenth as pathetic as the 
			ones you could get 
			here...

					KATE
				(cutting him off)
			I cant believe you want 
			to move back into the 
			city.  I thought the 
			reason we left was 
			because we didnt want to 
			raise the kids here?

					JACK
			No, this is the center of 
			the universe.  If I were 
			living in Roman times, I 
			would live in Rome, where 
			else?  Today, America is 
			the Roman Empire and New 
			York is Rome itself. 
			John Lennon.

					KATE
				(cutting him off) 
			Jack.

		Jacks starting to struggle...

					JACK
			Look, Im detecting a 
			kind of funky tension 
			here...We dont have to 
			live in this apartment. 
			I dont need this...Ill 
			commute...Ill drive to 
			work...

		Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
		apart...

					KATE
			In traffic?  Its over an 
			hour each way?  Thats 
			almost three hours a 
			day.  When are you going 
			to see the kids?

		Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
		himself. Then...

					JACK
			Kate. Youre not 
			understanding me. Im 
			talking about a great 
			life.  A perfect life.  
			Everything we pictured 
			when we were young. The 
			whole package. You said 
			it yourself, life has 
			thrown us surprises, and 
			so we made sacrifices.  
			But now I can finally get 
			us back on track...

		A sad chuckle from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I can do that.  I want to 
			do that.  For all of us.  
			I need to do that as a 
			man...
				(imploring her)
			Think about it.  No more 
			lousy restaurants, no 
			more clipping coupons, no 
			more shoveling snow...

					KATE
			Then get a goddamn snow 
			blower!

		Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont get a new career 
			without even telling me.  
			Dont take Annie out of a 
			school she loves.  Dont 
			move us out of a house 
			weve become a family 
			in...

		Kate stands there, wounded...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(quietly)
			Dont do that...

					JACK
			Look, youre making this 
			into something its not. 
			This isnt a referendum 
			on our lives, Kate. Its 
			a step forward...
				(appealing to her)
			Dont you see?  Im 
			talking about us finally 
			having a life other 
			people envy.

		Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing 
		look...

					KATE
			They already do envy us, 
			Jack...

		Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    102  OMITTED

    103	INT. ANNIES ROOM - NIGHT

		Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
		walks in.

		Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
		notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

					JACK
			Very nice. What is it?

					ANNIE
			Mary Had A Little Lamb.

					JACK
			Ah. A classic...

		Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
		dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
		down its sides...

		Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally 
		contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

		Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

		Jack turns to her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please dont stop...

		She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
		to the pictures...

    104	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

		Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

		He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the 
		surface of the desk...

		He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
		bookshelf...a book...

		He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a 
		tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.  He pulls 
		it off the shelf, theres something inside...a 
		bookmark...

		...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

		...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow, 
		To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.

		He looks at it...somethings not right...

					JACK
			From London to New York...?
				(looking up)
			I came back...

		Then...a NOISE...

		Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
		standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
		ticket sleeve.

					KATE
			Our finest moment, 
			right...

		A quizzical look from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			When you got on that 
			plane I was sure it was 
			over.  I left the airport 
			afraid Id never see you 
			again.  And then you 
			showed up the very next 
			day...
				(a wistful smile)
			That was a good 
			surprise...

		She continues into the room, leaning against a 
		bookshelf.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think about you on that 
			plane, about what must 
			have been going through 
			your mind...you sitting 
			there imagining our life 
			together, our life 
			apart...I think about the 
			decision you made...

		Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Maybe I was being naive 
			but I believed wed grow 
			old together in this 
			house.  That wed spend 
			holidays here, have g
			randchildren visit us 
			here.  I had this image 
			of us all grey and 
			wrinkly, me working in 
			the garden, you 
			repainting the deck...

		Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Things change, right?  
			People change...
				(pausing)
			If you need this, Jack, I 
			mean really need this, I 
			will take these children 
			from a life they love, 
			and take myself from the 
			only home weve ever 
			shared, and move wherever 
			you need to go.  Ill do 
			that because I love 
			you...

		The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I love you, Jack. And  
			thats more important to 
			me than our address...

		Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
		kisses him gently on the forehead.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I choose us.

		She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
		the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
		her as she goes...

    105	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks into the room...

		The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

		He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

		Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
		to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
		her, drawing her in...

		In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.  He 
		savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

		They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
		person.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    106	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
		her eyes.  Jacks not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

		Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

		She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
		revealing...

		Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
		snow with Annie and Josh.

		Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
		face...

    107	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

		...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
		delight...

		The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

		The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks 
		joy is just as palpable...

		Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
		neck, hugging his tight.

					ANNIE
				(whispering in 
				 Jacks ear)
			I knew youd come back...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    108	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

		Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
		until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
		its empty...

		And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
		RINGING, echoing through the room.

		A shudder passes through his body...

		He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
		sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

		Its an eerie moment for Jack...

					JACK
			What are you doing?

					ANNIE
				(a curious look)
			Ringing my bell...

		On Jacks anxious face...

    109  OMITTED
 
		CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE

    110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

		On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
		convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
		salt...

		He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

					JACK
			Four ninety nine?! Its just 
			salt for gods sake...

		On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
		GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

		She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
		of gum...

		From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
		the counter...

		On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
		salt from the shelf, when...

					CASH (O.S.)
			Thatll be sixty five cents, 
			little angel...

		Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
		over to the front counter...where he sees...

		Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
		uniform, ringing up the teenager...

		An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

					JACK
			You...!

		Then...the color drains from Jacks face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			What are you doing here...

		Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre not sending me 
			back...

		The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
		bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
		to Cash...

					CASH
			Jack, its good to see 
			you...

		Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
		ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(to the girl)
			Thank you darlin...

		The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
		given her the wrong change...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(back to Jack, 
				 seeing the
				 rock salt)
			What do you got there, 
			rock salt?  Look at you, 
			all domestic and shit...
			You really figured some 
			things out, huh?

		The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

					JACK
			Im not going back...

		The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

					CASH 
				(to the girl)
			Everything okay...?

		She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

					TEENAGE GIRL
			Yeah...fine.

					JACK
				(raising his voice)
			Hey! Did you hear me...?!

		Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
		the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

		A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches 
		into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

		Cash looks at Jack.

					CASH 
				(making a note 
				 in his book)

			That was a character issue...
				(shaking his head)
			...and for nine dollars?  
			Thats just sad...

					JACK
			Hey, Im talking to you!  
			I am not going back, do you 
			understand...?!

		Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant do this. You 
			cant keep coming in and 
			out of peoples lives, 
			messing things up...

					CASH
			Cmon, Jack...

		Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

					JACK
			Ive got kids, Im going 
			home...

					CASH
			You know what the word 
			glimpse means, J? Its 
			by nature an impermanent 
			thing.

		Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
		turns at the door...

					JACK
				(pointing at 
				 Cash)
			Im staying.

		Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs 
		face as Jack leaves...

    111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly.

		Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
		wake him.

    112	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIES ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

					ANNIE
				(stirring, groggy)
			Is it morning yet?

					JACK
			No, honey. Go back to 
			sleep.

		She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
		looking at her, sadness all over his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Take care of yourself,
			Annie.  Im going back to 
			the mother ship...

		Finally, he turns to go...

    113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as 
		Jack walks in.

					KATE
				(looking up from 
				 her book)
			Hey...

		Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

					JACK
			These last weeks, Kate, I 
			know that Ive done 
			some...some unusual 
			things.

		Kate nods.

					KATE
			Its been interesting, 
			thats for sure.

					JACK
			But Ive done some good 
			things too, havent I?

					KATE
			Youve been Jack 
			Campbell.  And thats 
			always a good thing...

		She kisses him on the cheek.

		He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
		eyes.

					JACK
			I need you to remember 
			me, Kate.  How I am right 
			now, right this very 
			moment.  I need you to 
			put that image in your 
			heart and keep it with 
			you, no matter what 
			happens.

					KATE
			Are you okay, Jack?

					JACK
			Please, just promise me 
			youll do that. You have 
			to promise, Kate. 
			Because if you dont, 
			then its like it never 
			happened and I dont 
			think I could live with 
			that.

		Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love 
		with him.

					KATE
			I promise, Jack...

					JACK
			Promise me again...

					KATE
			I promise. Come to bed, 
			honey.

		Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

					JACK
			Soon...

    114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		Snow begins to fall...

		Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
		mind elsewhere...

		Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
		field...

		Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
		open field.

		Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
		into the field, looking for just the right spot.

		Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
		half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
		his mouth...

		He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
		face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and 
		still...the air clean and crisp...

		He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
		in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The room is dark...

		Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

		He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
		look in his eyes...

		As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
		eyelids appear to grow heavy...

		He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
		focusing on her...but its no use...

		Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
		sleep...

		CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

		A PHONE RINGING

		Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
		his face ...he stirs...

		THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

		Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one 
		there.

		Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
		his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

		Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not 
		wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

					JACK
				(groggy, dazed)
			Yeah...okay, send her 
			up...

		He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes 
		stay closed for another moment...then...

		His eyes open...

		He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
		old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(sadly)
			Damnit.

		Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.  He gets out of 
		bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
		the room...

    117	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack walks to the door just as...

		The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
		the door, seeing...

		PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
		face.

					PAULA
			Waiting for me by the door, 
			huh?

		Jack looks at her.

					JACK
			Paula...

		Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on 
		underneath is a sexy little teddy.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(momentarily 
				  distracted)
			Thats totally see through...

					PAULA
				(smiling)
			Merry Christmas...

					JACK
				(confused)
			Christmas?  It cant be 
			Christmas...

		Jack stares at her, totally confused...

					PAULA
				(lasciviously)
			Its whatever you want it 
			to be, Jack...

		Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
		shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
		running down the corridor.

					PAULA (CONTD)			
			Jack?...Jack!

		CUT TO:

    118	EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
		out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

		A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
		Jack stares at him in shock.

					MAN
			Can I help you?

					JACK
			Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
			here?!

					MAN
			Kate? No, theres no one here 
			named Kate.  Is that good 
			enough for you?

		Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
		much to the shock of the guy standing there.

					JACK
			Damn...damn...damn...

					MAN
			Hey, are you okay?

					JACK
			No...Im not...

					MAN
			Is there anything I can do 
			for you?

		Jack shakes his head mournfully.

					MAN (CONTD)
			Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.  
			You got a cigarette?

					JACK
			Im sorry, no...

		Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120	EXT. ARNIES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

		Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
		to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
		of the driveway.

					ARNIE
				(shouting at Jack)
			Hey, you cant park that 
			thing here.

					JACK
				(out the window)
			Its me, Jack...

					ARNIE
			I dont care if youre Tim 
			Allen with your fancy car 
			and all your tools, you 
			still cant park here.

					JACK
			Tell me you recognize me, 
			Arnie.  Please...

					ARNIE
			Howd you know my name?

					JACK
			We bowl together. Were 
			bowlers ...we won a 
			championship...were winners.

					ARNIE
			I never won anything in 
			bowling.

		Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wait a second...
				(thinking)
			Jack...Jack...

					JACK
			Yes...Jack Campbell...

					ARNIE
			Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
			went to high school with
			you...you played baseball, 
			right?
				(at the Ferrari)
			Youre doing well...

					JACK
				(remembering)
			Yes, thats it...yes, we 
			went to high school together.

					ARNIE
			You never really talked to 
			me.  I wanted to talk to 
			you, man...

					JACK
			Yeah...I guess I just 
			wanted you to know, we 
			couldve been really good 
			friends...

    120A	INT. FERRARI - DAY

		Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

		A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since 
		hes heard that sound.

					JACK
				(answering phone) 
			Hello?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			Hey Santa, where are you?  
			Everybodys here.

					JACK
			Adelle?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			You were supposed to be here 
			half an hour ago...the 
			emergency strategy session?  
			Your trip to Aspen? Theyre 
			all panicked here...

		Silence from Jack...

					ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
			Jack...? Are you going through 
			the tunnel?

		Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

					JACK
			Ill be there in twenty 
			minutes...

		CUT TO:

    121	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

		Its a beehive of activity...

		Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
		charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

		Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
		a moment to observe the action...

		Mintz spots him...

					ALAN
				(into phone)
			Thank god, Jacks here. Ill 
			call you right back...

		He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
		Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

					ALAN (CONTD)
				(approaching)
			Jack, are you okay?

					JACK
				(in a daze)
			Whats going on here?

					ALAN
			Its not good.  Bob Thomas 
			has secretly been talking to 
			a European drug company.  
			Were not sure which one, 
			Julias on it right now.  
			Word is theyre willing to 
			let him buy a minority stake 
			and keep running the entire 
			company.  The Global people 
			are up in arms.  They say 
			we shouldve been prepared 
			for this.  Were in trouble 
			here, Jack...

		Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

					JACK
			You know something, Alan.  
			Theres a much more assertive 
			person somewhere inside of 
			you...

		Alan looks at him, confused.

					ALAN
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			But I think I like you better 
			this way...

					ALAN
			Is this another one of those 
			Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

		A sad laugh from Jack.

					JACK
			No.

					ALAN
			So what are we gonna do, 
			Jack?

		Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack...?		 

		Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
		the group...

					JACK
			Ill tell you exactly what 
			were going to do.  Youre
			going to do whatever you 
			have to do to find out which 
			European company hes been 
			talking to.  Then Im going 
			to clean myself up, fly to 
			Aspen, and drink egg nog 
			with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
			and kids will be playing in 
			the background while I spend 
			Christmas day convincing him 
			that the European company is 
			the devil and Global is the 
			answer to his prayers, after 
			all...
				(growing wistful)
			Then Im going to spend four 
			hours skiing. Alone. On 
			Christmas day. Completely 
			and utterly alone. Im going 
			to do that because that is 
			my life, that is whats 
			real, and there is nothing 
			I can do to change that...

		Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
		team.

    122	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

		Jacks limo makes its way downtown.

    123	INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

		Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
		the window, watching the buildings pass by...

		He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
		up...

					JACK
				(dialing 411)
			For Manhattan...Kate 
			Reynolds...I need an address 
			too...

		Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
		hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
		window, then turns to the driver...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Make a right here...

					DRIVER
			But the airports the other
			way...

					JACK
			Were not going to the 
			airport...

		CUT TO:

		123A	EXT. KATES BUILDING - DAY

		Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
		Mews...

		Jack gets out...

    124	INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

		Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
		Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.

		He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
		lower...

		Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
		exchanges a curious look with her.

					LORI
			Are you from the shipping 
			company?

					JACK
			Im Jack Campbell...Im an 
			old... friend of Kates.  
			I just called.

		The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

					LORI (O.S.)
			Kate! Some guys here!

		Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

					KATE (O.S)
				(to Lori)
			Did you call the airline 
			like I asked?!

		Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
		and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
		same.

					JACK
			Kate...

					KATE
			Jack...God, its been so 
			long...You look...

		She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

					JACK
			You look great.

					KATE
			Its good to see you...

		She looks at him another moment, then turns...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(yelling inside)
			Lori! Wheres that box?!

		Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

		125	INT. KATES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
		sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
		SHATTERING it...

					JACK
				(bending down)
			I'm sorry...

					KATE
			Dont worry about it, Jack...

		Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the 
		phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
		up...

					JACK
			Whats going on?

					KATE
				(searching around)
			Im moving to Paris...it was 
			right here...
				(to Lori)
			Its a box marked Jack.  I 
			put it in the stack for the 
			Salvation Army...

					JACK
			Paris?

					LORI
				(to Kate, with 
				 attitude)
			Do you want me to look for 
			the box or call the airline?

					KATE
			Hey, kind of under a little 
			pressure here.

					LORI
			Hey, kind of giving up 
			Christmas day for my ex-boss 
			here.

		Jack watches this back and forth.

					KATE
			You didnt seem to mind 
			offering to help me on 
			Christmas day when you were 
			unwrapping that Prada bag 
			I gave you.

					LORI
			Maybe its by the wardrobe 
			boxes...

		Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

					JACK
			Youre moving...

					KATE
			Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
			has an office there and 
			Im going to be heading 
			it up.

					JACK
				(stunned)
			To Paris. Paris, France.

					KATE
				(searching the 
				 boxes)
			Thats the one...

					JACK
			So youre not at a non-
			profit firm?

					KATE
				(a chuckle)
			Not with what they pay me...

					JACK
			Youre not married, are 
			you?

					KATE
			No, Jack, I never got 
			married. You?

					JACK
			Not exactly...
				(looking around)
			Can we just take a minute 
			here?  Maybe get a cup of 
			coffee or something...?

					LORI
				(yelling)
			Ill go for a cup of coffee!

					KATE
			Yes!

		A relieved smile from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it!

					LORI
			Congratulations. The La 
			Guardia flights canceled 
			but I got you out of 
			Kennedy on United at nine.  
			Am I good or what?

		Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
		marked, Jack...

					KATE
			Here you go.  Its just 
			some old things of yours...

		Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

					JACK
			Do you ever think about us, 
			Kate?  About what might 
			have happened...?

		A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees hes not 
		laughing...

					KATE
			Youre serious...

		A nod from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Ill tell you what, Jack, 
			if youre ever in Paris, 
			look me up. Maybe well 
			go for that cup of coffee.

		One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

		Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
		this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years 
		ago, or left yesterday.

					JACK
			Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

		He leaves...

		CUT TO:

		126	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - EVENING

		A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love, 
		fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his 
		side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

		He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
		material, then a Mondale for President button, which 
		Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
		ticket stubs...

		He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
		button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
		finding...

		A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one 
		Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

		Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
		then...

		He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.

		CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  ONE LAST TRY

		CUT TO:

	127	EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

		Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 
		MPH...

		He looks at the clock, it reads, 8:46. He opens up 
		the throttle...

	128	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

		Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal 
		then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
		sees him...

					AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
			Hey, you cant leave that 
			there!

		Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

	129	INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

		Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris - 
		Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

	130	INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

		...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
		Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
		front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
		attendant.

		He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
		annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

					JACK
				(calling out)
			Kate!

		Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
		face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant go!

					KATE
			Jesus, Jack...

					JACK
			Dont get on that plane!

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Please. Lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee. Thats all 
			Im asking for. Im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			Paris tonight.

					KATE
			What do you want from me? 
			You want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay?

		Jack just stands there, unsure...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Well it is. Yes, I was 
			heartbroken ...But I got 
			over it. I moved on. 
			People change, Jack. I 
			changed. I dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but I assure 
			you, its over...

		Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
		there...

		He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes 
		right...

		He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
		attendant...

		Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

					JACK
				(at Kate)
			We have a house in Jersey!

		Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

					KATE
			Dont do this, Jack...
			But he continues...

					JACK
			We have two kids, Annie and 
			Josh...

		...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
		interested...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard. Shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind. And when she 
			smiles...

		Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
		tears...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And Josh...he has your eyes. 
			He doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart...
				(lost in the memory)
			...hes always got his eyes 
			open, always watching us...
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new...
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle...

		Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity.

					JACK (CONTD)
			...the house is a mess, but 
			its ours...
				(chuckling)
			...well, after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be...

		Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
		the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And you...youre a non-
			profit lawyer. Thats right, 
			completely non-profit. But 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you...

		Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought 
		about.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And were in love. After 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love...
				(with a chuckle)
			You wont even let me touch 
			you until Ive said it...

		Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now... 
		imagining the picture Jacks painting...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...I sing to you...not all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions...

		Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(off hand, to passenger)
			Excuse me...
				(to Kate)
			We made a lot of sacrifices, 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises, but we stayed 
			together...

		Jacks nearly there...

					JACK (CONTD)
			You see, youre a better 
			person than I am...

		Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and it made me a better 
			person to be around you...

		Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her 
		ears.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Maybe it was all a 
			dream. Maybe I went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			December and imagined it 
			all. But I swear, 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me...

		Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes 
		off him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And if you get on that 
			plane right now, itll 
			disappear forever.

		Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
		world...airport business going on around them...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I know we can both go on 
			with our lives. And wed 
			both be fine. But Ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			together...And I choose 
			us...

		Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
		hand to her arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please, Kate, one cup of 
			coffee. You can always go 
			to Paris. Just please, not 
			tonight...

		She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes, 
		searching for the answer.

					KATE
			Okay, Jack...

		DISSOLVE TO:

	131	INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
		falling outside.

		From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
		a cup of coffee...

		FADE OUT.

                                                          FIRST DRAFT




          HAZEL GRACE LANCASTER (16) lies in the grass, staring up at
          the stars. We're CLOSE ON her FACE and we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           You have a choice in this world, I
           believe, about how to tell sad
           stories.

          CUT TO a SERIES OF QUICK IMAGES:
          - Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS "GUS"
          WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
          [They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           On the one hand, you can sugar coat
           - the way they do in movies and
           romance novels.

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus sit on a BENCH
          overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
          She rests her head on his shoulder.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Where villains are vanquished
           and... heroes are born and...
          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus kiss in a dark room.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... beautiful people learn
           beautiful lessons...

          - "Perfect" Hazel and "Perfect" Gus fall onto a bed together.
          They look deep into one another's eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... and nothing is too messed up
           that can't be fixed with an apology
           and a Peter Gabriel song.

          BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
          those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I like that way as much as the next
           girl, believe me. It's just not the
           truth.

          Hazel closes her eyes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           This is the truth.
          And EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. We HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Sorry.

           FADE IN ON:

           2.

                         

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          The real Hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Late in the Winter of my 17th
           year...

          There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
          First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
          help her to breathe.

          Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
          grass. It's much shorter than the "Perfect" version, the
          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
          years before.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... my mother decided I was
           depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. Her
          mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
          to the DOCTOR:

                          FRANNIE
           ... she eats like a bird. She
           barely leaves the house,

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed.

                          FRANNIE
           ... she reads the same book over
           and over...

                          DOCTOR
           She's depressed.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not depressed!

          Off her look, CUT TO:

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           The booklets and web sites always
           list depression as a side effect of
           cancer...

          - A SHOPPING MALL. Filled with TEENAGE GIRLS - gossipping,
          laughing - being teenage girls, basically. And here's Hazel.
          With her Mom. And her oxygen tank. Just another day.

           3.

                         

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Depression's not a side effect of
           cancer...

          - HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM. She sits watching game shows in the
          middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
          glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
          Hazel eyes them with indifference.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... it's a side effect of dying.

          - A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
          underlined copy of a novel ("An Imperial Affliction" by Peter
          Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
          - goes back to the book.

                          HAZEL (V.O.)
           Which is what was happening to me.

          And we CUT BACK TO:

                         

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME

          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor. Hazel continues to
          dangle her feet.

                          FRANNIE
           ... some days she won't even get
           out of bed.
          The Doctor scratches his beard, thinking.

                          DOCTOR
           I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
           Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
           once.

                          HAZEL
           Why stop there?

                          DOCTOR
           Hmm?

                          HAZEL
           Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
           like the Keith Richards of cancer
           kids.
          The Doctor looks at Frannie who just shakes her head.

                          DOCTOR
           Have you been going to that Support
           Group I suggested?
          Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.

           4.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           She's gone a few times.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not sure it's for me.

                          FRANNIE
           Hazel.

                          DOCTOR
           Just give it a chance, ok? For me.
          Hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.

                          DOCTOR
           Who knows? You might even find
           it... enlightening.

          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
          CLOSE UP on PATRICK (30s, pony-tail). He has a guitar.

                          PATRICK
           ... we are gathered here today -
           literally - in the heart of Jesus.
          ANGLE on Hazel who just shakes her head. This is the lamest
          thing she could be doing right now.

                          PATRICK
           Who would like to share their story
           with the group?
          The basement is filled with SICK PEOPLE. Hazel among them.
          Most are under the age of 18. QUICK CUTS:

                          PATRICK
           Patrick. 34. Testicular. It started
           a few years ago, when I was...
          As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I'll spare you the gory details of
           Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,
           they found it in his nuts, cut most
           of it out, he almost died, but he
           didn't die, and now here he is -
           divorced, friendless, addicted to
           video games, exploiting his
           cancertastic past in the heart of
           Jesus - "literally" - to show us
           that one day - if we're lucky - we
           could be just like him.
          They all say:

           ALL IN UNISON
           "We're here for you Patrick."
          Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
          her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
          patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head.

                          PATRICK
           Who else would like to share?

                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Hazel?
          Oh no. Patrick gestures for her to speak. Reluctantly she
          stands, sighs...

                          HAZEL
           I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.

                          (BEAT)
           Thyroid originally but with quite
           the impressive satellite colony in
           my lungs.
          Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.

                          PATRICK
           And how are you doing Hazel?
          Hazel has no idea how to answer that.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           You mean besides the terminal
           cancer?

           6.

                         
          But that's not what she says. She says:

                          HAZEL
           Alright? I guess...?
          Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.

           ALL IN UNISON
           "We're here for you Hazel."
          Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.

                          PATRICK
           Maybe now I'll play a song...

                         

          EXT CHURCH - LATER
          Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
          book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
          open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks
          at her like "well, was it great?" Hazel just exhales and gets
          in the car. CUT TO:

          side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.
          Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to
          stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but
          trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:

                          FRANNIE
           It's Friday night.

                          HAZEL
           Hmm?

                          FRANNIE
           I was just thinking... you should
           call your friends, see what they're
           up to.

                          HAZEL

                          (DISINTERESTED)
           That's ok.
          Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.

                          MICHAEL
           Wanna see a movie?
          Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.

                          HAZEL
           Why don't you guys go to a movie?

           Go. Have fun. Take the night off.
          Frannie and Michael look at one another again.

                          MICHAEL
           This is a really good show.
          Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what

           Of course we can, we're your
           parents.
          Hazel frowns.

                          MICHAEL
           Hazel, you need to get out of the
           house. Make friends. Be a teenager.

                          HAZEL
           If you want me to be a teenager,
           don't send me to Support Group. Buy
           me a fake ID so I can go to clubs
           and drink gimlets and take pot.

           You don't take pot.

          Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Not because I wanted to or because
           I thought it would help. But for
           the same reason I did anything
           these days...
          Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
          assistance.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... to make my parents happy.

                          HAZEL
           Are you gonna sit here and wait the
           whole time?

                          FRANNIE
           Of course not, no. I...
           (she totally is)
           I have errands to run.
          Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
          doesn't press the issue.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.

                          FRANNIE

           The only thing worse than biting it
           from cancer - is having a kid bite
           it from cancer.
          As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:

           9.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           Make some friends!
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

                         

          INT CHURCH - SAME
          Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
          KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it.

                          HAZEL
           I'll take the stairs.
          The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
          always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:

                         

                          GUS HAZEL
          Ooph. Sorry!

                         
          A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
          Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
          eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.

                          GUS HAZEL
          My bad. No, it's...

                         
          For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
          one another. Hazel is speechless.

                          HAZEL
           Excuse me.
          With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
          Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:

                         

          INT BATHROOM - SAME
          Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
          herself.
          She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
          Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:

                         

          INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
          Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick.

                          PATRICK
           Who would like to begin?
          No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
          sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
          flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away.

           10.

                         

                          PATRICK
           Isaac, I know you're facing a
           challenging time. Perhaps you would
           like to say something...
          Isaac nods, rises.

                          ISAAC
           Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
           cancer.

                          (BEAT)
           It's looking like another surgery
           in a couple weeks. After which,
           well, I'll be blind...
          Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
          difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her.

                          ISAAC
           Not that I'm complaining or
           anything. I know a lot of you have
           it way worse but, still, I mean,
           you know, being blind's gonna
           suck...
          As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
          Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
          irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
          meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
          A staring contest.

                          ISAAC
           ...My girlfriend helps. And friends
           like Augustus here...
          Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
          AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel.

                          ISAAC
           So... yeah. That's what's up.

           ALL IN UNISON
           "We're here for you Isaac."
          The staring contest continues another few beats until:

                          PATRICK
           And does your friend want to speak?
          This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
          he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
          as if to say "Victory is mine!" He smiles back at her, the
          most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group.

                          GUS
           Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
           touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
           and a half ago - lost this baby as
           a result...

           11.

                         
          Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.

                          GUS
           But really I'm just here at Isaac's
           request.

                          PATRICK
           And how are you feeling Augustus?

                          GUS
           Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
           coaster that only goes up, my
           friend.
          Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
          smiling and looks away.

                          PATRICK
           Perhaps you'd like to share your
           fears with the group, Augustus.

                          GUS
           My fears?
          Gus thinks about this.

                          GUS
           Oblivion.

                          PATRICK
           Oblivion?
          ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.

                          GUS
           Yeah, see... I intend to live an
           extraordinary life. To be
           remembered. If I'm scared of
           anything it's... not doing that.
          Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.

                          PATRICK
           Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
           that?
          And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.

                          PATRICK
           Hazel! That's unexpected.
          Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
          watches her, waits for it.

                          HAZEL
           I just wanna say... there will come
           a time when, you know, all of us
           are dead.
          Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.

           12.

                         

                          HAZEL
           It might be tomorrow. Might be a
           million years from now but... it's
           gonna happen. And when it does,
           enough generations will come and
           go, there'll be no one left to
           remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
           Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
           right?
          The look on Gus's face is unreadable.

                          HAZEL
           Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
           scares you, well, I suggest you
           ignore it. God knows it's what
           everyone else does.
          A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
          not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
          Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
          Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
          redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
          against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
          kisses, we can hear:

                          ISAAC MONICA
          Always. Always.

                         
          And Hazel hears:

                          GUS
           Literally.
          Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
          right next to her.

                          GUS
           I thought we were in a church
           basement but apparently we were
           literally in the heart of Jesus.
          Hazel smiles.

                          HAZEL
           Someone should probably tell him,
           don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
           dangerous keeping all these kids
           with cancer in your heart.
          Gus laughs.

                          GUS
           What's your name?

           13.

                         

                          HAZEL
           Hazel.

                          GUS
           No your full name?

                          HAZEL

                          (CONFUSED)
           Hazel Grace Lancaster.
          Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.

                          HAZEL
           What?

                          GUS
           I didn't say anything.

                          HAZEL
           Why are you looking at me like
           that?

                          GUS
           Because you're beautiful.
          Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.

                          GUS
           I enjoy looking at beautiful people
           and I decided a while back not to
           deny myself the simpler pleasures
           of existence. Particularly given
           that, as you so astutely pointed
           out, we're all gonna die pretty
           soon.

                          HAZEL

                          (BEAT)
           I'm not beaut --
          A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.

                          YOUNG GIRL
           Hey Gus.

                          GUS
           Hey Alisa.
          Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
          they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
          each other. She hears:

                         

                          ISAAC MONICA
          Always. Always.

                         

                          HAZEL
           What's with the "always?"

           14.

                         

                          GUS
           "Always" is their thing. They'll
           "always" love each other and
           whatnot. Must have texted "always"
           to each other at least four million
           times this year.
          They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
          squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn.

                          HAZEL
           He's gotta be hurting her boob.

                          GUS
           Let's watch a movie.
          Hazel is again surprised.

                          HAZEL
           Oh. Um. Uh...
           (yes!)
           Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this

                          WEEK--

                          GUS
           No I mean now.

                          HAZEL
           What?

                          GUS
           Hmm?

                          HAZEL
           What do you mean "now?"

                          GUS
           I've got a car.
          He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.

                          HAZEL
           You could be an axe murderer.

                          GUS
           There is that possibility.

                          (BEAT)
           Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.
          As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
          disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
          his lips.

                          HAZEL
           Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're
           kidding right?
           (off his look)
           You just ruined the whole thing!

           15.

                         

                          GUS
           Whole thing?

                          HAZEL
           What, you think that's cool? Oh you
           idiot! There's always a hamartia,
           isn't there? And yours is - even
           though you had FREAKING CANCER you
           give money to a corporation for the
           chance to acquire EVEN MORE
           CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
           well.
          As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
          his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing.

                          HAZEL
           Let me tell you... not being able
           to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks.

                          GUS
           Hamartia?
          Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.

                          HAZEL
           A fatal flaw.
          Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
          etched on his face.

                          GUS
           They don't hurt you unless you
           light them.

                          HAZEL
           Sorry?

                          GUS
           I've never lit one.
          Hazel turns back to him.

                          GUS
           It's a metaphor. See? You put the
           thing that kills you between your
           teeth. But you don't give it the
           power to do the killing.
          Hazel is floored. And impressed.

                          HAZEL
           Metaphor.
          Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.

                          FRANNIE
           Hi sweetheart. Ready for some
           "Model?"

           16.

                         
          Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
          anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom.

                          HAZEL
           Can't tonight.
           (off her confused look)
           I've made plans with Augustus
           Waters.
          And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
          the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
          awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:

                         

          INT GUS'S CAR - LATER
          Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
          driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
          seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
          snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face.

                          GUS
           I failed the test a couple times.

                          HAZEL
           You don't say.

                          GUS
           Most amputees can drive with no
           problem but... yeah. Not me.

                          HAZEL
           I'm surprised you have a license.

                          GUS
           Tell me about it!
          Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.

                          GUS
           The fourth time I took the test...
           it was going about how this is
           going... and when it was over, the
           instructor looks at me and goes,
           "your driving, while unpleasant...
           is not technically unsafe."

                          HAZEL
           Aha. Cancer perk.

                          GUS
           Total cancer perk.
          A few beats of silence.

                          GUS
           So what happened to you?
          Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
          somehow this seems different.

           17.

                         

                          HAZEL
           I was 13 when they found it.
          And as she speaks, we see it unfold. SMASH CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL BED - FLASHBACK
          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL has a biopsy.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Stage IV thyroid cancer.

                         

          INT OPERATING ROOM - FLASHBACK
          13-YEAR OLD HAZEL on the operating table. It's a nightmare.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I had surgery first.

                         

          INT SEVERAL MORE HOSPITAL ROOMS - FLASHBACK
          This poor little girl is taking a beating. And it's just
          getting started.
          - Radiation treatment.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Then Radiation...
          - Having her head shaved by Frannie.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Then Chemo...
          - With a PICC line in a chemo chair.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           All of which worked for a while.
          - A RADIOLOGIST looks at an X-ray. He's not pleased.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           And then stopped working.
          - 14-Year Old Hazel lies in bed, struggling to breathe.
          Frannie runs her fingers through her hair. Dad calls 9-1-1.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           And then my lungs started filling
           up with water.
          - In the ICU, her parents standing over her.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           That should have been the end.

           18.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          14-Year Old Hazel nods. Michael can't keep it together any
          longer. He completely breaks down.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           But it wasn't.

                         

          INT ICU - THE NEXT MORNING
          The sun shines in the room. 14-year old Hazel eats ice chips,
          the color has returned to her cheeks.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           The antibiotics kicked in. They
           drained the fluid from my lungs.
           And in time I got better. Stronger.

                         

          INT YET ANOTHER HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
          Slightly older Hazel is getting more intravenous medication.
          It's never ending.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I even found myself in an
           experimental trial. You know the
           ones that are famous in the
           Republic of Cancervania for not
           working.
          - A SECOND RADIOLOGIST examines a second X-ray.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           It's called Phalanxifor. Didn't
           work in over 70 percent of patients
           but, for some reason...
          The Radiologist looks surprised.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ...it worked in me. They called it
           "The Miracle."
          And finally, BACK TO:

                         

          INT GUS'S CAR - SAME
          Gus has one eye on the road, the other on Hazel. He was
          impressed with her before. He's totally dazzled now.

                          HAZEL
           Tumors shrank, my mets have hardly
           grown since...

                          (MORE)

           19.

                          HAZEL (CONT'D)
           Of course my lungs still suck but,
           theoretically, they could continue
           to suck in just this way for, I
           dunno, a while maybe.

                          GUS
           Wow.

                          HAZEL
           Yeah.

                          GUS
           So are you back in school or...?

                          HAZEL
           Can't.

                          GUS
           Why not?

                          HAZEL
           Got my GED.

                          GUS
           A college girl! Well that explains
           the aura of sophistication...
          He smiles at her. She smiles back. Shoves his upper arm
          playfully. They're easing into each other.
          Eventually Gus's car pulls into his driveway.

                          GUS
           We're here.
          He's as good at parking as he is at driving. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT/INT GUS'S HOUSE - SAME
          Hazel follows Gus inside. She quickly notices all sorts of
          engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like "Home is
          Where the Heart Is" and "True Love is Born from Hard Times."
          Hazel looks at Gus quizzically.

                          GUS
           My parents call them
           "encouragements."
           (rolling his eyes)
           Don't ask.
          Gus's MOM and DAD (40s) are in the kitchen making dinner.

                          GUS
           Hey guys.

                          GUS'S MOM
           Augustus, hi. New friend?

           20.

                         
          Gus's parents don't seem surprised to see Gus with some
          random girl in their house. Hazel takes note of that.

                          GUS
           This is Hazel Grace.

                          HAZEL
           It's just... Hazel.

                          GUS'S DAD
           How's it going, Just Hazel?

                          GUS

                          (ABRUPTLY)
           Downstairs if you need us!
          Gus drags Hazel to the next room. As she's pulled:

                          HAZEL
           Nice to meet you!
          They walk down the carpeted stairs - Gus having an easier
          time with his one leg than Hazel is with her oxygen tank and
          weak lungs.
          Eventually they arrive at Gus's basement bedroom. There's a
          TV with a video game console, a few band posters, and a whole
          host of basketball memorabilia (autographed sneakers, school
          trophies, framed images etc.) Gus sees her looking at them.

                          GUS
           I used to play.

                          HAZEL
           Must have been pretty good.

                          GUS
           These are mine. And these. The rest
           of it's just cancer perks.
          Gus grabs a DVD from his stack of DVDs. Hazel sits down on
          the bed, her breathing noticeably heavier.

                          HAZEL
           Need to sit.
          Gus sits down next to her on the bed.

                          HAZEL
           Don't get any ideas.
           (catching her breath)
           All that standing... and stairs...
           and then more standing... lotta
           standing for me.

                          GUS
           I understand.

           21.

                         

                          HAZEL
           I'll be fine in a minute. Unless I
           faint. I'm a bit of a Victorian
           lady, fainting-wise.
          Gus smiles. He waits for her breathing to slow down. In time:

                          GUS
           You ok?
          Hazel nods, smiles.

                          GUS
           So what's your story?

                          HAZEL
           I already told you my story. I was

                          DIAGNOSED --

                          GUS
           Not your cancer story. Your story.
           Interests, hobbies, passions, weird
           fetishes...

                          HAZEL
           Um...

                          GUS
           Don't tell me you're one of those
           people who becomes their disease.

                          HAZEL
           No. I'm just... I don't know... un-
           extraordinary.

                          GUS
           I reject that out of hand.
           (beat, Hazel shrugs)
           Think of something you love. First
           thing that comes to mind.

                          HAZEL
           "An Imperial Affliction."

                          GUS
           Ok. What's that?

                          HAZEL
           It's a novel. My favorite novel.

                          GUS
           Does it have zombies?

                          HAZEL

                          (LAUGHING)
           What? No.

                          GUS
           Stormtroopers.

           22.

                         

                          HAZEL
           Seriously?

                          (HE SHRUGS)
           It's not that kind of book.

                          GUS
           Sounds horrible.

                          HAZEL
           It's not, it's... kind of my bible
           actually.

                          GUS
           Interesting. What's it about?

                          HAZEL
           Cancer.
           (off his look)
           But not in that way, trust me. The
           guy who wrote it, Peter Van Houten,
           he's... well, the only person I've
           ever come across who seems to a)
           understand what it's like to be
           dying and b) not have died.

                          GUS

                          (INTRIGUED)
           In that case... I am going to read
           this horrible book with the boring
           title that does not contain zombies
           or stormtroopers. And in
           exchange...
          Gus pulls a book from his bookshelf.

                          GUS
           ... all I ask is that you read this
           brilliant and haunting novelization
           of my favorite video game.
          Hazel looks at the slim, ridiculous novella. She laughs.
          She's adorable when she laughs. She takes the book from him
          and as she does, their hands get tangled together for a
          brief, charged moment.

                          GUS
           Your hands are cold.

                          HAZEL
           Not so much cold as under-
           oxygenated.

                          GUS
           Ooh Hazel Grace...

                          (BEAT)
           I love it when you talk medical to
           me.
          Hazel blushes. And off her completely smitten smile, CUT TO:

           23.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
          Hazel sits in bed reading Gus's novella. Frannie stands in
          the doorway, notices the new book.

                          FRANNIE
           That's different.
          Hazel shrugs. Frannie looks intrigued.

                          FRANNIE
           Did he give it to you?

                          HAZEL
           By "it" do you mean herpes?
          Frannie rolls her eyes. Hazel's phone buzzes. She excitedly
          checks it - only to be disappointed. Frannie notices.

                          FRANNIE
           I'm sure he'll call, don't worry.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not worried. Please. It's not
           like I'm waiting for him to call or
           anything. I just... we hung out. No
           big deal.
          Frannie says nothing to that. Her silence says it all. Hazel
          rolls her eyes. CUT TO:

          QUICK SERIES OF SCENES:
          Hazel continues "not to wait" for Gus's call. We see her:
          - Brushing her teeth. And checking her phone.
          - Watching TV. And checking her phone.
          - Eating breakfast. And checking her phone.
          - Looking out the window on a rainy day. Trying not to check
          her phone. Willing herself to not check the goddamn phone.
          And checking the phone.
          Where is he?! Did he forget about her?

                         

          INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          Hazel at the dinner table with her parents. She's a little
          sullen, barely touching her food.
          Hazel's phone buzzes. She tries not to seem too eager to
          check it, what with her parents watching and all. She subtly
          looks down at her lap. And sure enough: a text from Gus! Her
          eyes bug out. We see:

           24.

                         
          "Tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something."
          Hazel smiles. Goes back to eating. Frannie and Michael share
          a quick glance. A second later, there's a follow-up text.
          "Tell me I have NOT reached the end of this book!"
          Hazel smiles again.
          And then a third text:

          "A BOOK CAN"T END IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE?! WHAT IN GOD'S

          NAME IS THIS MADNESS! AAAAHHHH!"
          Hazel now laughs out loud. Michael clears his throat. Hazel
          looks up.

                          MICHAEL
           Would you like to be excused?

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone. Gus
          answers on the first ring.

           GUS (O.S.)
           Hazel Grace.

                          HAZEL
           Welcome to the sweet torture of
           reading "An Imperial --"
          At which point she hears a loud WAIL coming from the other
          end of the phone.

                          HAZEL
           What the -- are you ok?

           GUS (O.S.)
           Me? Yeah. I'm excellent.
          INTERCUT between Hazel on the patio and:

                         

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME
          Isaac's head is buried in Gus's couch. He's wailing like a
          banshee, having some kind of nervous breakdown.

                          GUS

                          (INTO PHONE)
           I am, however, with Isaac.
          Hazel hears more wailing. Has no idea what to make of it.

           25.

                         

           GUS (O.S.)

                          (TO ISAAC)
           Dude! Hey! Does Support Group Hazel
           make this better or worse?
          Hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on.

                          GUS
           Isaac! Focus. On. Me.
          Hazel waits a few beats for Gus to come back on. Finally:

           GUS (O.S.)

                          (TO HAZEL)
           How fast can you get here?
          Hazel thinks about this. And on her face, CUT TO:

                         

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT - LATER
          Hazel descends the steps. She hears an ungodly moan before
          she sees anyone. What has she gotten herself into? Gus
          appears at the base.

                          GUS
           (calling to Isaac)
           Isaac, Hazel from Support Group is
           coming downstairs.
          Gus waits for a response. None comes. He gestures for her to
          follow him into the room. Before he does:

                          GUS
           A gentle reminder: Isaac is in the
           midst of a psychotic episode.

                          (HAZEL NODS)
           You look nice, by the way.
          Hazel blushes, follows Gus into the room to find Isaac
          sitting upside down in a gaming chair. Tears are flowing down
          his reddened cheeks. Empty soda cans and bags of junk food
          lie around him.

                          HAZEL
           How ya doing Isaac?
          Again, no response. Hazel looks to Gus for an explanation.

                          GUS
           Seems Isaac and Monica are no
           longer a going concern.

                          HAZEL
           Oh I'm sorry.

                          (BEAT)
           Do you want to talk about it?
          Isaac starts to sob again.

           26.

                         

                          GUS
           He just wants to cry and play video
           games.

                          HAZEL
           Fair enough.

                          GUS
           It doesn't hurt to talk to him,
           however. If you have any sage words
           of feminine advice...

                          HAZEL
           I actually think his response is
           appropriate.

                          GUS
           "Pain demands to be felt."

                          HAZEL
           (lights up at that)
           You're quoting my book!
          Gus winks at her. At which point, Isaac lets out another
          howl. Gus gestures for Hazel to sit. The two of them flank
          Isaac. He finally speaks.

                          ISAAC
           She didn't want to do it after the
           surgery. Said she couldn't handle
           it. I'm about to lose my eyesight
           and she can't handle it.
          Hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.

                          ISAAC
           I kept saying "always" to her.
           Always, always, always. And she
           just kept talking over me and not
           saying it back. It was like I was
           already gone, you know? "Always"
           was a promise! You can't break
           promises.

                          HAZEL
           Sometimes people don't understand
           the promises they're making when
           they make them.

                          ISAAC
           Right, sure, but you keep the
           promise anyway. That's what love
           is. Love is keeping the promise
           anyway.

                          GUS
           That could be an "encouragement."
          It's silent for a beat. And then Isaac stands up, a funny
          look on his face.

           27.

                         

                          GUS
           Isaac...?
          Suddenly Isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.

                          GUS
           Here we go...
          The chair lands against the bed. Gus hands Isaac something
          else to throw, a pillow. Isaac grabs the pillow and slams it
          against the wall. He dives on it and beings pummeling the
          pillow like a maniac.

                          GUS
           That's it! Punch that thing.
          And so he does. As he continues to, Gus looks at Hazel,
          cigarette dangling from his mouth.

                          GUS
           I've been wanting to call you on a
           nearly minutely basis but I have
           been waiting until I could form a
           coherent thought in re: "An
           Imperial Affliction."

                          (SHE SMILES)
           I can't stop thinking about it.

                          HAZEL
           I know, right?

                          GUS
           The only problem is the ending.

                          HAZEL
           It is rather abrupt.

                          GUS
           It's torture! I mean, I totally get
           that she died or whatever - Anna.
           But there is an unwritten contract
           between author and reader and I
           think ending your book in the
           middle of a sentence kind of
           violates that contract.

                          HAZEL
           But that's part of what I like
           about it. It portrays death
           truthfully. You die in the middle
           of your life, in the middle of a
           sentence. But I do - God, I do want
           to know what happens to everyone
           else.

                          GUS
           Yeah like her Mom.

           Sysiphus the Hamster...
          Hazel beams. Gus totally gets the book. A bond between them.

                          GUS
           Have you tried contacting this...
           Peter Van Houten?

                          HAZEL
           I've written letters. He's never
           responded. Apparently he moved to
           Amsterdam, became a recluse. Hasn't
           published anything. Doesn't do
           interviews.

                          GUS
           Sad.

                          (BEAT)
           Hang on.
           (turns to Isaac)
           Isaac!
          Gus stands and takes the pillow out of Isaac's hand.

                          GUS
           Pillows don't break.
          Gus hands Isaac one of his basketball TROPHIES.

                          GUS
           You need to break something.
          Isaac looks at it, then back to Gus as if asking permission.
          Gus nods. Isaac holds it over his head and SMASH! The trophy
          breaks into a million pieces. Isaac almost smiles. Gus hands
          him another.

                          GUS
           Go to town, my friend.
          And Isaac does. Smashing them one by one. Hazel looks at Gus.

                          GUS
           I've been looking for a way to tell
           my Dad that I kinda hate
           basketball. Think maybe we've found
           it.
          Isaac grabs more of the TROPHIES, smashing them to pieces.
          Gus and Hazel enjoy the spectacle. When there are none left
          Isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.

                          GUS
           Feel better?
          Isaac thinks about it. Shakes his head no. Gus puts his arm
          around him but looks at Hazel.

           29.

           That's the thing about pain... it
           demands to be felt.
          Hazel smiles. And on her face, we CUT TO:

           Dr. Maria called today. The PET
           Scan is set for the eighth.
          Hazel nods. This could be a source of worry but she's not
          going to think about that right now. She's upbeat. And she's
          actually eating, which her parents can't help but notice.
          Frannie and Michael look at one another, pleased.

                          FRANNIE
           I told you Support Group was a good
           idea.
          Hazel's phone buzzes. "Augustus." She looks to her parents.

           Hello Augustus.

                          GUS
           So I read it again. And I just kept
           feeling like... like it was a gift.
           Like you'd given me something
           important.

                          HAZEL

                          (TOUCHED)
           You're welcome.

                          GUS
           On the other hand... we need
           closure, don't we?

                          HAZEL
           What we need is a sequel.

                          GUS
           Yes. We need to know what happens
           to Anna's family after she dies.

                          HAZEL
           That's what I kept asking Van
           Houten for in my letters.

                          GUS
           But he never wrote back.

                          HAZEL
           That's correct.

                          GUS
           Because he's a recluse.

                          HAZEL

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Hazel sits at her computer, Van Houten's assistant's email
          address staring her in the face. The cursor blinks on a blank
          page. And then Hazel starts writing...

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           "Dear Mr. Peter Van Houten, my name
           is Hazel Grace Lancaster. My friend
           Augustus Waters, who read your book
           - at my recommendation - just
           received an email from you at this
           address. I hope you will not mind
           that he shared that email with me."

           32.

                         
          While Hazel reads the letter, we see a SERIES OF SCENES
          showing the next several days. They include:
          - Hazel and Gus drinking coffees at a cafe. He's
          enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every
          moment of it.
          - Hazel helping Gus become a better driver. It's no use.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           "I was wondering if you wouldn't
           mind answering a few questions I
           have about what happens after the
           end of the book. Specifically, the

                          FOLLOWING:"
          - In his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           "Does Anna's Mom marry the Dutch
           Tulip Man; is the Dutch Tulip Man
           up to something - or is he just
           misunderstood? What happens to
           Anna's friends?
          - Watching TV. Their bodies almost touching. But not quite.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Lastly, I was hoping you could shed
           some light on Sisyphus the Hamster.
           These questions have haunted me for
           years. And I don't know how long I
           have left to get answers to them."
          And finally, back in Hazel's bedroom. She finishes reading
          this letter into the phone.

                          HAZEL
           "I know these are not important
           literary questions and that your
           book is full of important literary
           questions, but I would just really
           like to know."
          INTERCUT w/ Gus bouncing a ball against the wall, listening.

                          HAZEL
           (reading it aloud to him)
           "And of course, if ever you do
           decide to write anything else, even
           if you don't want to publish it,
           I'd love to read it. Frankly, I'd
           read your grocery lists. Yours with
           great admiration, Hazel Grace
           Lancaster. Age 16."

           Not bad.

           You think?

                          GUS
           Bit pretentious. But then again,
           Van Houten uses words like
           "tendentious" and... "bacchanalia"
           so I think he'll like it.
          Hazel smiles, looks at a clock.

                          HAZEL
           Is it really almost 1?

                          GUS
           Guess so.

                          HAZEL
           I gotta get to sleep.

                          GUS
           Ok...

                          HAZEL
           Ok...
          Neither one of them want to hang up the phone.

           Ok...

                          HAZEL
           Ok...
          They both laugh at this.

                          GUS
           Perhaps "ok" will be our "always."
          Hazel smiles.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.
          Gus hangs up. We stay with Hazel. Is it really possible this
          Beautiful Boy likes her? She thinks about it. She's not
          convinced. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL - RECOVERY ROOM - DAY
          Isaac lies in bed, bandages covering his eyes, now officially

           You'll get over her Isaac. Just
           takes a little time. You'll see.
          The Nurse exits the room.

                          ISAAC
           Is she gone?

                          HAZEL
           Yeah.

                          ISAAC
           Did she really just say "you'll
           see?"

           (shakes her head)
           Qualities of a Good Nurse. Go.

                          ISAAC
           Doesn't pun your disability.

                          HAZEL
           Gets blood on the first try.

                          ISAAC
           That is huge. I mean, seriously, is
           this my freakin' arm or a
           dartboard? Three - no condescending
           voice.

                          HAZEL
           (lays it on thick)
           "I'm gonna stab you with this
           needle now, so there might be a
           little ouchie."
          They laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.

                          HAZEL
           You doing alright, Isaac?

                          ISAAC
           I don't know. To be honest, I think
           a hell of a lot more about Monica
           than my eye. Is that crazy? That's
           crazy.

                          HAZEL
           It's a little crazy.

           35.

                         

                          ISAAC
           But I believe in love, you know? I
           don't believe that everybody gets
           to keep their eyes or not get sick
           or whatever, but everybody should
           have true love. Don't you think?
          Hazel thinks about it as Isaac presses the button on his pain
          pump, self-administering morphine.

                          ISAAC
           Gus was here earlier.

                          HAZEL
           (trying to be nonchalant)
           Was he?
          Isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.

                          ISAAC
           Mmm... that's better.

                          HAZEL
           The pain?
           (off his slow nod)
           Good. Good, Isaac.
           (Isaac closes his eyes)
           What about Gus?
          But Isaac is already asleep. Whatever he was going to say
          about Gus is gone. Hazel nods, pats his hand. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          Hazel rolls out of bed, stumbles to her computer. She
          casually checks her in-box and is shocked to discover - he's
          written her back!

                          HAZEL

           36.

                         
          Frannie races in, clearly expecting a health problem.

                          FRANNIE
           What's wrong?!

                          HAZEL
           (realizing she scared her)
           Nothing. Sorry.

                          FRANNIE

                          (CONFUSED)
           Nothing?

                          HAZEL
           Everything! Look!
          Hazel shows Frannie the note. Frannie reads it.

                          HAZEL
           Can we go to Amsterdam? Please?
          Frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat.

                          FRANNIE
           Hazel, I... I love you and... you
           know I'd do anything for you, but
           we don't...

                          (PAINED)
           We don't have the money. The
           expense of getting equipment over
           there - love, it's just not
           possible...

                          HAZEL

                          (DEFLATES)
           No, yeah, of course.
          Clearly Frannie feels awful. Which makes Hazel feel awful.

                          FRANNIE
           I mean, I could talk to your father

                          OR --

                          HAZEL
           Mom, no. Please. Don't do anything.
           Forget I mentioned it.
          A beat between them. Frannie walks out, sadly. Hazel sits on
          the bed, totally bummed now for two reasons.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Guilt is definitely a side effect
           of cancer.

                         

          EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER
          Hazel and Gus walk together on the sidewalk.

           37.

                         

                          GUS
           Just use your wish.

                          HAZEL
           I've used it already. Pre-
           "Miracle."

                          GUS
           What'd you do?
          Hazel doesn't want to say. Gus realizes.

                          GUS
           Not Disney.

                          HAZEL
           I was 13...

                          GUS
           Tell me you did not go to Disney
           World.
           (Hazel looks away)
           Hazel Grace! You did not use your
           one dying Wish to go to Disney
           World!

                          HAZEL

                          (FEEBLE)
           And Epcot Center.

                          GUS
           (hands in the air)
           Oh my God!

                          HAZEL

                          (DEFENDING HERSELF)
           We had fun on that trip.

                          GUS
           That is the saddest thing I've ever
           heard!

                          HAZEL
           I met Goofy...

                          GUS
           Now I'm embarrassed.

                          HAZEL
           Why are you embarrassed?

                          GUS
           How can I have a crush on a girl
           with such cliche wishes?

                          HAZEL
           Wait, what?
          The word "crush" has taken Hazel totally by surprise.

           38.

                         

                          GUS
           What?
          She looks at him. A beat. She quickly looks away, blushing.
          Gus continues on about Disney but all Hazel can think about
          is "CRUSH". She tries not to seem too excited. CUT TO:

                         

          INT PET SCAN ROOM - DAY
          Hazel, in a hospital gown, is slowly fed through the machine.
          A TECH explains that she should hold still, try and relax,
          etc. But Hazel knows. She knows all about these procedures.
          She's a pro. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - FRONT
          Gus is waiting on the front stoop when Frannie's car pulls
          up. They're home from the hospital.
          He wears an Indiana Pacers JERSEY and carries a bouquet of
          bright orange TULIPS.
          Michael gets out of the passenger's seat to help Hazel out of
          the car. Gus rises to assist them.

                          MICHAEL
           Is that a Rik Smits jersey?

                          GUS
           It is indeed.

                          MICHAEL

                          (BEAT)
           Man, I loved that guy.
          Hazel sees Gus, wasn't expecting him.

                          HAZEL
           Gus?

                          GUS
           Hi Hazel.

                          (BEAT)
           How would you like to go on a
           picnic?

                         

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          Gus is with Frannie and Michael downstairs.

                          FRANNIE
           Something to drink?

                          GUS
           I'm great Mrs. Lancaster.

           39.

                         
          Meanwhile, upstairs, Hazel gets ready for the date. She's put
          the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on
          LIP GLOSS. She can faintly hear the conversation downstairs.
          ANGLE ON Gus sitting on the stairs. Michael next to him.

                          MICHAEL
           You're a survivor yourself?

                          GUS
           (taps his leg)
           Didn't cut this fella off for the
           hell of it. Though it is an
           excellent weight-loss strategy.
           Legs are heavy!

                          MICHAEL
           How's your health now?

                          GUS
           N-E-C for fourteen months.

                          MICHAEL
           That's fantastic.

                          GUS
           I'm very lucky.
          ANGLE ON Hazel, checking herself out in the mirror. Seems to
          like what she sees a lot more than before.
          BACK ON Gus and Michael, downstairs:

                          MICHAEL
           Son, you have to understand...
           Hazel's still pretty sick. She will
           be the rest of her life.
          ANGLE on Hazel, who can hear all of this. She stops what
          she's doing and listens.

                          MICHAEL
           She'll want to keep up with you -
           she's that kind of girl - but the
           truth is, her lungs --

                          HAZEL
           You ready Gus?
          Hazel appears, silencing her Father mid-sentence. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT PARK - LATER
          Behind the Indianapolis Museum of Art is 152 Acres of Gardens
          and Grounds. Hazel and Gus walk together.

                          HAZEL
           Is this where you bring all your
           romantic conquests?

           40.

                         

                          GUS
           Every last one.

                          (BEAT)
           Probably why I'm still a virgin.
          Hazel laughs, elbows him.

                          HAZEL
           You're not a virgin.
           (off his look)
           Are you really?
          Gus picks a STICK up from the dirt. Draws a BIG CIRCLE in it.

                          GUS
           See this? This circle is virgins...
          Now Gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.

                          GUS
           And this... is 17 year old dudes
           with one leg.
          Hazel laughs. Point made. He grabs her hand, helps her walk
          up a tiny hill. Once up there, Gus lays a blanket on the
          ground. They sit, looking out over a rather odd SCULPTURE - a
          set of GIANT WHITE BONES where children can jump and play.

                          GUS

                          (EXPLAINING)
           "Funky Bones" by Joep Van Lieshout.

                          HAZEL
           He sounds Dutch.

                          GUS
           And he is. Much like Rik Smits. And
           tulips.
          Hazel raises an eyebrow at Gus. He's sure taking this
          Amsterdam/Dutch thing pretty far. He removes some sandwiches
          and orange juice out of a basket.

                          GUS
           Sandwich?

                          HAZEL
           Let me guess --

                          GUS

                          (NODS)
           Dutch cheese. And tomato.
           (she takes one)
           The tomatoes are Mexican. Sorry.
          They eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play
          on the bones.

           41.

                         

                          GUS
           How cool is that? A skeleton being
           used as a playground.

                          HAZEL
           You do love your symbols.

                          GUS
           Speaking of which...
          Gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. He
          clears his throat.

                          GUS
           You're probably wondering why
           you're sitting here eating a bad
           cheese sandwich and drinking orange
           juice with a guy in a Rik Smits
           jersey.

                          HAZEL
           It has crossed my mind.

                          GUS
           Hazel Grace, like so many before
           you - and I say this with great
           affection - you spent your Wish...
           moronically.

                          HAZEL
           I was thir--

                          GUS
           Hush! I'm in the midst of a grand
           soliloquy here.

                          HAZEL
           Sorry. Please, continue...

                          GUS
           You were young. Impressionable. The
           Grim Reaper staring you in the
           face. And the fear of dying with
           your one true Wish left ungranted
           led you to rush into making one you
           didn't really want, for how could
           little Hazel Grace, having never
           read "An Imperial Affliction" ever
           know that her one TRUE wish was to
           visit Mr. Peter Van Houten in his
           Amsterdamian exile.
          Hazel nods in agreement.

                          GUS
           If you were smart, you would have
           saved your wish til the time in
           your life when you really knew your
           true self.

           42.

                         
          Gus stops talking. Hazel is confused.

                          HAZEL
           But I... didn't save it.
          Gus smiles.

                          GUS
           Good thing I saved mine.
          Hazel cocks her head to one side. What is he talking about?

                          GUS
           Got it in exchange for the leg.

                          (BEAT)
           And I still have it.
          She starts to realize.

                          HAZEL
           Are you saying --

                          GUS
           I'm not gonna give you my Wish or
           anything. But I too have an
           interest in meeting Peter Van
           Houten and it wouldn't make much
           sense to meet him without the girl
           who introduced me to his book, now
           would it?
           (Hazel's eyes widen)
           I talked to the Genies and they're
           in total agreement.

                          (BEAT)
           We leave on May third.
          Hazel is so excited that she grabs Gus and pulls him into a
          hug. Their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it
          looks like something might happen --

                          HAZEL
           Wait a minute.

                          (BEAT)
           Are you only doing this so I'll
           kiss you?
          A beat. Gus blinks a few times.

                          HAZEL
           Cause I'd totally kiss you either
           way.
          And kiss him she does. He's surprised. And when it's over,
          they sit back, look at one another. A magic moment.

                          HAZEL
           Seriously... why are you doing
           this?

           43.

                         

                          GUS
           Because Hazel Grace... I found my
           Wish.
          And Hazel is beyond touched. We hear:

                          FRANNIE (OVERLAP)
           Are you out of your mind?

                         

          INT HAZEL'S UTILITY ROOM - DAY
          Frannie folds laundry while Hazel pleads her case.

                          FRANNIE
           It's too much, Haze. We can't
           accept something like that from a
           virtual stranger.

                          HAZEL
           He's not a stranger.

                          FRANNIE
           Really?

                          HAZEL
           Don't be gross.

                          FRANNIE
           It's still "no," I'm afraid.

                          HAZEL
           Can we at least ask Dr. Maria?

                         

          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY
          Where Hazel's oncologist DR. MARIA shakes her head.

           DR. MARIA
           That's out of the question.

                          HAZEL
           You said the PET scan was
           encouraging!

           DR. MARIA
           The PET scan is encouraging. We
           just don't know how long it'll stay
           that way. What if you get sick in a
           foreign country?

                          HAZEL
           They have doctors in Amsterdam. And
           cancer. Someone will know what to
           do.

           44.

                         

           DR. MARIA
           Be that as it may, without someone
           familiar with your particular case,
           I can't --

                          HAZEL
           (turns to her Mom)
           So you'll come too.

                          FRANNIE
           What?

                          HAZEL
           The Genies can hook it up. They're
           loaded.

                          FRANNIE

                          I --

                          HAZEL
           You've never been to Amsterdam,
           have you Mom?
          And judging from her face, seems she'd kinda like to. Dr.
          Maria looks at Frannie, shrugs - kid's got a point.
          Hazel smiles. And on that smile, we SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK.
          Over which, we HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           And then this happened.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          [Note: There's no sound in this sequence. Just images.]
          Hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night, shaking
          and holding her head.
          Frannie and Michael burst in. Mom grabs her crying daughter,
          frightened beyond belief, waves to Michael to call for help.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           People talk about the courage of
           cancer patients. And I do not deny
           that courage...
          He leaves the room to do so and Fran stays behind, rocking
          with her daughter, promising her it'll all be ok. Whatever
          nightmare this is, it's going to end. CUT TO:

                         

          INT FRANNIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          Still silent. Michael drives, trying to keep it together.
          Frannie's in the back with Hazel's head in her lap.

           45.

                         
          Hazel continues to scream in silence, whether from pain or
          terror, we do not know.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I'd been poked and stabbed and
           poisoned for years and still I trod
           on.

                         

          INT EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          Michael carries Hazel into the chaotic emergency room.
          They're practically running. There's still no sound.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           But make no mistake...
          The doctors rally to assist the screaming, crying child.
          She's wheeled away from her family who can only watch. We
          stay with her and WE HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           In that moment I would have been
           very, very happy to die.

          END SEQUENCE.

                         

          INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ICU - MORNING
          The sound returns. And it's the sound of a heart monitor.
          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It's also the sound of a working heart.
          Hazel has made it through. Her eyes open. A NURSE is there.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE
           Hello.

                          HAZEL
           Hi.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE
           You're ok, Hazel.
          Even Hazel seems surprised by that.

                          HAZEL'S NURSE
           Would you like to see your parents?
          Hazel nods. The Nurse goes to get them. Soon they come
          bounding in, crying and kissing her repeatedly. So much
          relief. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel's bed has been raised up so she can talk to her
          parents "comfortably."

                          FRANNIE
           They thought it was a brain tumor.

                          MICHAEL
           It wasn't - thank god --

           46.

                         

                          HAZEL
           So what happened?

                          FRANNIE
           The usual. Fluid in the lungs,
           preventing oxygenation. They put
           that in...
          There's a TUBE in Hazel's side draining fluid into a plastic
          bladder that hangs off her bed.

                          FRANNIE
           Drained a liter and a half last
           night.
          (That's a lot of fluid.)

                          MICHAEL
           The good news is... no tumor
           growth. No new tumors in your body.
          Hazel nods. That is a relief.

                          MICHAEL
           We're all so relieved.
          Frannie embraces her daughter.

                          FRANNIE
           This is just a thing Hazel. It's a
           thing we can live with.
          Hazel nods again. Only in the universe of Hazel Grace
          Lancaster is something like this just a thing. Meanwhile:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL ICU - WAITING AREA - LATER
          Here's Gus, his foot tapping nervously on the floor. It's
          unclear how long he's been waiting there. He sees Michael
          walk down the hall. Races after him.

                          GUS
           Mr. Lancaster! How's she doing?

                          MICHAEL
           Better, thank you. Much better.
          Gus nods, as relieved as the rest of them.

                          GUS
           They won't let me in. Family only.

                          MICHAEL
           I'm sorry --

                          GUS
           No I get it. Will you just... will
           you tell her I was here?

           47.

                         

                          MICHAEL
           Of course I will.
          Gus smiles. And sits back down. Though he won't get to see
          her, he still wants to stay.

                          MICHAEL
           Gus.
          Michael really likes this kid.

                          MICHAEL
           Why don't you go home, get some
           rest?
          Gus looks up. That might be for the best. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYS LATER
          Hazel and her Parents sit at a very large conference table
          along with Dr. Maria and THREE OTHER ONCOLOGISTS - her whole
          "Cancer Team."

                          ONCOLOGIST #1
           The great news is... Phalanxifor
           continues to control your tumor
           growth.

                          (BEAT)
           The not so great news is we're
           still seeing serious problems with
           fluid accumulation.

                          (BEAT)
           So how should we proceed?
          Silence. Hazel looks around the room, waits for someone to
          answer. No one does.

                          HAZEL
           Um, I feel like I'm not the most
           qualified person to answer that.

                          ONCOLOGIST #1
           I was talking to Dr. Simmons.
          DR. SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.

           DR. SIMMONS
           It's a strange case. Normally the
           tumors start resisting the
           treatment. But that hasn't happened
           here - yet.
          Hazel hears the "yet" the loudest.

           DR. SIMMONS
           Unfortunately, the drug may be
           worsening the edema.

           48.

                         

           DR. MARIA
           But if we stopped it entirely,
           we're likely to face even graver
           dangers.

                          MICHAEL
           So we're gonna do nothing?

           DR. MARIA
           That's what we have to decide. The
           truth is... very few people have
           been on Phalanxifor as long as
           Hazel has. We don't really know the
           long term effects.
          That comforts no one.

                          HAZEL
           Can't I just get like a lung
           transplant or something?
          The Doctors look at one another like "who wants to take that
          one?" Eventually:

           DR. MARIA
           You would not be considered a...
           strong candidate for a transplant.
          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother
          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a
          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.

           DR. SIMMONS
           We're trying to prevent endothelial
           growth while at the same time
           preventing immunosorbent...
          As Dr. Simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook,
          Hazel's eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents. She hates
          what she's doing to them. And seeing them holding hands,
          crying but trying not to cry - it jogs a memory. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL ICU - FLASHBACK
          We saw this once before. It looks like the end for 13-year
          old Hazel. Her father is weeping off to the side while her
          mom stands over her, holding her hand, and asking:

                          FRANNIE
           (through the tears)
           Are you ready, sweetie?
          13-year old Hazel nods. The doctors get to work. The
          anaesthetic takes hold and Hazel goes under. But not enough.
          Cause she totally hears her mother say:

                          FRANNIE
           I won't be a mom anymore.

           49.

                         
          She falls into her husband's chest. And we're BACK TO:

                         

          INT HOSPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM
          Hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her
          staring at them. She tries to shake it off. Dr. Simmons is
          still talking nonsense when:

                          HAZEL
           I have a question.

           DR. MARIA
           Yes Hazel.

                          HAZEL
           Can I still go to Amsterdam?
          Dr. Simmons can't help himself. He laughs. Everyone looks at
          him. He clears his throat.

           DR. SIMMONS
           That would not be wise at this
           juncture.

                          HAZEL
           Why not?

           DR. SIMMONS
           Excuse me?

                          HAZEL
           Why not, Dr. Simmons?

           DR. SIMMONS

                          I --
          The doctors are trying to be delicate here.

           DR. MARIA
           It would... increase some risks --

                          HAZEL
           So does going to the mall --

           DR. MARIA
           Yes but an airplane?

                          HAZEL
           They have oxygen on airplanes.

                          FRANNIE

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL
           It's my life, right?

           DR. SIMMONS
           You're Stage IV --

           50.

                         

                          HAZEL
           I have this opportunity I may never
           have again. If the medicine's
           working, I don't see why --

           DR. SIMMONS
           Because, Hazel.

                          (BEAT)
           Look, I don't know any other way to
           say this... You're just too sick.
          And this is like a punch in the gut.

           DR. SIMMONS
           I'm sorry.
          Everyone feels horrible now. Dr. Maria, Frannie and Michael,
          and even Hazel. This meeting couldn't have gone worse. And we

                         CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY
          Hazel parent's bring her home from the hospital. She looks
          miserable. It's clear the last few days have been a big
          emotional set back. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER
          Her parents tuck her in.

                          FRANNIE
           We'll be right outside.
          Hazel nods. Her phone buzzes. She looks at it. A text from
          Gus that reads: "ok?" Hazel looks at it.
          And she doesn't write back. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HAZEL'S KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT
          Hazel sits staring at nothing. The house phone rings. Michael
          comes in from another room with the phone in hand. Whispers:

                          MICHAEL
           Gus again.
          Hazel thinks about it - silently shakes her head, no. Michael
          says into the phone.

                          MICHAEL
           I'm sorry Gus, she's asleep.
          Hazel stands and goes into her bedroom, clearly depressed.

           51.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - LATER
          Hazel reads from "An Imperial Affliction." Her phone buzzes
          again. "Augustus." It just says "hello?" Again she ignores
          it.
          And then a second text. She looks at it. "The silence is
          deafening." She puts the phone back down.
          Hazel's heart breaks. She can't take it anymore. She picks
          the phone back up. She texts the following:
          "I don't know if you'll understand this but I can't see you
          anymore. I mean I want to. I just..."
          She thinks about the rest. She writes:
          "I'm a grenade."
          She sends the text. Waits.
          And then there's more to say. She sends a second text.
          "When I look at you, all I can see is what I'm going to put
          you through. I can't have that. I'm sorry."
          She sends that text. Waits.
          He writes back.
          "Ok."
          Hazel reads it. Writes back: "Ok."
          A beat. Gus responds: "oh my god, stop flirting with me!"
          Hazel smiles - she can't help herself! - but she must. She
          gets her emotions in check. Puts the phone away. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING
          An ugly day in Indianapolis.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S HOUSE - SAME
          Inside, Hazel is about as miserable as the weather. The sky -
          and the circumstances - have cast a grey pall over the day.

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD
          Hazel walks out back. Looks up at the clouds, threatening
          rain but not yet delivering it. She sits down in the grass,
          on the verge of tears. She looks at the old rusty SWING SET
          that's been in her backyard for years.

           52.

                         
          And starts to cry. Just for a few brief moments, she lets
          herself cry.
          Then she wipes the tears. Becomes strong again. And makes a
          decision.
          Hazel dials her phone. We hear:

           GUS (O.S.)
           Hazel Grace!

                          HAZEL
           Hi Augustus.

           GUS (O.S.)
           Are you crying, Hazel Grace?

                          HAZEL
           Kind of.

           GUS (O.S.)
           What's the matter?

                          HAZEL
           I don't know. I want to go to
           Amsterdam. And I want him to tell
           us what happens after the book and
           I don't want my particular life and
           also the sky is making me sad and
           there's this old swing set that my
           Dad made for me when I was a kid.
           It's just... everything.
          Hazel is on the verge of losing it again. A few beats of
          silence pass by.

           GUS (O.S.)
           I demand to see this swing set of
           tears.
          Hazel can't help but smile and we CUT TO:
          LATER. Same backyard - only now Hazel is with Gus. Which
          makes everything better.
          They both look at the swing set.

                          GUS
           I see your point.

                          (BEAT)
           That is one sad swing set.
          Hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder.

                          HAZEL
           Thanks for coming over.

           53.

                         

                          GUS
           You do realize... trying to keep
           your distance from me will in no
           way lessen my affection for you.
          Hazel says nothing.

                          GUS
           All efforts to save me from you
           will fail.
          Hazel looks at him. He's sure not making this easy.

                          GUS
           Is this about Amsterdam? Cause we

                          DON'T --

                          HAZEL
           It's not about Amsterdam. It's
           about me. It's about...

                          GUS
           Grenades.
          Hazel nods.

                          GUS
           I get it. One day you're going to
           explode in a huge ball of fire and
           everyone close to you will die in
           your wake.

                          HAZEL
           Exactly.

                          GUS
           There's already two people in your
           life you're going to destroy. Why
           add a third to that list. Am I
           right?

                          HAZEL

                          (NODS)
           That's why I don't have a hamster.
          Gus is silent. He can't argue. They stand there quietly a few
          more beats, looking out at the swing set. Until:

                          GUS
           We have got to do something about
           this frigging swing set.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel sits at the computer screen writing a Craigslist post.
          Gus stands next to her.

           54.

          Gus laughs.

                          HAZEL
           No?
          Gus laughs harder. Hazel laughs with him.

                          GUS
           That's why.
          Hazel looks at him, not understanding.

                          GUS
           In case you were wondering...
           that's why I like you.
           (beat, off her look)
           You're so busy being you that you
           have no idea how utterly
           unprecedented you are.
          Hazel absorbs that. Her feelings for this boy in a tangle.

                         CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD
          Gus and Hazel watch as a TOWNIE finishes loading the swing
          set into the back of his PICK-UP. Gus salutes the swing set
          as the truck drives off.
          Then he sneaks a quick kiss on Hazel's cheek. She shoots him
          a look. Gus throws up his hands.

                          GUS
           Friendly.
          She playfully elbows him away.

                         

          EXT CHURCH - ANOTHER DAY
          Hazel walks with Isaac out of Support Group.

                          ISAAC
           Do you like him?

                          HAZEL
           Of course I like him.

           55.

                         

                          ISAAC
           But you don't want to hook up with
           him?
          Hazel doesn't know what she wants.

                          HAZEL
           It's complicated.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
          Hazel is at her computer reading a new email from Lidewij
          Vliegenthart. Clearly Hazel was not expecting this.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           "Dear Hazel, I have received word
           via the Genies that you will be
           visiting us with Augustus Waters
           and your mother beginning on the
           4th. A week away! Peter and I are
           delighted and cannot wait to --
          Hazel is confused. She stands and walks into the hallway.

                          HAZEL
           Mom?
          No response.

                          HAZEL
           Mom!

                          (STILL NOTHING)

           MOM!!!
          Frannie races out of her room in a towel, dripping wet.

                          FRANNIE
           What is it, what's wrong?!

                          HAZEL
           Sorry, I... I didn't know you were
           in the shower.

                          FRANNIE

                          (EXHAUSTED)
           Bath. I was just... just trying to
           take a bath for five seconds.
           What's the matter?

                          HAZEL
           Did you ever call the Genies to
           tell them the trip is off? I just
           got an email from Peter Van
           Houton's assistant. She still
           thinks we're coming.
          Frannie purses her lips and squints past Hazel. Clearly
          unsure what to say.

           56.

                         

                          HAZEL
           What?
          Frannie can't keep a straight face.

                          FRANNIE
           I'm not supposed to tell you until
           your father gets home.

                          (BEAT)
           We're going to Amsterdam.

                          HAZEL
           (still not believing)
           Really...

                          FRANNIE
           Dr. Maria called last night and
           made a convincing case that you
           need to live --

                          HAZEL

                          (YELLING)

           I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!
          Hazel can't move all that fast to hug her Mom so Frannie
          comes to her and they embrace. After:

                          FRANNIE
           I'm getting back in the tub now.
          When she leaves Hazel grabs her cell phone. ANGLE ON IT.
          Hazel sends Gus the following text: "STILL FREE MAY 3? :-)"
          A moment later Gus responds: "EVERYTHING'S COMING UP WATERS!"
          Hazel is over the moon with excitement. She smiles, then
          tries to calm herself, knowing it's the best thing.

                          HAZEL
           (whispering to her lungs)
           One week, lungs. Keep your shit
           together one more week...

                         

          INT KITCHEN - ONE WEEK LATER
          Luggage waits by the door, including oxygen tanks and medical
          equipment. Frannie makes breakfast as Hazel enters, now
          dressed and excited for the trip.

                          HAZEL
           Amsterdam!

                          FRANNIE
           Amsterdam!
          And a moment later Michael joins them.

           57.

                         

                          MICHAEL
           Amsterdam!
          They're all going crazy with excitement! CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HOUSE - LATER
          Michael finishes loading up the car. Kisses his wife goodbye.
          He embraces Hazel. She hugs him back and of course he starts
          to cry.

                          MICHAEL

                          (WHISPERING)
           I love you. I'm so proud of you.

                          HAZEL
           For what?
          Michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears. They look at
          each other. Unable to help himself, he grabs her for another
          hug. Hazel lets him, laughing.

                         

          INT / EXT CAR - LATER
          The car is packed with oxygen tanks, a suitcase for clothes,
          another for medicines and back-up medicines just in case etc.
          Frannie pulls up to Gus's house. They get out of the car and
          head to the front door, buzzing with excitement.
          As they get close, they can hear a commotion inside. A
          WOMAN'S VOICE yelling something unclear, followed by:

           GUS (O.S.)

           BECAUSE IT'S MY LIFE, MOM. IT

           BELONGS TO ME!
          Frannie immediately puts her arm around Hazel and quickly
          spins her back to the car.

                          HAZEL
           Mom?

                          FRANNIE
           We can't eavesdrop, Hazel.
          Back at the car, far out of earshot, they wait. Hazel unsure
          what that was about. Frannie politely honks the horn.
          A moment later Gus emerges from the house, smiling. A travel
          bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips.

                          GUS

                          (TO FRANNIE)
           Always a pleasure to see you ma'am.

                          (BEAT)
           Hello, Hazel Grace.

           58.

                         

                          HAZEL
           Ok...?

                          GUS
           Ok.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.
          Frannie doesn't know what to make of any of that. She just
          says, when they stop and look at her:

                          FRANNIE
           Amsterdam!

                         

          EXT AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING
          A SKYCAP helps Hazel, Gus and Frannie with all their bags and
          equipment.

                         

          INT AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
          They wait in line for the security checkpoint. When it's
          Hazel's turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose.
          Gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt.
          Hazel takes slow, careful steps through the metal detector.
          She seems determined to get through this without any help.
          But upon reaching the other side it's clear that even these
          few steps without oxygen were a struggle.
          Hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady
          herself. As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula
          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and
          focuses on her breathing. She catches her mom looking at her,
          nervously.

                          HAZEL
           (with some difficulty)
           Amsterdam!

                         

          INT AIRPORT GATE - LATER
          Arriving at the Gate area they draw curious looks from the
          OTHER PASSENGERS: Hazel with her oxygen tank, Gus with his
          noticeable limp and Frannie helping with the equipment.
          A YOUNG COUPLE gets up so that Hazel and Gus can sit.

                          HAZEL
           Oh that's not necessary.
          But they give up their seats anyway. Hazel and Gus take them.
          We see various Passengers watching. Hazel ignores the
          attention until a LITTLE GIRL (6, cute braids) appears.

           59.

                         

                          LITTLE GIRL
           What's in your nose?

                          HAZEL
           It's called a Cannula. These tubes
           give me oxygen and help me breathe.
          The GIRL'S MOTHER swoops in, a little frantic.

                          GIRL'S MOTHER
           Jackie... Oh, I'm sorry.

                          HAZEL

                          (SINCERE)
           No, no. It's alright.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Would they help me breathe too?

                          HAZEL
           I dunno. Wanna try?
          Hazel removes her cannula and let's the Little Girl try it.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Tickles.

                          HAZEL
           Right?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I think I'm breathing better.

                          HAZEL
           Well... I'd love to give you my
           cannula but... I kinda really need
           the help.
          The Little Girl nods, hands it back to Hazel, who quickly
          reattaches it.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Thanks for letting me try it.
          They smile at each other before the Little Girl walks back to
          her family. She waves. Hazel waves back.

           AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENT (O.S.)
           We will now begin pre-boarding
           Flight 144 to Amsterdam. For those
           passengers in need of extra
           assistance...

                          HAZEL
           I think that's us.

           60.

                         

          INT AIRPLANE - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel sits in the middle with Frannie on the aisle and Gus at
          the window. He looks around, antsy.

                          HAZEL
           Have you never been on a plane
           before?
          Gus shakes his head, he has not. And he's nervous. He pulls a
          cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. Within
          seconds a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rushes over.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
           Sir, you can't smoke on this plane.
           Or... any plane.

                          GUS
           (cigarette in his mouth)
           I don't smoke.
          The Flight Attendant shoots him a look.

                          HAZEL
           It's a metaphor. He puts the
           killing thing in his mouth but
           doesn't give it the power to kill
           him.

                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT

                          (NO NONSENSE)
           That metaphor is prohibited on
           today's flight.
          Gus nods and puts the cigarette away.

                          PA SYSTEM
           "Flight attendants, prepare for
           departure."
          The engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards
          take off. Gus is getting more worried by the second. He grabs
          the arm rest, his eyes wide.

                          HAZEL
           Ok?
          Gus doesn't say it back. Hazel laughs.

                          HAZEL
           This is what it feels like to ride
           in a car with you.
          Gus grabs Hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. He looks out
          the window - they're flying! - and then back to Hazel.

                          GUS
           We're flying! Look!
          Hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.

           61.

                         

                          GUS
           Holy -- look at that?! NOTHING HAS

           EVER LOOKED LIKE THAT EVER IN ALL

           OF HUMAN HISTORY!
          He's adorable at this moment. Hazel can't resist leaning over
          to give him a kiss on the cheek.

                          FRANNIE
           (not looking up from her

                          MAGAZINE)
           Just so you know, I'm right here.
           Sitting next to you. Your mother.

                          HAZEL
           We're just friends, Mom.

                          GUS
           She is. I'm not.
          Hazel shoots him a look. Gus shrugs - "what, it's the truth."
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
          LATER. Mid-flight, the plane is dark, Frannie's asleep. Hazel
          and Gus watch the same gory action movie. Actually, he
          watches the movie. She just watches him watch it. He watches
          it with gusto.
          Hazel continues to watch him. Try as she might, she's falling
          in love. CUT TO:
          SFX: the PLANE touching down. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT/ INT AMSTERDAM HIGHWAY - TAXI CAB - MORNING
          Hazel, Gus, and Frannie ride in the back of a YELLOW CAB.

                          CAB DRIVER
           Americans?

                          FRANNIE
           We're from Indiana.

                          CAB DRIVER
           Indiana. They steal from the
           Indians but the keep the name, yes?
          Hazel and Gus share a look.

                          HAZEL
           Something like that.
          Meanwhile, the landscape outside is flat and dusty, with dirt
          tracks and the occasional concrete building. In other words,
          it looks more like Indianapolis than Holland.

                          HAZEL
           (to the Driver)
           This is Amsterdam?

           62.

                         

                          CAB DRIVER
           Yes and no. Amsterdam is like the
           rings of a tree. It gets older as
           you get closer to the center.
          Soon enough, the cab takes an off-ramp and turns a corner and
          suddenly, it's as if they're transported - not only to
          another universe but to another time as well.
          We see MULTI-COLORED ROW HOUSES lined on both sides of a
          windy CANAL. HOUSEBOATS float against the edges and everyone
          rides BICYCLES down cobblestone streets. They're astounded.

                         

          INT HOTEL - LATER
          Gus helps Hazel and Frannie bring their stuff into the room.
          We see a WICKER BASKET of gifts - presents from the Genies -
          welcoming their arrival. Hazel, exhausted, sits on the bed.

                          GUS
           I'll be right down the hall.
          Hazel nods, already drifting off to sleep. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOTEL ROOM - HOURS LATER
          Some time later. Hazel stirs. Her Mom is seated in a sagging,
          paisley CHAIR across from the bed reading a TRAVEL GUIDE.

                          HAZEL
           Good morning.

                          FRANNIE
           Actually, it's five o'clock.

                          HAZEL
           How was the park?

                          FRANNIE
           Never made it.

                          HAZEL
           Mom!

                          FRANNIE
           What? I like watching you sleep.
          Hazel shoots Frannie a look. Even in an exotic city, her Mom
          still can't enjoy herself.

                          FRANNIE
           I promise I'll do crazy Mom stuff
           tonight while you and Gus are at
           dinner.

                          HAZEL
           What do you mean?

           63.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           You have reservations at a place
           called Oranjee. Mr. Van Houten set
           it up. Very fancy according to the
           Book. And romantic.

                          HAZEL
           Mom...

                          FRANNIE
           I'm just saying...

                          HAZEL
           A 16 year old girl running free
           with an older boy on the streets of
           a foreign city famous for its vice
           and debauchery... is totally cool
           with you. Is that what you're
           saying?

                          FRANNIE
           (beat, excited)
           Let's get you dressed!
          Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER
          Frannie opens the door to find Gus in a perfectly tailored
          BLACK SUIT, cigarette dangling from his mouth.

                          FRANNIE
           (calling to the bathroom)
           Hazel! Gus is here.

                          (TO GUS)
           Looking sharp.

                          GUS
           Thank you ma'am.
          A few beats later Hazel emerges from the bathroom. She wears
          a knee-length, pale blue SUNDRESS. And she looks...

                          GUS
           Wow.

                          HAZEL

           I...

                          (BEAT)
           Am I under-dressed?

                          GUS
           You look gorgeous.
          Gus offers Hazel his arm. She takes it. They're ready to go.

           64.

                         

          INT/EXT AMSTERDAM - ON THE TRAM - LATER
          Hazel and Gus ride the crowded tram through the city. ELM
          TREES line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the
          wind like a spring snowstorm.
          An OLD COUPLE stands to give up their seats - this happens
          all the time. Hazel again tries to protest and again it falls
          on deaf ears. She and Gus sit. They look out the window onto
          the city. Excited. The night just beginning.

                         

          EXT ORANJEE RESTAURANT - LATER
          At the edge of the canal, near an ancient bridge. Hazel and
          Gus are shown to a TABLE right next to the water.

                          HOSTESS
           Your table, Mr. And Mrs. Waters.
          Gus pulls out Hazel's chair for her. A WAITER brings them a
          bottle of CHAMPAGNE as they sit.

                          HOSTESS
           The champagne is our gift.
          Hazel and Gus look at each other. Is this a dream? The
          champagne is poured and Gus raises his glass.

                          GUS
           Ok.
          Hazel raises hers.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.
          They clink glasses and sip.

                          HAZEL
           Wow that's good.

                          WAITER
           Do you know what Dom Perignon said
           after he invented champagne?

                          (BEAT)
           `Come quickly,' he said. `I am
           tasting the stars!'
          Hazel and Gus smile.

                          WAITER
           Welcome to Oranjee. Would you like
           a menu or will you have the chef's
           choice?
          Gus looks at Hazel. She shrugs.

           65.

                         

                          GUS
           The chef's choice sounds lovely.
           (the Waiter nods)
           And can we get more of this?

                          WAITER
           We have bottled all the stars for
           you this evening, my young friends.
          The Waiter leaves. Hazel and Gus look at each other.

                          GUS
           Thank you for coming to Amsterdam.

                          HAZEL
           Thank you for letting me hijack
           your wish.

                          GUS
           Thank you for wearing that dress
           which is like whoa.
          Hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to.
          The Waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:

                          WAITER
           Belgian white asparagus with a
           lavender infusion.
          Hazel takes a bite.

                          HAZEL
           Oh my god.

                          GUS
           Yeah?
          Gus takes a bite.

                          HAZEL
           I mean...

                          GUS
           That is just...

                          HAZEL
           There are no words.
          Meanwhile, down on the water a BOAT passes, filled with
          merry, drinking LOCALS. One of them raises a glass to them
          and says something in Dutch.

                          GUS

                          (SHOUTING BACK)
           We don't speak Dutch!

                          ANOTHER LOCAL
           She says, "the beautiful couple is
           beautiful!"

           66.

                         
          Hazel and Gus smile. This night could not be going any better
          so far. CUT TO:
          LATER. Hazel and Gus enjoying their second courses.

                          GUS
           I want this dragon carrot risotto
           to become a person so I can take it
           to Vegas and marry it.
          Hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.

                          HAZEL
           I like your suit.

                          GUS
           Thanks. First time wearing it.

                          HAZEL
           That isn't the suit you wear to
           funerals?

                          GUS
           Oh no. That one's not nearly this
           nice.
           (off her look)
           When I first found out I was sick -
           I mean, they told me I had like an
           85% chance to be cancer-free. Great
           odds, sure. But that meant a year
           of torture, the loss of my leg, and
           still a 15% chance it might fail.

                          (BEAT)
           So right before the surgery I asked
           my parents if I could buy a suit,
           like a really nice suit, just in
           case I didn't make it.

                          HAZEL
           It's your death suit.

                          GUS
           That's what it is.

                          HAZEL
           I have one of those. Bought it for
           my 15th birthday. Don't think I'd
           wear it on a date, though.

                          GUS
           Are we on a date?

                          HAZEL
           (cocks her head)
           Watch it.
          Gus winks. CUT TO:
          LATER. Dessert on the table. As they euphorically eat:

           67.

                         

                          GUS
           God?

                          HAZEL
           Maybe.

                          GUS
           Angels?

                          HAZEL
           Undecided.

                          GUS
           Afterlife?

                          HAZEL
           No. Well...

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe I wouldn't go so far as to
           say no. I just... I'd like some
           evidence.

                          (GUS NODS)
           What do you think?

                          GUS
           Absolutely.

                          HAZEL
           Really?

                          GUS
           Oh for sure. I mean, not like a
           heaven where you ride unicorns,
           play harps, and live in a mansion
           made of clouds but, yeah, I believe
           in something.
          Hazel is surprised.

                          GUS
           Something becomes of us. It has to.
           Otherwise what's the point?

                          HAZEL
           Maybe there is no point.

                          GUS
           I refuse to accept that.

                          (BEAT)
           I won't accept it.
          Hazel thinks about it. She appreciates his conviction but is
          still not sure she agrees. The hand they've been dealt too
          unfair. Hazel looks out at the water as she says:

                          HAZEL
           I hope you're right.

                          GUS
           I'm in love with you.

           68.

                         
          That gets her attention.

                          GUS
           You heard me.

                          HAZEL

                          AUGUSTUS --

                          GUS
           I'm in love with you. And I know
           that love is just a shout into the
           void, and that oblivion is
           inevitable, and that we're all
           doomed and that there will come a
           day when all our labor has been
           returned to dust, and I know the
           sun will swallow the only earth
           we'll ever have, and I am in love
           with you.
           (shrugs, matter-of-fact)
           Sorry.
          At which point, the Waiter reappears.

                          WAITER
           More stars?
          Hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on
          Gus. Eventually Gus answers for them.

                          GUS
           Just the check, please.

                          WAITER
           No, sir.

                          (BEAT)
           Your meal has been paid for by Mr.
           Van Houten.
          Gus raises his eyebrows at Hazel. This Van Houten guy is
          something else.

                         

          EXT AMSTERDAM CANALS - LATER
          Hazel and Gus on a park bench, his arm around her, looking
          out over the water. Seeds blow from the elm trees and the
          reflections of the city ripple in the water below them.
          Hazel leans into his body, just a little. They stay like
          that, savoring the best night of both of their lives. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT AMSTERDAM - HOTEL - ESTABLISHING
          A crisp Spring morning in Amsterdam. The buzz in the air
          outside is equalled by the buzz in:

           69.

                         

          INT HOTEL ROOM - SAME
          Where Hazel excitedly paces through the room.

                          FRANNIE
           I really don't get that shirt.
          Hazel wears a screen print t-shirt of Magritte's "Ceci N'est
          Pas Une Pipe." (A painting of a pipe with words below that
          mean "This is not a pipe.")

                          HAZEL
           Van Houten will get it. Trust me.
           There are like fifty Magritte
           references in "Imperial
           Affliction."

                          FRANNIE

                          (READING)
           "This is not a pipe."

                          HAZEL
           Exactly.

                          FRANNIE
           But it is a pipe.

                          HAZEL
           No it's not. It's a drawing of a
           pipe. See?

                          (SHE DOESN'T)
           All representations of a thing are
           inherently abstract. A drawing of a
           thing is not the thing itself. Nor
           is a t-shirt of a drawing of a
           thing the thing itself.
          Frannie is still at a loss but she's impressed.

                          FRANNIE
           When did you get so grown up? I
           feel like it was yesterday I was
           telling 8-year old Hazel why the
           sky was blue. You thought I was a
           genius back then.

                          HAZEL
           Why is the sky blue?

                          FRANNIE

                          (BEAT)
           Because I say so.
          A knock on the door. Gus pokes his head in.

                          GUS
           Who's ready for some answers!

           70.

                         

          EXT. VONDELSTRAAT ROW HOUSES - LATER

          Gus and Hazel stand outside Van Houten's white house.

                          HAZEL
           I'm so excited I can barely
           breathe.

                          GUS
           As opposed to other days...?
          She playfully hits him. He takes her arm, picks up the oxygen
          tank, and up they go towards his front door.
          As they approach, there's a noticeable NOISE coming from
          inside the house. It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.
          Like, obnoxiously loud.
          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait. There's
          no response.

                          GUS
           Maybe he can't hear over the music?
          Gus tries again, this time with more force. Still nothing. He
          tries a third time. Finally, the music stops. They wait.
          Still excited.
          A moment later the door swings open.
          It's a MAN IN PAJAMAS (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning
          hair, and a week-old beard. All he says is:

           MAN IN PAJAMAS
           What?!
          Gus and Hazel look to one another. Could it be?

                          GUS
           Mr. Van Houten?
          At which point, the Pajama Man slams the door in their faces.
          Hazel and Gus are too stunned to react. Through the closed
          door, they hear this:

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)

                          (SHOUTING)

           LEEE-DUH-VIGH!

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Are they here, Peter?
          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN. Gus and Hazel can't believe it.

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
           There are two --

                          (BEAT)
           Who the hell's "they?"

           71.

                         

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           They are Augustus and Hazel, the
           young fans with whom you've been
           corresponding.
          Gus and Hazel smile at hearing their names. Perhaps this will
          help things take a turn for the better.

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
           The Americans?

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           You invited them, remember?

           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)
           You know why I left America,
           Lidewij? To never have to encounter
           Americans. Get rid of them.
          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!

           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.
          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose
          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ
          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves
          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.
          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,
          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Which of you is Augustus Waters?
          Gus raises his hand tentatively.
          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and
          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Please. I am sorry. Come in.
          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes
          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:

                         

          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME
          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile
          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single
          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.
          Van Houten sits in the chair.
          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and
          twist-tied.

                          HAZEL
           Trash?

           72.

                         

                          LIDEWIJ
           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never
           opens it.
          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his
          slippers. He motions for them to sit on the couch.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Yours are the first missives to
           which I've replied and look where
           that got me.
          Hazel and Gus take their seats.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Scotch?

                          HAZEL
           Um, no thanks.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Augustus Waters?

                          GUS
           It's 11am.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Just me then, Lidewij. Scotch and
           soda.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Perhaps some breakfast first Peter?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           She thinks I have a drinking
           problem.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I also think the Earth is round.
          Nevertheless, Lidewij pours Peter half a glass and hands it
          to him. He takes a sip, then sits up straight.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           So you like my book.

                          HAZEL
           Yes. We - well, Augustus, he made
           meeting you his Wish so that we
           could come here and talk to you.
          Van Houten says nothing. Takes a long pull on his drink.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Did you dress like her on purpose?

                          HAZEL
           (looks at her shirt)
           Kinda.

           73.

                         
          Van Houten says nothing to that.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I do not have a drinking problem. I
           have a Churchillian relationship
           with alcohol: I can crack jokes and
           govern England and do anything I
           want to do. Except not drink.
          He glances over at Lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.

                          GUS
           Incidentally, thank you for dinner
           last night.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (TO LIDEWIJ)
           We bought them dinner last night?

                          LIDEWIJ
           It was our pleasure.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (SIGHS)
           You've come a long way so... what
           is it I can do for you?

                          HAZEL
           We have some questions --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Uh-huh...

                          HAZEL
           About what happens, you know...
           after... the end of your book.
           Specifically to those who Anna
           leaves behind. Like her Mom, the
           Dutch Tulip Man, Sisy --

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (INTERRUPTING)
           How familiar are you with Swedish
           hip-hop?
          Hazel looks at Gus. Is he kidding?

                          HAZEL
           I would say... limited?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           But presumably you know Afasi Och
           Filthy's seminal album "Flacken."

                          GUS
           Um...

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Lidewij! Play `Bomfalleralla'
           immediately.

           74.

                         
          Lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. A few seconds
          later, some loud Swedish rap song blasts from the speakers.
          Hazel and Gus sit through this, totally baffled.

                          HAZEL
           (yelling over the music)
           I'm sorry, sir. We don't speak
           Swedish.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (YELLING)
           Who the hell speaks Swedish? The
           important thing is not what
           nonsense the voices are saying, but
           what the voices are feeling.
          The song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before
          Gus has enough. He gets up and turns off the music.

                          GUS
           Are you messing with us?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Pardon?

                          GUS
           Is this some kind of performance?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Rudolf Otto said that if you had
           not encountered the numinous then
           his work was not for you. And I say
           to you, my friends, if you cannot
           hear Afasi Och Filthy's bravadic
           response to fearfulness, then my
           work is not for you.
          Hazel is really getting worried at this point. They came all
          this way for this?

                          HAZEL
           So anyway... when the book ends,
           Anna's mom --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           (raising a hand to silence

                          HER)
           Let us imagine that you are racing
           a tortoise.
          Hazel and Gus fidget in their seats. Lidewij frowns, clearly
          feeling bad for them. Van Houten continues.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           The tortoise has a ten yard head
           start. In the time it takes you to
           run ten yards, the tortoise has
           moved maybe one yard. And so on,
           forever.

                          (MORE)

           75.

           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
           You are faster than the tortoise
           but you can never catch him, you
           see, you can only decrease his
           lead. Now certainly you can run
           past the tortoise as long as you
           don't contemplate the mechanics
           involved but the question of how
           turns out to be so complicated that
           no one really solved it until
           Cantor's proof that some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities.
          Hazel and Gus have no idea how to respond.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I assume that answers your
           questions.

                          GUS

                          (TO HAZEL)
           I don't know what's going on.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           And yet you seemed so intelligent
           in print, Mr. Waters.
           (under his breath)
           Must be all that cancer in your
           brain.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Peter!
          Gus could throw a punch right now. Hazel tries to calm the
          situation.

                          HAZEL
           Can we please, maybe, talk about
           Anna for a sec? I mean, I
           understand that the story ends mid-
           sentence because she dies or she
           becomes too sick to continue --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I'm not interested in talking about
           that book.

                          HAZEL
           - but that doesn't mean her family
           and everyone she loves doesn't have
           a future, right?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I said I'm not interested --

                          HAZEL

                          (GETTING UPSET)
           But you promised!

                          (CALMS HERSELF)

                          (MORE)

           76.

                          HAZEL (CONT'D)
           Mr. Van Houten, you said you would
           tell us what happens and that's why
           we're here. We... I need you tell
           me. Surely you've thought about it.
           I mean, as characters --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Nothing happens to them! They're
           fictions. They cease to exist the
           moment the novel is over.
          This is not what Hazel came all this way to hear. She won't
          accept it.

                          HAZEL
           They can't!
           (again, has to calm

                          HERSELF)
           I mean, I understand. In a literary
           sense. But it's impossible NOT to
           imagine some future --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I can't do this. Lidewij, get rid
           of them, please.
           (Lidewij doesn't move, he
           turns back to Hazel)
           I won't indulge your childish
           whims. I refuse to pity you in the
           manner in which you're accustomed.

                          HAZEL
           I don't want your pity --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Of course you do. Like all sick
           kids, your existence depends on it.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Peter!

                          VAN HOUTEN
           (on a roll)
           You are fated to live out your days
           as the child you were when
           diagnosed, the child who believes
           there is life after a novel ends.
           And we, as adults, we pity this, so
           we pay for your treatments, for
           your oxygen machines. We give you
           food and water though you are
           unlikely to live long enough --

                          LIDEWIJ

           PETER!

                          VAN HOUTEN
           You are a side effect of an
           evolutionary process that cares
           little for individual lives.

           VAN HOUTEN (CONT'D)
           You are a failed experiment in
           mutation.

                          LIDEWIJ

           I RESIGN!
          Lidewij has tears in her eyes. Gus has balled his fists. But
          not Hazel. Van Houten's words have not phased her one bit.
          She rises from the couch.

                          HAZEL
           Hey listen douchepants. You're not
           gonna tell me anything I don't
           already know about illness. I need
           one thing and one thing only from
           you before I walk out of your life
           and that's for you to tell me what
           happens to your goddman characters!

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (BEAT)
           I cannot tell you.

                          HAZEL
           Bullshit!

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I cannot --
          Van Houten goes to take a drink but...

                          HAZEL
           Make something up.
          ... Hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands,
          surprising everyone.
          After a beat:

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Lidewij. I'll have a martini
           please.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I have resigned.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Oh don't be ridiculous.
          No one moves. Van Houten realizes he's alone in this.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I'd like you to leave now.

                          HAZEL
           You're really not gonna tell us?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I would like you... to leave.

           78.

                         
          Hazel is furious. Gus stands next to her, touches her arm is
          if to say "come on, enough of this guy." CUT TO:

                         

          EXT VAN HOUTEN'S HOUSE - SAME
          Gus and Hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. As
          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Have you ever stopped to ask why
           you care so much about your silly
           questions?
          A beat.

                          HAZEL
           Go fuck yourself.
          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the
          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.

                          GUS
           Hey. It's ok. It's ok...
           (beat, an idea)
           I'll write you a sequel.
           (she cries harder)
           I will. Better than any shit that
           drunk could write. With blood and
           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.
          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus
          gives her a hug. Afterwards:

                          HAZEL
           I spent your Wish on that asshole.

                          GUS
           You did not spend it on him. You
           spent it on us.
          They embrace once more.

                          HAZEL
           I wanted...

                          GUS
           I know... I know. Apparently the
           world is not a wish-granting
           factory.
          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes
          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made
           him cruel. I thought meeting you
           would help him, if he would see
           that his work has shaped real
           lives, but... I'm very sorry.

           79.

                         
          Hazel says nothing. Gus holds her in a very protective way.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Perhaps we can do some sightseeing.
           Have you seen the Anne Frank House?

                          GUS
           I'm not going anywhere with that
           monster.

                          LIDEWIJ
           He is not invited.

                         

          EXT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - LATER
          Lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I'm afraid there's no elevator.

                          HAZEL
           Oh, um, that's alright.

                          LIDEWIJ
           No, there are many stairs. Steep
           stairs.

                          HAZEL
           I can do it.

                          GUS

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL
           I can do it!
          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments
          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:

                         

          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of
          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of
          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of
          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.

                          LIDEWIJ
           Shall we?
          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So
          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.

                          LIDEWIJ
           This is the bookcase that hid the
           Frank family and four others.
          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set
          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.

           80.

                         
          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks
          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the
          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen
          tank.
          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored
          breathing the entire time.
          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.
          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.
          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's
          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall
          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.

                          GUS
           You're a champion.
          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the
          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more
          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this
          he looks at Hazel:

                          GUS
           That's enough --

                          HAZEL

                          (RESOLUTE)
           I'm ok.
          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her
          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.
          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull
          herself through.
          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the
          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.

                          GUS
           We're at the top. That's it.
          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.
          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.
          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.
          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding
          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing
          their story.

                          LIDEWIJ
           The only member of the whole family
           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.
          Gus takes Hazel's hand.

                          LIDEWIJ
           I don't know how you go on, without
           your family.

           81.

                         
          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads
          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO
          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear
          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.
          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the
          same. The room is dark.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "At such moment's, I don't think
           about the misery..."
          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the
          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "...but about the beauty that still
           remains."
          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she
          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.
          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...

           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
           "Try to recapture the happiness
           within yourself. Think of all the
           beauty in everything around you...
           and be happy."
          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-
          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've
          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a
          small eternity.
          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly
          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,
          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...
          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the
          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts "bravo!" Hazel blushes,
          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:

                         

          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the
          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:

                          GUS
           It's above my knee.
          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.

                          GUS
           It tapers a little and then it's
           just skin --

                          HAZEL
           What?

           82.

                         
          Hazel pulls away from him.

                          GUS
           My leg.

                          (BEAT)
           Just so you're prepared --

                          HAZEL
           Oh get over yourself.
          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off
          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure
          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They
          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical
          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:

                          HAZEL
           I love you, Augustus Waters.

                          GUS
           I love you too, Hazel Grace.
          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:

                         

          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she
          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.
          It reads: "Dearest Augustus..."
          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled "Virgins." And in that
          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled "17 year old dudes
          with one leg." We'll notice part of that circle is now
          outside the bigger circle. Gus flashes that signature smile.

                         

          EXT CAFE - DAY
          Hazel and Gus sit with Frannie drinking coffee in the sun at
          an outdoor cafe. They're re-enacting yesterday's events.

                          HAZEL
           "Get up you fat bastard."

                          GUS
           "I can't stand up, I'm too drunk."

                          HAZEL
           I said "get up."

                          GUS
           "Standing is for fools!"

                          HAZEL
           God, what an asshole.
          They both giggle at the whole thing.

           83.

                         

                          HAZEL
           It was awful, Mom. You can't
           imagine.

                          FRANNIE
           And then what happened?

                          HAZEL
           Then we went to the Anne Frank
           museum.

                          FRANNIE
           And after that?
          A quick glance between Hazel and Gus.

                          HAZEL
           We just... walked around.
          Hazel and Gus smile, thoroughly in love but trying to keep it
          in check in front of her Mother.

                          FRANNIE
           Sounds lovely.
          A few beats later.

                          FRANNIE
           Listen... I'm gonna stretch my legs
           a little. Give the two of you some
           time to talk.

                          HAZEL

                          (THAT'S WEIRD)
           Um... ok...
          As she stands up to leave, Hazel thinks she catches Gus and
          Frannie making eye contact for a brief second. Once Frannie
          has left them:

                          HAZEL
           That was weird.
          Gus doesn't respond except to say:

                          GUS
           Shall we?

                         

          EXT AMSTERDAM STREET - LATER
          They start to walk. Gus takes a cigarette out of his pack,
          sticks it between his lips. Hazel notices he's struggling
          with something.

                          HAZEL
           Augustus?

           84.

                         

                          GUS
           There's something I have to tell
           you...
          They walk in silence a few beats.

                          GUS
           Just before you went into the
           hospital... There was this... I
           felt this... ache in my hip.
          Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.

                          HAZEL
           Oh no...
          Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth
          tightly, trying not to cry.

                          GUS
           I had a PET scan.
          Gus sits down on a BENCH. Looks up at her. Tries to smile.
          Before he even says it, she knows.

                          GUS
           It lit up like a Christmas tree,
           Hazel...

                          HAZEL
           Oh god.

                          GUS
           The lining of my chest, my liver...
           everywhere.

                          HAZEL
           Oh my god no!
          Hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging
          him for dear life, her head in his lap.

                          HAZEL
           I'm so sorry, Augustus. I'm so so

                          SORRY --

                          GUS
           I'm sorry too --

                          HAZEL
           It's so unfair --

                          GUS
           I should have told you --

                          HAZEL
           It's so fucking unfair!
          A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.

           85.

                         

                          GUS
           Apparently the world is... not a
           wish-granting factory.
          And at that point, Gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be
          sad and feel awful.
          But just for a second. Then he shakes it off, pulls Hazel's
          face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.

                          GUS
           Don't you worry about me, Hazel
           Grace. I'll find a way to hang
           around and annoy you for a long
           time.
          She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.

                          HAZEL
           Does it hurt?

                          GUS
           It's ok.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm ok.

                          HAZEL
           Ok.

                          GUS
           Ok.
          But of course it's not ok. Not by a mile.
          Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.

                          GUS
           What?

                          HAZEL
           I'm just... I'm very fond of you.
          He grabs her hand and holds it.

                          GUS
           I don't suppose you can forget
           about it, treat me like I'm not
           dying.

                          HAZEL
           I don't think you're dying,
           Augustus. You've just got a touch
           of cancer.
          Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.

                          GUS
           Would it be absolutely ludicrous to
           make out right now?

           86.

                         
          Hazel doesn't answer. She just kisses him, hard. And on the
          two of them, so in love, we CUT TO:

                         

          INT AIRPLANE - LATER
          Hazel lays on Gus's shoulder as he stares out the window,
          leaving Amsterdam behind.

                         

          INT INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY
          As they ride down the escalator, Hazel sees Michael standing
          amongst the livery drivers. He holds a sign that says -
          instead of someone's last name - "My Beautiful Family (and
          Gus)."
          Upon seeing them, he immediately starts to cry of course. He
          kisses his wife, gives Hazel a big hug. Gus goes to shake his
          hand but Michael hugs him as well. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
          Hazel sits with her father on the couch.

                          HAZEL
           Gus had a recurrence.

                          MICHAEL

                          (NODS)
           Mrs. Waters told us the night
           before you left.

                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry Hazel.
          They sit for a beat. Tears form in Michael's eyes.

                          HAZEL
           You're not gonna say it?

                          MICHAEL
           What's that?

                          HAZEL
           The usual. "Everything happens for
           a reason..."
          Michael shakes his head.

                          MICHAEL
           I don't know, Haze.

                          (BEAT)
           I always thought being an adult
           meant knowing what you believe...

                          (BEAT)
           ... that has not been my

          INT GUS'S BASEMENT BEDROOM - DAY
          Gus lays in bed, eyes open, a PICC line now being fed through
          a port in his chest. Chemotherapy at work.
          Hazel and Isaac are keeping him company.

                          HAZEL
           How are your eyes?

                          ISAAC
           Great. Wonderful. I mean, they're
           not in my head is the only problem.

                          GUS
           I hate to one-up you but... seems
           my entire body is made out of
           cancer now, so...
          Isaac nods. Tries not to get emotional but it's happening. He
          goes to touch Gus's arm and accidentally touches his thigh.

                          GUS
           Whoa, I'm taken.
          Isaac laughs.

                          ISAAC
           (to Hazel, re: Gus)
           Did you write his eulogy yet?
          Hazel is confused.

                          GUS
           Dude.

                          ISAAC
           What?

                          GUS
           I haven't asked her.

          Gus looks at her, grows a little serious.

                          GUS
           I need speakers at my funeral. I
           thought maybe you and Isaac... but
           especially you --

                          ISAAC
           Hey!

                          GUS
           Would you be kind enough to whip
           something up?

                          HAZEL
           (touches his hand)
           It would be an honor.
          They hold holds.

                          ISAAC
           You guys are adorable.
          Hazel play slaps Isaac on the arm.

                          HAZEL
           How's your love life? Anything from
           Monica?

                          ISAAC
           Not a word.

                          HAZEL
           She hasn't even like, texted to ask
           how you're doing?
          He shakes his head. Gus gets an angry look on his face.

                          HAZEL
           That is so messed up!

                          ISAAC
           I've stopped thinking about it.
           Moving on. There's a new girl in
           Support Group with these humongous -
          Isaac gestures to his chest. Hazel is confused.

                          HAZEL
           How do you even know that?

                          ISAAC
           I'm blind but I'm not that blind.

                          GUS
           Hazel Grace!
          They turn to him.

                          GUS
           Do you happen to have four dollars?

          INT HAZEL'S CAR - LATER
          Gus is in the passenger's seat. Isaac sits in the back. Hazel
          returns to the car. With a CARTON OF EGGS.

           Ok now what?
          Gus smiles. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel, Gus, and Isaac lean against Hazel's car staring
          something down.

                          ISAAC
           Is it there?

                          GUS
           Oh it's there.
          REVEAL they're looking at Monica's green Firebird.

                          ISAAC
           She's in the house?

                          GUS
           Who cares where she is? This is not
           about her. This is about you.
           (sticks out his hand)
           Hazel...
          Hazel nods, opens the egg carton, hands Gus an egg. Gus puts
          it in Isaac's hands. Positions Isaac - who, of course, can't
          see a thing - towards the Firebird.
          Isaac winds up and tosses the EGG.
          It misses the car by a mile. After a beat:

                          ISAAC
           I didn't hear anything.

                          GUS
           A little to the left.

                          ISAAC
           My throw was to the left or I
           should aim to the left?

                          GUS
           Aim left.
          Isaac turns his shoulders.

           90.

                         

                          GUS
           Lefter.
          Isaac turns some more.

                          GUS
           Yes! Excellent! And throw hard.
          Gus hands him a SECOND EGG. Isaac winds up and hurls it -
          missing the car again but hitting the HOUSE.

                          GUS
           Bullseye!

                          ISAAC
           Really?

                          GUS
           No you missed it by like 20 feet.
           (hands him a THIRD)
           Try one more time.
          Isaac hurls it, this time smashing the car's taillight.
          Isaac's face lights up.

                          HAZEL
           Woo hoo!
          Isaac grabs for ANOTHER EGG. Throws it. Then ANOTHER. He's a
          throwing machine. Most of them miss but at least he's
          enjoying himself. Finally there's a DIRECT HIT on the car
          door, triggering the alarm. Isaac pauses.

                          GUS
           Keep throwing, keep throwing!
          Isaac does. Gus smiles, putting an unlit cigarette in his
          mouth. Hazel watches him, enjoying this moment.
          Eventually, MONICA'S MOM opens the front door and comes out.

                          MONICA'S MOM
           What in God's name --
          Seeing Hazel, Gus, and Isaac, she stops in her tracks.

                          GUS
           Are you Monica's mom?

                          MONICA'S MOM

                          (CONFUSED)
           I am.

                          GUS
           Hello ma'am. Your daughter has done
           an injustice and we've come here
           seeking revenge. We may not look
           like much. Between the three of us,
           we have five legs, four eyes, and
           two and a half working lungs.

                          GUS (CONT'D)
           But we also have two dozen eggs. So
           If I was you, I would go back
           inside.
          Monica's Mom is very confused. A beat. Without another word,
          she turns and goes back inside. The three of them celebrate.
          As Isaac picks up where he left off, Hazel gently kisses Gus
          on the cheek. And over we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           A few days later, Gus landed in the
           hospital with chest pains.

                         

          INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
          Hazel bounds in to find Mrs. Waters in the waiting room. She
          stands to hug Hazel. They both sit down.

                          HAZEL
           How's he doing?

           MRS. WATERS
           He's had a tough night, Hazel. His
           blood pressure's low. His heart --
          Mrs. Waters starts to cry.

                          HAZEL
           What about the chemo?

           MRS. WATERS
           (shakes her head)
           They're gonna stop the chemo.
          They both know what that means. Mrs. Waters gathers herself.

                          HAZEL
           Can I see him?

           MRS. WATERS

                          (BEAT)
           We have to be a family now.
          Hazel nods. She understands.

           MRS. WATERS
           We'll tell him you were here.

                          HAZEL
           If you don't mind, I'll just hang
           for a while.
          Mrs. Waters nods, hugs her again, walks out through the heavy
          doors towards Gus's room. Hazel sits in the chair. Same chair
          Gus sat in while waiting for her. They've switched places.

           92.

                         

          EXT INDIANAPOLIS MUSEUM OF ART - DAY
          Hazel pushes Gus, now confined to a WHEELCHAIR, to their spot
          on the hill overlooking "Funky Bones." A second picnic, this
          time with champagne. Hazel pours some for them both into
          little Winnie the Pooh cups. She's trying to be upbeat - but
          it's difficult. Gus watches the kids play on the bones.

                          HAZEL
           What are you thinking about?

                          GUS

           I know it's kid's stuff but... I
           always thought I'd have a grand
           story to tell, you know? Something
           that would run in all the papers. I
           always thought I was special.

                          HAZEL
           You are.

                          GUS
           Yeah but... you know what I mean.
          Hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. Gus
          can tell he's said something wrong.

                          GUS
           What?

                          HAZEL
           I do know what you mean, I just...
           I don't agree.
          Hazel stands up, anger building.

           meaningful life is for everyone to
           love you, for everyone to remember
           you. Well guess what, Gus, this is
           your life. This is all you get. You
           get me, and your family, and this
           world. And if that's not enough,
           well I'm sorry, but it's not
           nothing. Cause I'll remember you,

           (pulling her back down)
           I'm sorry.
          Gus hands Hazel another Winnie the Pooh cup. Raises his to

                          GUS
           It's a good life, Hazel Grace.
          She softens. They toast.

                          HAZEL
           It's not over yet, you know.
          Gus nods. Of course it isn't. And yet they both know there
          isn't much time. CUT TO:

          Hazel is asleep. Suddenly, her phone buzzes. She looks at it -
          "Gus" - then she looks at the clock - 2:35am. A pit grows in
          her stomach. A quick panicked beat before she answers:

                          HAZEL

                          (RELIEVED)
           Oh, thank God. Hi. Hi, I love you!

           GUS (O.S.)
           I'm at the gas station --

           94.

                         

                          HAZEL
           What?

           GUS (O.S.)
           Something's wrong. You gotta...
           please come help me.

                         

          INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
          Hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually
          finding herself at the Speedway gas station.
          Gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next
          to it. She gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door,
          and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and
          blood. She gags from the smell.

                          GUS

                          (MUMBLING)
           Hi.
          Hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to
          his belly. She sees something is leaking from the TUBE
          sticking out of it.

                          HAZEL

                          (PANICKED)
           Oh, God, Augustus, I'm calling 911.

                          GUS
           No! Please! Hazel, listen to me. Do
           not call 911 or my parents -- I'll
           never forgive you -- Don't, please.
          Gus starts to cry.

                          GUS
           Please just look at it.
          Hazel lifts up his shirt. His ABDOMEN is bright red.

                          HAZEL
           I think it's infected...
          Hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.

                          HAZEL
           Gus, what the -- why are you here?
           Why aren't you home?
          Gus throws up. He doesn't even have the energy to turn his
          mouth away from his lap.

                          HAZEL
           Oh, sweetie...

                          GUS
           I wanted to buy some cigarettes. I
           lost my pack. Or they took it.

                          (MORE)

           95.

                          GUS (CONT'D)
           I don't know. They said they'd get
           me another one but I wanted... to
           do it myself. Do one little thing
           myself.
          Hazel doesn't know what to do.

                          HAZEL
           I can't fix this. I have to call
           someone. I'm sorry.

                          GUS
           No, Hazel, please!
          But she must. She gets out her cell phone and dials. At which
          point, Gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying
          teenage boy that he is. As Hazel dials, we hear:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I wish I could say Augustus Waters
           kept his sense of humor till the
           end, did not for a moment waiver in
           his courage and his spirit soared
           like an eagle to the sky...

                          GUS
           (to himself, shaking)
           I hate myself I hate myself I hate
           this I hate this...

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ...but that is not what happened.
          LATER. An EMT loads Gus into the back of an AMBULANCE. Hazel
          is allowed to ride with him in the back. As the car starts
          moving, Gus grabs her hand.

                          GUS
           Read me something.

                          HAZEL
           Read you something?

                          GUS
           Do you know any poems?

                          HAZEL
           I know one.

                          GUS
           Read it to me.

                          HAZEL
           "The Red Wheelbarrow" by William
           Carlos Williams.
           (beat, tries to remember)
           "So much depends / upon / a red
           wheel / barrow / glazed with rain /
           water / beside the white /
           chickens."

           96.

                         

                          GUS

                          (BEAT)
           Is that it?
          That is it. But there's another ten minutes of driving to do.
          Hazel thinks fast.

                          HAZEL
           No of course not. Um... what
           else...

                          (THINKS)
           so much depends/ upon a blue sky/
           cut open by the branches/ of the
           trees./ So much depends/ on the
           transparent G-tube/ erupting from
           the belly/ of the blue-lipped boy.
          Gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. Hazel cradles his head
          in her arms. And continues...

                          HAZEL
           So much depends upon this observer/
           of the universe...
          As Gus is drifting off to sleep, WE HEAR:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           One of the less bull-shitty
           conventions of the cancer genre is
           the convention known as the "Last
           Good Day..."

                         

          EXT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
          Gus comes home from the hospital. He does not look good - but
          he lives. Hazel is there to help get him inside.

                         

          INT GUS'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
          Gus no longer sleeps in his basement. Nor does he sleep in
          his own bed. He sleeps in a HOSPITAL BED set up in a guest
          room. Hazel is with him. They're watching sports on TV.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           This is where the victim of cancer
           finds himself unexpectedly with
           some hours...

                         

          EXT GUS'S BACKYARD PORCH - ANOTHER DAY
          Hazel and Gus getting some fresh air. She sits there reading
          a book. Gus just sits there. His eyes staring off into
          nothing. Hazel waves to him. Gus looks over, as if waking
          from a dream. She manages a smile. He manages one back.

           97.

                         

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... when it seems like the
           inexorable decline has suddenly
           plateaued, when the pain is for a
           minute bearable.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
          Hazel sits at dinner with her parents. She is barely touching
          her food.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           The problem, of course, is that
           there's no way of knowing that your
           last good day is your "Last Good
           Day." At the time, it's just
           another decent day.
          The phone buzzes and Hazel answers it.

                          HAZEL
           Hi, Augustus.

           GUS (O.S.)
           Good evening, Hazel Grace.
          His voice is strong today, and Hazel is happy to hear it.

           GUS (O.S.)
           Quick question for you. Did you
           ever write that eulogy I asked you
           to prepare?

                          HAZEL
           I may have...

                          GUS
           Excellent. Do you think you could
           find yourself at the Literal Heart
           of Jesus in 20 minutes.

                          HAZEL
           Um... sure. Is everything --

           GUS (O.S.)
           I love you Hazel.
          The call ends. Hazel, confused, stands to go.

                          HAZEL
           I gotta go.

                          FRANNIE
           Finish eating first.

                          HAZEL
           I can't, I have to meet Gus.

           98.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           You haven't eaten a thing.

                          HAZEL
           I'm not hungry.

                          FRANNIE
           You can't not eat, Hazel.

                          HAZEL
           I am aggressively unhungry, ok?

                          MICHAEL

                          HAZEL --

                          HAZEL
           I have to go.

                          FRANNIE
           Sit down.

                          HAZEL
           No!

                          MICHAEL
           Hazel, listen to your mother.
          Hazel tries to push past her but Frannie grabs her shoulders.

                          FRANNIE
           You have to eat, Hazel. You're not
           gonna starve yourself to death just
           because Gus is sick. You have to
           stay healthy --

                          HAZEL
           I can't! I can't stay healthy
           because I'm not healthy, Mom. I am
           dying. I am going to die and leave
           you here alone and you won't have
           me to hover around and you won't be
           a mother anymore, and I'm sorry,
           but I can't do anything about it,
           ok?! Just leave me alone!
          Upon seeing her mother's face change, Hazel immediately
          regrets this.

                          FRANNIE
           You heard me?
          Frannie has tears in her eyes. Hazel looks away, feeling
          terrible.

                          FRANNIE
           You heard me say that to your
           father?
          Frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter.

           99.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           Oh god, sweetie. I'm sorry. I was
           wrong, ok? It wasn't true. It's not
           something I believe.
          Michael sits across from them.

                          FRANNIE
           As long as either of us is alive, I
           will be your mother. Even if you
           die, I --

                          HAZEL
           When.

                          FRANNIE
           Even when you die, I will still be
           your mother. I will always be your
           Mother.
          By now Michael is crying too. They all are.

                          HAZEL
           I worry that you won't have a life.
           That you'll sit around all day with
           no me to look after and stare at
           the walls and be miserable or off
           yourselves or something.

                          FRANNIE
           We're not gonna off ourselves. It's
           gonna hurt like hell to lose you

                          BUT --

                          MICHAEL
           Hazel. You of all people know it's
           possible to live with pain.
          She takes that in. It rings true to her. Hazel nods.

                          FRANNIE
           I don't just sit around, you know.
          Hazel is confused. Frannie looks at Michael like, "should I
          say something?" She goes for it.

                          FRANNIE
           I'm taking some classes. Online. To
           get my master's in social work.

                          HAZEL
           You are?
          Hazel is stunned.

                          HAZEL
           So when you're waiting for me
           outside Support Group or whatever,
           you're always --

           100.

                         

                          FRANNIE
           Working or reading. If I get my
           MSW, I can council families in
           crisis or lead groups dealing with

                          ILLNESS --

                          HAZEL
           Why didn't you tell me?
          Frannie and Michael don't quite know what to say.

                          MICHAEL
           We didn't want you to feel

                          ABANDONED --

                          HAZEL
           Are you kidding? Mom, this is
           awesome! This is fantastic! Oh my
           god!
          Hazel grabs her Mom for a hug.

                          HAZEL
           I'm so excited! You're gonna be so
           great, Mom!

                          FRANNIE
           Thank you. That means everything to
           me.
          Mom and Daughter hug. And when it's over:

                          FRANNIE
           I'd still really like you to eat.

                          HAZEL
           I know Mom. And I will. I promise.
           But right now... I really gotta go.

                         

          INT CHURCH - LATER
          Hazel enters the Literal Heart of Jesus room which is now
          empty except for Isaac, up on a dais, and Gus, in his
          wheelchair. Gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner
          than any young man should be. But for now, he's happy.

                          GUS
           Hazel Grace, you look ravishing.

                          HAZEL
           I know, right?

                          (BEAT)
           So, um, what's going on guys?

                          ISAAC
           You're late.

                          HAZEL
           Late for what exactly?

           101.

                         
          Gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.

                          GUS
           I wanted to attend my funeral. By
           the way, will you speak at my
           funeral?
          Hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses
          him on the mouth.

                          GUS
           Sweet. I'm hopeful I'll get to
           attend as a ghost, but just to make
           sure, I thought I'd - well, not to
           put you on the spot, but I thought
           I'd arrange a pre-funeral.

                          HAZEL
           Why now?

                          GUS
           No time like the present.

                          HAZEL
           (looks around the room)
           How did you even get in here?

                          GUS
           Would you believe they leave the
           door open at night?

                          HAZEL
           Um, no.

                          GUS
           As well you shouldn't.
          He smiles and for a brief moment it's old Gus. Hazel laughs.
          Isaac clears his throat.

                          ISAAC
           "Augustus Waters was a self-
           aggrandizing bastard. But we
           forgive him. We forgive him... not
           because he had a heart as
           figuratively good as his actual one
           sucked, or because he got 18 years
           when he should have gotten more."

                          ISAAC
           I'm assuming you've got some time,
           you interrupting bastard! I mean
           seriously...
           (back to the speech)
           "Augustus Waters talked so much
           that he'd interrupt you at his own
           funeral. And he was pretentious.

                          ISAAC (CONT'D)
           Sweet Jesus that kid never took a
           piss without pondering the
           resonances of human waste
           production. And he was vain. But
           that comes with superhuman
           handsomeness."
          Gus nods - that part is true.

                          ISAAC
           "But I will say this: when the
           scientists of the future show up at
           my house with robot eyes and they
           tell me to try them on, I will tell
           the scientists to piss off, because
           I don't even want to see a world
           without Augustus Waters."
          Hazel smiles - but it's one that triggers an immediate
          emotional waterfall.

                          ISAAC
           "And then, of course, having made
           my rhetorical point, I will put my
           robot eyes on because, I mean...
           robot eyes!"
          Gus has a big smile on his face.

                          ISAAC
           "So anyway, Augustus, my friend...
           Godspeed."
          Gus nods a couple times.

                          GUS
           Thank you Isaac.
          This causes Isaac to lose it. He clings to the lectern.

                          ISAAC
           Goddamn it, Gus.

                          GUS
           Hey don't swear in the Literal
           Heart of Jesus.

                          ISAAC
           Shit! Ass! Balls!
          Isaac sighs. Wipes away the tears. And another beat passes.

                          ISAAC
           Can I get a hand here, Hazel?
          Hazel remembers Isaac can't see. She rises, goes up to get
          him, walks him back to her seat.

                          GUS
           Hazel Grace, it's down to you.

           103.

                         
          Hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. Takes
          a beat to ready herself.

                          HAZEL
           "Augustus Waters was the great star-
           crossed love of my life. Ours was
           an epic love story, and I won't be
           able to get more than a sentence
           into it without disappearing into a
           puddle of tears.

                          (BEAT)
           Like all real love stories - ours
           will die with us, as it should. I'd
           hoped that he'd be eulogizing me,
           because there's no one I'd rather
           have..."
          And that's all she can get out before falling apart. She lets
          it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.

                          HAZEL
           (beat, composing herself)
           "I can't talk about our love story
           so instead I will talk about math.
           I am not a mathematician, but I
           know this: there are infinite
           numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1
           And .12 And .112 And an infinite
           collection of others. Of course,
           there is a bigger infinite set of
           numbers between 0 and 2, or between
           0 and a million. Some infinities
           are bigger than other infinities. A
           writer we used to like taught us
           that. I want more numbers than I'm
           likely to get, and God, I want more
           numbers for Augustus Waters than he
           got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot
           tell you how thankful I am for our
           little infinity. You gave me a
           forever within the numbered days,
           and for that I am eternally
           grateful. I love you."
          Gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. CUT TO:

           BLACK.
          Over which we hear a RINGING TELEPHONE.

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          Hazel turns on the LIGHT by her bed. Her HOUSE PHONE is
          ringing and it's 4am.
          She knows instantly.

           104.

                         

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Augustus Waters died eight days
           later in the ICU...
          Hazel's head falls into her chest.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           ... when the cancer, which was made
           of him, stopped his heart, which
           was also made of him.
          Her bedroom door opens. It's Frannie and Michael. This only
          confirms her worst fears. She starts to cry. Her parents
          embrace her in the bed.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           It was unbearable. The whole thing.
           Every second worse than the last.

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SAME
          Hazel sits in the car in the dark. She's blaring the loudest
          music she can possibly blare - a means of drowning out the
          horrors of the world. Over which we hear this:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           One of the first things they ask
           you in the ER is to rate your pain
           on a scale from 1 to 10. I'd been
           asked this question hundreds of
           times and I remember once, early
           on, when I couldn't catch my breath
           and it felt like my chest was on
           fire, and the nurse asked me to
           rate the pain and though I couldn't
           speak, I held up 9 fingers.
          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.
          She falls apart nonetheless.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           Later on, when I'd been feeling
           better, the nurse came in and she
           called me a fighter. "You know how
           I know," she said. "Because you
           called a ten a nine."

                         

          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING
          Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           But that wasn't the truth. The
           reason I called it a nine was... I
           was saving my ten.

           105.

                         

          INT CHURCH - DAY
          The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.
          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,
          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters
          family and extend their deepest condolences.

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           And this was it. The great and
           terrible ten.
          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.

           MRS. WATERS
           He loved you so much.
          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.

                          HAZEL
           He loved you so much too.
          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in
          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's
          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep
          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.
          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.
          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches
          herself.

                          HAZEL
           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.
          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.
          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights
          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of
          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.

                          MINISTER
           I think we're ready to begin.
          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in
          the middle of the room.

                          MINISTER
           Augustus Waters fought hard for
           many years. His battle was a
           courageous one and his strength was
           a source of inspiration for each
           and every one of us...
          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:

                          MALE VOICE
           What a load of shit, eh kid?
          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She
          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.

           106.

                         

                          MINISTER
           Let us pray.
          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps
          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           We need to fake pray now.
          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns
          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected
          appearance.

                          MINISTER
           Now I call on Augustus's close
           friend Isaac to say a few words.
          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.
          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really
          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.

                          ISAAC
           Of all the things I've lost in my
           life, this hurts the most.
          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or
          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister
          walks back up.

                          MINISTER
           And now we'll hear from Gus's...
           special friend Hazel Lancaster.
          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the
          room at the words "special friend."

                          HAZEL
           I was his girlfriend.
          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.

                          HAZEL
           There's a beautiful quote in Gus's
           home that reads "if you want the
           rainbow, you gotta deal with the
           rain."
          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:

           HAZEL (V.O.)
           I didn't believe a word, of course.
           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd
           decided, aren't for the dead.
           They're for the living.
          Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:

           107.

                         

          EXT CEMETARY - DAY
          Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.
          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.
          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the
          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:
          LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.

                          HAZEL
           I'll be fine.

                          FRANNIE
           Are you sure? We can drive you --

                          HAZEL
           No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for
           a while.
          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.
          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Could I hitch a ride?
          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Just to the bottom of the hill.
          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:

                          HAZEL
           How did you even --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           The internet.

                          HAZEL
           And you just... bought a ticket?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           The drinks are free drinks in First
           Class.
          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a
          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Omnis Cellula e cellula.
          Hazel ignores him.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Your boy Waters and I corresponded
           quite a bit in his last --

                          HAZEL
           You read your fan mail now?

           108.

                         

                          VAN HOUTEN
           I would hardly call him a fan. He
           despised me. But he was quite
           insistent I attend his funeral and
           tell you what became of Anna and
           her mother. So here I am and that's
           your answer: omnis cellula e
           cellula.

                          HAZEL
           I'm so not in the mood --

                          VAN HOUTEN
           "Life comes from life."

                          HAZEL
           Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           You don't want an explanation?

                          HAZEL
           Nope. Thanks though. Have a great
           life.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           You remind me of her.

                          HAZEL

                          (BEAT)
           I remind a lot of people of a lot
           of people.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           She was eight, my daughter. She
           suffered... beautifully. For so
           long.
          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.

                          HAZEL
           She had leukemia? Like Anna?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Just like her, yes.

                          HAZEL
           Were you married then?

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Not when she died, no. I was
           insufferable long before Anna, my
           dear. Grief doesn't change you,
           Hazel, it reveals you.
          Hazel takes that in.

                          HAZEL
           Well I'm sorry for your loss.

           109.

                         

                          VAN HOUTEN
           And I'm sorry for yours. I'm sorry
           for everything, for being so rude
           to you two, for ruining your trip --

                          HAZEL
           You didn't ruin our trip, you
           asshole. We had an awesome trip.

                          VAN HOUTEN
           Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You
           asked me to tell you what happens
           and I wish I could do that. I wish
           that I could. But I can't. No one
           can. No one knows, Hazel. They
           don't talk to us. Unless...
          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to
          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.

                          HAZEL
           You think I care about that? I
           don't give a shit, Van Houten.
          Hazel throws the piece of paper at Van Houten.

                          HAZEL
           You're a drunk and a jerk and a
           failure. And I'd like you to get
           out of my car right now so I can go
           home and grieve.

                          VAN HOUTEN

                          (STUNNED)

                          BUT --

                          HAZEL
           Get out of the car!
          Van Houten knows he's too late. He does as he's told,
          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands
          there as Hazel peels out.
          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if
          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives. CUT TO:

                         

          INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
          Hazel lies in front of the TV. "Top Model" is playing but
          she's lost in her own world. Tears fall from her eyes and she
          can't do anything to stop it. Hazel gets up.

                         

          INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. Soon
          there's a knock.

           110.

                         

                          HAZEL

                          (THROUGH TEARS)
           Occupada.

           MICHAEL (O.S.)
           Can I come in?
          Hazel leans over and unlocks the door. Michael kneels down
          next to her, putting her head on his shoulder.
          Hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more.
          Michael squeezes her tightly. And this time, he doesn't cry.

                          MICHAEL
           I'm so so sorry.

                          (BEAT)
           It was a privilege to love him,
           though, wasn't it?
          Hazel nods into his shirt. Then looks up at her Dad.

                          MICHAEL
           Gives you an idea how we feel about
           you.
          Michael smiles at Hazel. And he doesn't cry. Hazel draws
          strength from him.

                         

          EXT ISAAC'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          Hazel and Isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window.
          They sit on the roof.

                          ISAAC
           Do you know if it hurt or whatever?

                          HAZEL
           He was really fighting for breath,
           I guess. He eventually went
           unconscious, but it seems like,
           yeah, it wasn't great or anything.
           Dying sucks.

                          ISAAC

                          (LONG BEAT)
           It just seems so impossible.

                          HAZEL
           Happens all the time.

                          ISAAC
           Are you angry?

                          HAZEL
           Very.

           111.

                         

                          ISAAC
           Me too.
           (a few beats)
           Gus really loved you, you know.

                          HAZEL
           I know.

                          ISAAC
           He wouldn't shut up about it.

                          HAZEL
           I know.

                          ISAAC
           It was annoying.

                          HAZEL
           I didn't find it that annoying.
          They sit there in silence a few beats.

                          ISAAC
           Did you read the note or whatever
           from your author friend?

                          HAZEL
           He is not my friend and -- how do
           you know about that?

                          ISAAC
           We talked at the cemetery. Said he
           came all this way to give you that.

                          HAZEL
           Yeah well I'm over it. I never want
           to read another word of that
           asshole's again.

                          ISAAC
           Yeah but he didn't write it - Gus
           did.

                          HAZEL

                          (STUNNED)
           What?

                          ISAAC
           That's what he said. Gus had
           written something, sent it to Van

                          HOUTEN --
          Hazel sits up. Her heart is racing.

                          ISAAC
           What?

                          HAZEL
           I... I have to go. I... Are you...?

           112.

                         

                          ISAAC
           I do it all the time. Go.
          As quickly as possible Hazel leaves. Isaac stays behind,
          enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.

                         

          INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY
          Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash
          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to
          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath
          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and
          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:

                          GUS'S VOICE
           Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person
           but a shitty writer. You're a
           shitty person but a good writer.
           We'd make a good team. I don't want
           to ask you any favors but if you
           have the time, and from what I saw
           you have plenty, please fix this
           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.
          Hazel is overcome with emotion.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           She asked me to write one and I'm
           trying, I just, I could use a
           little flair. See the thing is...
           we all want to be remembered.
          She smiles to herself, remembering:
          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.
          - The staring contest in Support Group.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           We all want to leave a mark.
          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.
          - Their first kiss at the picnic by "Funky Bones."

                          GUS'S VOICE
           But not Hazel. Hazel is different.
           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't
           want a million admirers, she just
           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe
           she wasn't loved widely but she was
           loved deeply. And isn't that more
           than most of us get?
          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           When Hazel was sick, I knew I was
           dying. But I didn't want to say so.

           113.

                         

          INT ICU - FLASHBACK
          Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.
          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           She was in ICU and I snuck in for
           ten minutes and sat with her before
           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,
           her lungs were intubated...

          Gus takes her hand and holds it.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           ... but her hands were still her
           hands, still warm, and the nails
           painted this dark blue back color
           and I just held her hands and I
           willed myself to imagine a world
           without us and what a worthless
           world that would be.
          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that
          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:

                         

          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER
          Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen
          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and
          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           She's so beautiful. You don't get
           tired of looking at her. You never
           worry if she's smarter than you
           cause you know she is. She's funny
           without ever being mean.

                         SHE REMEMBERS:
          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.
          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.
          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.
          - Falling onto the bed together.

          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the
          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we
          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make
          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as
          beautiful - because they're real.]

                          GUS'S VOICE
           I love her, god I love her. I'm so
           lucky to love her, Van Houten.

                          (MORE)

           114.

           GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           You don't get to choose if you get
           hurt in this world but you do have
           a say in who hurts you.

          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her
          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           I like my choices. I hope she likes
           hers.

          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.

                          GUS'S VOICE
           Ok, Hazel Grace?

          A beat. Another.
          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:

                          HAZEL
           Ok.

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)

				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a

				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

						CAPTAIN
				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

				Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

				go through the main ventilation!

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

				...'Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

						CORNELIUS
					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS
					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN
					(sighing)
				Finger's gonna kill me...

62	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS
					(with a start)
				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						KORBEN
				Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(suspicious)
				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN
				5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin...

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about

				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID
				Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

				Good philosophy..see good in bad..

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

					(relieved)
				And the Stones?  Did you find them in the
				wreckage?

						MUNRO
				The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

						PRESIDENT
					(surprised)
				...What do you mean?

	The President is all ears.

	So is Zorg's Right Arm.

						MUNRO
				The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the
				human race..they felt we're too unpredictable..
				so they gave up the Stones to somebody they
				do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a Diva
				and she's going to sing at the charity ball on
				Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.  She has the
				Stones with her.

	The President breathes easier.

	Zorg's Right Arm is delighted.

						PRESIDENT
					(taking off a shoe)
				Excellent!

	The President crushes the cockroach with his shoe.

	Right Arm's earphones fly off his head. Good-bye eardrums.

109	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
				I want your best man on this!

						MUNRO
				Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

110	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

						THAI
				Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						KORBEN
				...Hello?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in
				this stinking City!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking
				about?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						KORBEN
				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS
					(weakly, to Loc Rhod)
				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your
				poor mother with your own hands!

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				I want maximum security.

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king

					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

179	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.
Speakers appear.

180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS
				...My God!

184	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

						CAPTAIN
				Commander, I have a ship with a main
				malfunction. He requests permission to
				dock for repairs.

						COMMANDER
				Did you check out his registration number?

						CAPTAIN
				Everything's in order.

						COMMANDER
				Put him in the docking garage and inform
				the police.

185	INT.  COCKPIT  ZFX200 - NIGHT

						CAPTAIN (V.O.)
				Permission granted. Dock 575.  You have
				an hour. Will that be enough time'?

	Zorg sits at the controls.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				More than enough.

186	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

187	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO
				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

						KORBEN
				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

218	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo???

219	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE - CEILING

	Leeloo in bleeding all over.  She can barely move.

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				Kor... ban...

220	EXT.  NEAR FHLOSTON

	The ZFX 200 speeds back toward Fhloston Paradise.

221	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The bomb timer now reads 10 minutes.

222	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY - FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the
station and shoot at anything that tries to enter.  Korben joins the
policemen already there.

						COP 1
				Hey, who are you?

						KORBEN
				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

						KORBEN
				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

						COP
				What's he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

						LOC RHOD
				He's on vacation.

						KORBEN
					(reloading)
				We got to find the leader. Mangalores
				don't fight without a leader.

223	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

						AKANIT
				One more shot and we start killing
				hostages, got that?

224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY

						KORBEN
				Found him...

						AKANIT
					(tense)
				Send someone to negotiate!

						KORBEN
				Mind if I go? I'm an excellent
				negotiator.

						COP 1
				Uh... Sure, go ahead.

	Korben gets ready.

						COP 1
				We're sending someone in who's
				authorized to negotiate.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his
gun and puts a bullet through his head.

						KORBEN
				Anyone else want to negotiate?

						COP 2
					(to another Cop)
				Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

226	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				From us!

	The President gives Munro a hard look.

227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

	The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach
the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1.

						POLICEMAN
				More trouble?

						ZORG
				Nothing I can't fix myself.

	He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

229	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles.  He looks
everywhere, but finds nothing.

230	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo lies in a pool of blood.  She hears something below her.

231	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face
with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it
				explodes.

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

	A general alarm goes off.  Loc Rhod is crushed.

232	INT.  MAIN  HALL

	The lights flicker.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons
				the hotel must be evacuated. Please proceed
				calmly to the lifeboats located in the main

	A wave of panic engulfs the hall.  The cops are unable to hold back the
crowd as it stampedes to the exits.

233	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg marches down the corridor shooting everyone in his path.

234	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Loc Rhod stands paralyzed in front of the flashing timer.  Less than two
minutes left.

						LOC RHOD
				Maybe we oughta be going,
				what do you think?

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

236	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg prefers closing his eyes.  Munro's shoulders move as
if he were beating on Zorg.

237	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN
				We're outta here!

	He picks Leeloo up in his arms.

	Cornelius grabs Loc Rhod and gives him a resounding slap.

						LOC RHOD
				Are you nuts, Father? That hurts! I
				can't feel my teeth.

						CORNELIUS
				Doesn't matter all you need are your
				legs.

						KORBEN
				Anyone know how to release the lines
				on this crate?

244	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Zorg is busy with the ZF1 when the bomb starts to BEEP signaling the last
ten seconds.  Zorg is terror stricken.  He pushes a button and holds the
ZF1 over his head.

						ZORG
					(loudly)
				Maximum Protection.

	A mauve-colored magnetic shield closes around Zorg like an indestructible
	sarcophagus.

245	INT.  ZFX200  COCKPIT

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod are bent over the buttons looking for a way to
release the lines.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				6... 5...

						KORBEN
				Found it?

	Loc Rhod searches frantically.

						LOC RHOD
				I don't even know what I'm looking for!

						KORBEN
				Fuck it! Hold tight!

	Korben slams the throttle into full forward.  The ship roars away ripping
the lines to shreds.

	Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

	CUT TO:

	The counter goes 1... 0

	-The suite disintegrates - The corridor is consumed.

	-The main hall is no more.

246	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The ZFX200 jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it.

247	INT.  ZFX200

	The ship stops shaking.  That was a close one.  Everyone's relieved.

						KORBEN
				Solid little jobs, aren't they?

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, exhausted)
				Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and
				kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the
				news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				Beep. End of transmission.

	Loc Rhod lets out a huge sigh.

						LOC RHOD
					(to the others)
				The best show I ever did!

248	EXT.  PLANET  FHLOSTON

	A magnetic sarcophagus crosses the Fhloston sky and crashes into a
glacier.

249	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	Zorg appears in the middle of the ice.  He takes a portable phone out of
the ZF1.

						ZORG
				How's that? Can you hear me better
				now?

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly!
				So, how was the concert?

						ZORG
				Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to
				listen to music! Listen up instead of
				running off at the mouth!
				The batteries on my phone are almost gone.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Yes, Sir!

						ZORG
				Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately.
				Someone stole mine.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to
				the hotel.

						ZORG
				I'm not at the hotel!

						ZORG
				Hello?...

						BEEPER (O.S.)
				Battery dead.

	Zorg is all alone, lost, in the middle of the glacier.

						ZORG
					(to himself)
				Stay calm.... stay calm...

250	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	General Munro enters the office with a smile.

						MUNRO
				Major Dallas has the Five Elements on
				board. The priest is guiding them directly
				to the temple.

	President Lindberg closes his eyes in relief.

						PRESIDENT
				Thank God! We've been saved!

	A SCIENTIST rushes in.

						SCIENTIST
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				Yes? Now, what?

251	EXT.  SPACE

	A ball of fire, all-powerful Evil, speeds across the screen with three
Federal Army warships following along behind it as best they can.

252	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
				What do you mean, "its advancing"?!

253	INT.  COCKPIT  FEDERATED  WARSHIP

						COMMANDER
				It's not only advancing, but it's moving at
				incredible speed! We're having trouble
				following it.

254	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
					(to Scientist)
				...And... Do you have any idea where it's
				heading?

	The scientist is hard to put to answer, he shakes his head.

255	INT.  ZFX200  COCKPIT - NIGHT

	Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a
little.

						KORBEN
					(gentle, loving)
				Apipoulai..

	Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish.

						LEELOO
				I'm so very sad.

						KORBEN
				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't
				you say?

						LEELOO
				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

						KORBEN
				I told you not to read all that crap!

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

						CORNELIUS
				There's a General on the phone...
				His name's Mambo, I think.

256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				Munro here. President Lindberg wants
				to talk to you.  Hold the line.

	The President clears his throat and takes the phone.

						PRESIDENT
				Major, first off, I want to thank you,
				in my name and in the name of the
				Federation...

257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				For the praiseworthy courage you have
				shown us! I'd like to congratulate General
				Munro for his choice. He found the ideal
				man for such a...

						KORBEN
					(to the point)
				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

						KORBEN (O.S.)
				I'll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

258	EXT.  SPACE

	The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.

259	INT.  CHAPEL

	David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of...

260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray
				later?

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				They just landed in the desert.

						PRESIDENT
					(sweating)
				How much time is left?

263	EXT.  SPACE

	Earth is in view.  The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.

264	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

267	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(afraid)
				I'm looking, I'm looking.

268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President's office.

						SCIENTIST
				...Three minutes.

						MUNRO
				We've lost contact with them.

269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

270	EXT.  SPACE

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

271	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					Two more minutes.

	The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

272	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						KORBEN
				It's up to you now, Angel!

						LEELOO
				I'm so tired...

						KORBEN
				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						LEELOO
				I want to sleep... forever...

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

273	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.

274	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch.

						SCIENTIST
				It'll be entering the atmosphere in one
				minute.

275	INT.  CHAPEL

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! And that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

						LEELOO
					(weak)
				What's the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						KORBEN
				You're right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						LEELOO
				...Like love...

						KORBEN
				Exactly.

						LEELOO
				But I don't know love... I'm like a machine
				programmed to save other people's lives but
				never to have one of my own.

276	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

277	INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				I have thousands of memories but none
				of them are mine... There is no need for
				me other than this. I'm immortal but I have
				no life.

						KORBEN
				Yes, you do! I need you. More than you
				can imagine! Stand up straight!

						LEELOO
				Why?... Why would you need me?

						KORBEN
				Because...

						CORNELIUS
					(to himself)
				Tell her, for God's sake!

	A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire.  He
rips if off.

	CUT TO:

278	INT.  CHAPEL

						KORBEN
				Because...

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of

				You tell that worthless no account son

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

                                    2ND REVISED DRAFT

                                     February 8, 1993

                

               TITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant 
               flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is 
               mournful and haunting, elegant and serene...

               ...and we CRASH TO:

               EXT - BARENTS SEA - NIGHT

               ...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless 
               arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells.

               This is the last place in God's creation that any human being 
               should be. And yet...

               ...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before 
               us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward 
               through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- 
               first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are 
               still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be 
               stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3).

               Hurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through 
               the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming 
               hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves...

               EXT - SHIP - NIGHT

               ...aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether 
               we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming 
               FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes 
               flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death 
               tug of war

                                     WALTON
                         PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!

               Riiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears 
               loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing 
               tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, 
               trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib 
               smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered 
               shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel.

               Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- 
               down on the pitching deck.

               GRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton 
               shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING 
               throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: 
               blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, 
               staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact 
               and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK!

               The base of the mast is starting to give.

                                     WALTON
                         Cut the damn rigging free before we 
                         lose the mast!

               Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men 
               begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a 
               passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks 
               a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with 
               the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high 
               above:

                                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
                         IIIICEBEEEEERG!

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope 
               knotted at the chest. He points ahead.

               WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF 
               THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. 
               The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting 
               the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying 
               these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine 
               field.

               An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the 
               foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us 
               into darkness...

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               ...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas 
               billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in 
               breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before 
               them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice:

                         HARD TO PORT!

               THE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, 
               throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel 
               is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way.

               PUSH IN on Walton and the crew:

                         It's going to ram us.

                                     WALTON
                         It wouldn't dare.

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around 
               his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face 
               white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps.

               SHIP'S POV

               world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming.  For a 
               brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing 
               back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge...

               ...and smack the ice.

               VARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES

               God just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the 
               base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a 
               symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging...

               The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the 
               crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs 
               windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below... 

               And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around 
               his chest, We hear another horrible CRACK... the sound of 
               his back breaking...

               Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming. Mast #1 completes its 
               fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section 
               of the gunwale to splinters. Utter panic. Total chaos...

               Sheer mortal terror. And as the sequence builds to a final 
               brain-splitting crescendo of sound and fury, we

               ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               Total, stunning silence.

               A glittering wasteland of ice. Breathlessly cold. Even the 
               sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of 
               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a 
               desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through 
               the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could 
               survive here. Nothing. 

               SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at 
               a permanent list. Silent. We see no signs of life.

               A flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind...

               The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. The 
               forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, 
               extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging...

               The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line...

               A familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. Beads scattered. 
               |A tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted 
               eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice...

               HIGH, HIGH ANGLE

               From the top of mast #2. A breathtaking perspective of the 
               entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. The corpse 
               of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen 
               rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown 
               wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet 
               of ice. A ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so-
               slightly on the wind, rope creaking...

               A SAILOR thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the 
               rigging, WIDEN to reveal TWO MORE MEN as they reach out with 
               long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.

               EXT - NEVSKY - LOW ANGLE FROM ICE - TWILIGHT

               Walton watches them reel the body in. ANGLE SHIFTS as he 
               turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to 
               free the ship. Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming 
               into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near 
               collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are 
               nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. Walton 
               rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.

                                     WALTON
                         Put your backs into it!

                                     SAILOR #1
                         What's the use? This godless ice 
                         stretches for miles! Would you have 
                         us chow our way back to England?

                                     WALTON
                         No. But we'll chop our way to the 
                         North Pole if we have to. Inch by 
                         bloody inch.

                                     GRIGORI
                         You can't mean to go on! Our journey 
                         is ended! The best we can hope for 
                         now is to get out of this alive!

                                     SAILOR #2
                         Aye, if the ice ever lets us!

                                     WALTON
                         The ice will break. And when it does, 
                         we proceed north... as planned.

               Cries of dismay from the men. Grigori thrusts his arm toward 
               the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.

                                     GRIGORI
                         At the cost of how many more lives?

               He's interrupted by a long, chilling HOWL. The lead husky 
               rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing 
               in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, 
               joining in, staring off across the ice.

                                     GRIGORI
                         There's something out there.

               The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and 
               launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain 
               the animals, but three more break away and take off after 
               their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.

                                     WALTON
                         You five come with me! The rest stay 
                         with the ship!

               EXT - ARCTIC PANORAMA - TWILIGHT

               The Nevsky in the distance. The dogs come howling across the 
               ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.

               BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes 
               briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin 
               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal 
               surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes 
               frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past 
               in pursuit, snarling and slavering.

               THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of 
               the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.

               Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched 
               from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.

               Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground 
               with tremendous impact before them...

               ...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight 
               of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.

               Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes 
               held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...

               ...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, 
               mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls 
               toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its 
               entrails in a red smear.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Look.

               They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, 
               ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one 
               is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross 
               themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the 
               surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its 
               misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes 
               for miles.

                                     WALTON
                         Back to the ship.

               Silhouetted against the aurora borealis. The horizon swirls 
               mysteriously with color and light. Distant slivers of 
               lightning kiss the earth. Men keep watch in furtive groups, 
               huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows 
               of vapor. A massive CRACKLING is heard. A YOUNG SAILOR spins, 
               jumpy.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Only the ice to starboard, boy.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         Is it breaking up?

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Just dancing on the current. It'll 
                         freeze even tighter come next wind.

               CAMERA DRIFTS past to another group:

                                     SAILOR #4
                         It was a polar bear. That's what I 
                         say.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         Say all you want, but you weren't 
                         there. It left human tracks.

                                     SAILOR #6
                         No man could tear those dogs apart.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         No human. We've roused a demon from 
                         the ice.

               CLANG-CLANG! The men spin. A SAILOR on starboard has rung 
               the signal bell. The men race over, crowding the gunwale.

                                     SAILOR
                         Something. In the mist.

               Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, 
               rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. 
               Scanning the darkness.

               AN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe 
               of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. 
               The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor 
               kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side 
               and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         It's the demon! Shoot while you've a 
                         chance!

               The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box 
               spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter 
               and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man 
               collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions 
               with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around 
               him.

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised.

               Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. 
               Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming 
               a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless 
               figure on the dog sled.

                                     WALTON
                         Dead?

               Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the 
               furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...

               ...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a 
               convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood 
               rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, 
               beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. 
               Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with 
               VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

               A HOWLING WIND has kicked up, pelting the huddled sentries 
               with sleet. CAMERA TRACKS past, moving steadily toward the 
               dimly-glowing window of Walton's cabin...

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               ...where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion:

                                     GRIGORI
                         Captain, I implore you. The men are 
                         frightened and angry. They want your 
                         assurance.

                                     WALTON
                         They knew the risks when they signed 
                         on. I've come too far to turn back 
                         now.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Then you run the danger of pushing 
                         them to mutiny.

               Walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on 
               the table before him.

                                     WALTON
                              (low, tight)
                         Let them try.

               Grigori is taken aback. He hears a shifting of blankets and 
               glances to the captain's bed. Walton follows his look.

               Frankenstein has awakened and is watching them.

               Grigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze. Walton rises, 
               retrieves a pot from the stove.

                                     WALTON
                         You're awake. I've prepared some 
                         broth. It'll help restore you.

                         I'm... dying.

               Victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before 
               his face. Fingers skeletal and black.

                         Would-be. I'm plagued with my share 
                         of difficulties just at the moment.

                                     VICTOR
                         I heard.

                                     WALTON
                         I can't say I blame them. We're 
                         trapped in this ice and bedeviled by 
                         some sort of... creature.

                                     VICTOR
                         Creature? A... human like creature?

                                     WALTON
                              (stunned)
                         You know of it?

                                     VICTOR
                         Your men are right to be afraid.

                                     WALTON
                         Then explain it, whatever it is. It 
                         could save the voyage. I've spent 
                         years planning this. My entire 
                         fortune.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'd persist at the cost of your 
                         own life? The lives of your crew?

                                     WALTON
                         Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge 
                         we gain, the achievements we leave 
                         behind... those live on.

               Victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls 
               him closer. Impassioned, intense:

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you share my madness?

                                     WALTON
                         Madness?

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor's face...

                                     VICTOR
                         We are kindred, you and I. Men of 
                         ambition. Let me tell you all that I 
                         have lost in such pursuits. I pray 
                         my story will come to mean for you 
                         all that is capricious and evil in 
                         man.

                                     WALTON
                              (angry, frightened)
                         Who are you?

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat)
                         My name is Frankenstein...

               And CAMERA proceeds into the bottomless depths of Victor's 
               staring eye, plunging us into:

               TOTAL DARKNESS. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. A METRONOME fades up 
               before us.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Failure has no pride, Victor. You 
                         must try again.

                                     LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                         Yes, Ma'am.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - DAY

               We hear a HARPSICHORD begin playing as a WIDER ANGLE reveals 
               a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet 
               high. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Hanging tapestries.

               VICTOR sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year-old in 
               his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar.

               MRS. MORITZ, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the 
               lesson. Her daughter JUSTINE, age 4, sits with her doll in a 
               huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she 
               listens... but her eyes are on Victor. She adores him.

               An enormous door swings open. Victor stops playing. His 
               PARENTS enter, ushering a somber and beautiful ELIZABETH, 
               age 6, across the vast expanse of floor. Victor slides off 
               the bench and faces them.

                                     FATHER
                         Mrs. Moritz, would you and your 
                         daughter excuse us?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, 
                         Justine. Bring your dolly.

               Mrs. Moritz takes Justine's hand. Justine gazes back at Victor 
               and Elizabeth as her mother whisks her off.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's 
                         coming to live with us.

                                     FATHER
                         She has lost her parents to scarlet 
                         fever. She is an orphan.

                                     MOTHER
                         You must think of her as your own 
                         sister. You must look after her. And 
                         be kind to her.

               Victor stares at Elizabeth. She returns the gaze evenly, 
               self-possessed and dignified even at this young age.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I loved her from the moment that I 
                         first saw her.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - NIGHT

               A MASSIVE BOLT OF LIGHTNING hammers from the sky, reducing a 
               centuries-old oak tree to smoldering ruin...

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               ...while Victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a 
               window, astonished at the sight.

               Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by 
                         the storm. Go comfort her.

               INT - UPPER LANDING - NIGHT

               We hear a CHILD SOBBING. Victor comes racing up the grand 
               staircase from below as LIGHTNING sends wild banister shadows 
               skittering. He caroms down the hall toward:

               INT - ELIZABETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor enters. Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult-
               size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge 
               skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary 
               boom and flash. Victor approaches and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't cry, Elizabeth.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (frightened)
                         Aren't you?

               KA-BOOM! A LIGHTNING BOLT rips overhead, rattling the panes 
               of glass. Victor does find it scary... but exhilarating.

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll build a fort. So the lightning 
                         can't get us.

               He races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find 
               and hurling them to her. Big decorative pillows from the 
               chaise, bed pillows from the armoire... they all come flying. 
               She giggles as a big one knocks her flat. Victor scampers 
               onto the bed with her. They pile the pillows around and above, 
               concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions.

               INSIDE THE PILLOW-FORT

               Victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still 
               see. Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Are you sure it can't hurt us?

                                     VICTOR
                         Nothing can. Not ever.

               She seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

               TILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass...

               INT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements 
               stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the 
               harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You must lead, Victor. The lady will 
                         always look to you for guidance, so 
                         your steps must be sure and strong...

                                     VICTOR
                         Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...aaand, one-two-three, one-two- 
                         three, twirl-two-three...

                                     JUSTINE
                         Mama, can I dance with Victor?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a 
                         sweeping arc about the room! one- 
                         two-three, twirl-two-three.

               Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast 
               room, tripping on each other's toes. They pass within inches 
               of CAMERA, bodies WIPING FRAME...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY (TEN YEARS LATER)

               ...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from 
               camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he 
               approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful 
               beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... 
                         Excellent! You'll be the envy of all 
                         the young ladies and gentlemen!

               They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor 
               as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't 
               concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws 
               her a look of reproval:

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine. Surely you can maintain 
                         better time than that.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes, Mama.

               Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as 
               Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about 
               the room, their attention only on each other.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the 
               glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor 
               perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension.

               Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying 
               to reassure him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She'll be all right.

               Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying 
               up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh 
               load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, 
               trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably 
               blocked by Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You can do nothing here. Wait 
                         downstairs.

               He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing 
               and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His 
               father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her.

                                     VICTOR
                         Mother?

                                     FATHER
                         Victor, do as you're told!

               Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She 
               squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He 
               turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...

               INT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, 
               blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               ...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, 
               the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in 
               the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth 
               appears at his side. He doesn't look at her.

                                     VICTOR
                         As a boy, I stood at this window and 
                         watched God destroy our tree.

               b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up 
               the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more 
               frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A 
               door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's 
               father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward 
               them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue.

                                     VICTOR
                         Father?

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's 
               father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes 
               spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh God. The blood.

               Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth 
               race up the stairs and pause before him.

                                     FATHER
                         I did everything I could.

               Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry.

               Father gathers them into his arms.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAY

               A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic 
               and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace.

               A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are 
               gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an 
               imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its 
               steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix.

               A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers 
               and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark 
               against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart 
               from the others, staring at the casket. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         How could all my father's knowledge 
                         and skill fail to save her?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's not ours to decide. All that 
                         live must die. It's God's will.

               Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the 
               mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes

                                     VICTOR
                         What kind of God is He to will this?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She was mother to me as well. But 
                         ours is the job of the living. It's 
                         up to us now to hold this family 
                         together. We must think of Father 
                         and be strong for him.
                              (beat)
                         I cannot do that alone.

                                     VICTOR
                         God took her from us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He left a beautiful gift in her place. 
                         A baby boy. To cherish and love as 
                         our very own. Your brother

               Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their 
               fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

                                     VICTOR
                         Our brother.

               The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin 
               voice carried on the wind...

               EXT - MEADOW - DAY

               A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. 
               Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into 
               view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his 
               ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into 
               tears.

               Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and 
               comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join 
               them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the 
               silverware and food.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Poor William! What indignant tears!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         There, there... shhh...

               Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The 
               child shrieks and wails, held aloft.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, have a care! You'll make him 
                         dizzy!

                                     VICTOR
                         The world is a dizzying place.

               She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie 
               out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, do give him here! He needs to be 
                         comforted and held!

                                     VICTOR
                         He needs to vent his outrage to the 
                         skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! 
                         Learning to walk is not an easy thing! 
                         Why should it be so?

               Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun 
               to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's the nature of all progress, 
                         William. Don't let your brother sway 
                         you otherwise.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Quite right!

               Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He 
               peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to 
               the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a 
                         feast to be consumed. Women would 
                         have you believe you must walk before 
                         you can run. Or run before you can 
                         waltz!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (laughing)
                         Give me that child before you fill 
                         his head with drivel!

               Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them.

                                     VICTOR
                         Devil take walking, ladies! My brother 
                         shall learn to waltz!

               He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use 
               resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between 
               them. Justine is gasping with laughter.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Scandalous! What would your dear 
                         mother say?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (thinks a beat)
                         One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
                         two-three...

               Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around 
               in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, 
               bodies wiping frame...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER)

               To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and 
               spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a 
               breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble 
               (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.)

               Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about 
               them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood.

               Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and 
               intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful 
               together, your heart could break just looking at them.

               Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's 
               at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone 
               would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. 
               She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. 
               Waltzing couples swirl past them.

                                     WILLIE
                         Auntie Justine, Papa said I could 
                         have a sweet.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can. But not before dinner.

               The music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, 
               the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off 
               the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You dance so beautifully together.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         And you look so lovely.

               They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra 
               recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to 
               Victor, keeping her tone light:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor? Spare me one dance?

               Elizabeth catches Victor's eye.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite 
                         out of breath.

               Victor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting 
               up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ...

               ...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big 
               moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when...

               ...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne 
               glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls 
               silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass 
               among the guests with glasses of champagne.

                                     FATHER
                         My friends, fatherly pride won't 
                         allow this occasion to pass without 
                         my raising a toast.

               Shouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged 
               forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.

                                     FATHER
                         To Victor. My son. Who read every 
                         medical book in my library by age 
                         thirteen... and then re-read them, 
                         which seemed excessive even to me.
                              (the guests ROAR with 
                              laughter)
                         Drape yourself in glory, my boy.  
                         Study well.  When you return, you 
                         return a man of medicine. I will 
                         then be honored to call you 
                         "colleague."

                                     VICTOR
                         But never your equal.

                                     FATHER
                         No. You'll surpass me.

               Applause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back.

               Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Music and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases 
               through a French door and come racing across the lawn, 
               giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a 
               tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and 
               Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Smell the air. Wonderful.

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a send-off, isn't it?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Father's so proud.

                                     VICTOR
                         And you?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Prouder still. You'll be the 
                         handsomest student there.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll have to do better than that.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You will.
                              (searches his eyes)
                         What do you want, Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                         To be the best there ever was. To 
                         push our knowledge beyond our 
                         dreams... to eradicate disease and 
                         pestilence... to purge mankind of 
                         ignorance and fear...

               He's so serious, she can't help laugh.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm not mad.

               She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. Just very earnest. And very dear.

               An extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them.

               Victor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. 
               So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. 
               They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He 
               whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         I've loved you all my life

                                     ELIZABETH
                         All my life I've known.

               They kiss again. A breath. A shiver.

                                     VICTOR
                         This feels... incestuous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is that what makes it so delicious?

               She brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister still?

                                     VICTOR
                         I wish to be your husband.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I wish to be your wife.

                                     VICTOR
                         Then come with me to Ingolstadt. 
                         Marry me now.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If only I could. But one of us must 
                         stay. Father's not strong. Willie's 
                         just a child. Who can look after 
                         them in your absence? Who can run 
                         the estate?

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I will be here when you return.

               Another kiss. Turning lustful and steamy. They melt into 
               each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire.

               These people are hot for each other. They stop, stunned at 
               the intensity. He lays his head to her breast. Their fingers 
               clasp. She whispers her secret:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         My head is spinning. I want to give 
                         myself to you.

               He raises his head. She meets his gaze evenly

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If we're to be married, must we wait?

               He touches her face. Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and 
               reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of 
               her bodice. She shivers. Closes her eyes. Lays her hand over 
               his. Guiding his touch.

                                     VICTOR
                         You make me weak.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Not as weak as I.

               She raises his hand to her mouth. Brushing his fingertips 
               with her lips. Wrestling with desire. Their eyes meet.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Our decision. Together.

                                     VICTOR
                         Your decision. For us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (hesitates)
                         I give you my soul...

                                     VICTOR
                              (nods)
                         ...until our wedding night. When our 
                         bodies will join.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor. I love you,

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. My more than sister.

               They kiss again. Gently...

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAWN

               A misty gray dawn. Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, 
               observing a moment of silence. His saddled horse is tethered 
               nearby. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll make you so proud, Mother.

               He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and 
               walks toward his horse.

               EXT - MANSION - MORNING

               Overcast and chill. An open carriage stands loaded. The family 
               and household staff have turned out. Victor stands ready to 
               go. Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace.

                                     FATHER
                         Write to us often.

               Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand.

                                     VICTOR
                         We never finished our dance.
                              (she smiles)
                         Someday we shall.

               Next is William. The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his 
               face, trying to be brave. Victor kneels and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         The others will look to you while 
                         I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.

               The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck. 
               Last comes Elizabeth. She and Victor regard each other, 
               sharing the secret of last night. A faint smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth. He kisses her cheek.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches 
               away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back 
               for a final look at the home and family he loves so much.

               William runs after him until he's gone from sight...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INGOLSTADT - ESTABLISHING ANGLES - DAY

               High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. Church steeples 
               rising among the rooftops. Beautiful.

               BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               FRAU BRACH trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight 
               of stairs with Victor teetering uneasily behind.

                                     FRAU BRACH
                         No real rooms left. All we've got is 
                         attic space. No one ever wants the 
                         attic space...

               ATTIC SPACE/GARRET - DAY

               She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted 
               path the entire length of the building; various levels and 
               areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams 
               crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. Daylight filters 
               dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated 
               with grime. Nooks and crannies abound.

                                     VICTOR
                         This will do nicely.

               UNIVERSITY - DAY

               A monumental structure of brick. A BELL TOWER TOLLS. Dead 
               leaves scurry across the lawn.

               LECTURE HALL - DAY

               PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed 
               galleries of eager young STUDENTS.

                                     KREMPE
                         In science, the letter of fact is 
                         the letter of law. Our pursuit is as 
                         dogmatic as any religious precept. 
                         Think of yourselves as disciples of 
                         a strict and hallowed sect. Someday 
                         you may be priests... but only if 
                         you learn the scripture chapter and 
                         verse.
                              (off their laughter)
                         Any questions?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hand shoots up)
                         But surely, Professor, you don't 
                         intend we disregard the more... 
                         philosophical works.

                                     KREMPE
                         Philosophical?

                                     VICTOR
                         Those which stir the imagination as 
                         well as the intellect. Paracelsus, 
                         for one.

               This reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: 
               PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses 
               on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out 
               and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction.

               SCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes.

                                     KREMPE
                         Paracelsus?

                                     VICTOR
                         Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius 
                         Agrippa...

                                     KREMPE
                         What is your name?

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor Frankenstein, sir.
                              (no response)
                         Of geneva.

                                     KREMPE
                         Of Geneva.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. 
                         Do you wish to study medicine? Or 
                         mysticism?

               Titters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused:

                                     KREMPE
                         Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. 
                         Frankenstein's suggested reading 
                         list... thankfully, that would be 
                         most of you... would be well advised 
                         to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we 
                         concern ourselves with immutable 
                         reality...
                              (specific to Victor)
                         ...not the ravings of lunatics and 
                         alchemists hundreds of years in their 
                         graves. Understood?

               Victor is flushed and humiliated. Held like to say more, but 
               wisely swallows his anger and nods.

                                     KREMPE
                         I am relieved. Are there any relevant 
                         questions?
                              (there are none)
                         Lecture hall dismissed.

               EXT - UNIVERSITY - DAY

               Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming 
               over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, 
               eyes fixed straight ahead.

               Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. 
               Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been 
               there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes 
               his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two 
               guys heading in the same direction.

               Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor 
               shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced 
               with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker?

                                     HENRY
                         I was just clearing my throat.

                                     VICTOR
                         Very well then.

               They continue walking. Silence thick. Finally:

                                     HENRY
                         You know, you're quite mad.

               Victor stops. Turns.

                                     VICTOR
                              (low, measured)
                         I am not mad.

                                     HENRY
                              (matching Victor's 
                              tone)
                         As a march hare.

               Henry's expression betrays nothing... but perhaps there's a 
               trace of amusement in his eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you having me on?

                                     HENRY
                         Of course I am. It pays to humor the 
                         insane.

               Beat. Victor smiles. Henry grins, offers his hand. Takes it.

                                     HENRY
                         Henry Clerval.

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor, Victor Frankenstein.

                                     HENRY
                         I know. You have a way of making an 
                         impression.

               INT - GASTHOF - DUSK

               The tavern is packed with students and noise. Beer and food 
               served at a frantic pace. We find Victor and Henry at a small 
               table, tearing into sausages and cheese.

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you really think I'm mad?

                                     HENRY
                         Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing 
                         you know, you'll be teaching 
                         toadstools to speak.

               Schiller enters with FRIENDS. They pause at Victor's table

                                     SCHILLER
                         If it isn't the sorcerer. Found 
                         yourself an apprentice?

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm afraid I rejected his application. 
                         He merely dabbles.

                                     HENRY
                         Dilettantes need not apply. What 
                         about you? Schiller, isn't it?

                                     SCHILLER
                         Von Schiller. I'm interested in real 
                         medicine. Treating the sick.

                                     HENRY
                         Really? I myself find sick people 
                         rather revolting.
                              (off their looks)
                         I'm here to secure my degree with a 
                         minimum of fuss and hard work that I 
                         might settle into a life of privilege 
                         treating rich old ladies with gout 
                         and dallying with their daughters.

                                     SCHILLER
                         You two disgust me.

               Schiller and his friends stalk off.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT - DUSK

               LONG LENS magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, 
               distant hills and drizzly sky. Victor wears his greatcoat as 
               he and Henry walk along a twisty cobblestone street.

                                     VICTOR
                         Rich old ladies and their daughters?

                                     HENRY
                         Can you think of a better reason?

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a few.

                                     HENRY
                         Do me a favor then...
                              (claps his shoulder)
                         ...keep them to yourself.

               Victor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               Waldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across 
               morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse 
               dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for 
               a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and 
               rolls his eyes in utter disgust.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, 
               writing a letter with quill and ink. It's raining outside. 
               The garret is tidied.

               EXT - RYE FIELDS - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               WORKERS are harvesting for miles around. PAN to Elizabeth 
               and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon. She cracks the 
               grain and tastes it, glances to Claude. He smiles and nods.

                                     CLAUDE
                         It's turning out to be a good year.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let's return a tenth of the crop to 
                         the tenants.
                              (off his look)
                         They had a hard winter.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Not even your father would be that 
                         generous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Then there's no need to tell him, is 
                         there?

               Claude grins and motions to his MEN. They resume loading the 
               sheaves as a STABLEBOY rides up:

                                     STABLEBOY
                         Miss! The mail arrived! There's one 
                         from Master Victor!

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN PARLOR - NIGHT

               We find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth 
               reads Victor's letter aloud:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         ...and not a day goes by that I do 
                         not cherish your faces in my mind's 
                         eye or ache to see you all again. Be 
                         assured that I am with you in spirit, 
                         and you are never far from my 
                         thoughts. I remain, as always, your 
                         loving and devoted Victor. P.S.

               She pauses, reading ahead.

               INSERT OF LETTER

               The P.S. reads: "Elizabeth... I am holding our vow precious 
               in my heart."

               ELIZABETH

               glances up at their expectant faces.

                                     WILLIE
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It says, give Willie an extra big 
                         hug for me.

                                     WILLIAM
                              (beaming)
                         Read it again?

               She smiles, rearranges the pages as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - DAY

               A classroom door. SHOUTING from within:

                                     VICTOR (O.S.)
                         That's no excuse for being a pompous 
                         ass!

               Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in 
               the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him:

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll see you thrown out of this 
                         university! I'll go to the dean 
                         himself! Take me at my word, 
                         Frankenstein! The dean himself!

               Classroom doors are opening, faces peering out. Waldman among 
               them. Victor keeps going, doesn't look back.

               INT - GASTHOF - NIGHT

               Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in 
               his thick, well-worn leather journal.

                                     HENRY
                         The entire school heard it. It wasn't 
                         something one could miss.

                                     VICTOR
                         You're a comfort to me, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         What now? Writing about it in your 
                         journal won't help.

                                     VICTOR
                              (quietly)
                         It's a letter to my father.

               Henry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure 
               with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of 
               his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A 
               gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman 
               enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He 
               murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to 
               Victor's table.

                                     VICTOR
                         Professor Waldman.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (takes a seat)
                         Victor, explain yourself.

                                     VICTOR
                         Krempe has a way of provoking my 
                         temper.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You have a way of provoking his.
                              (beat)
                         I've been watching you. You seem 
                         impatient with your studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         To say the least. I came here to 
                         expand my mind, but honest inquiry 
                         seems strangled at every turn. All 
                         we do is cling to the old knowledge 
                         instead of seeking the new.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You disdain accepted wisdom?

                                     VICTOR
                         No, I embrace it... as something to 
                         be used or discarded as we advance 
                         the boundaries of what is known.

                                     HENRY
                              (mutters to Waldman)
                         Now you've got him started.

                                     VICTOR
                         These are exciting times, Henry. 
                         We're entering an era of amazing 
                         breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. 
                         He wasn't content to bleed people 
                         with leeches, he pioneered a new 
                         frontier of thought

                                     HENRY
                         ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox 
                         has been virtually eliminated. I've 
                         heard this speech before.

                                     VICTOR
                         But you haven't listened, Never in 
                         history has so much seemed possible. 
                         We're on the verge of answers undreamt 
                         of... but only if we have the courage 
                         to ask the questions.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I understand your frustration. I was 
                         young once myself.
                              (beat)
                         Walk me home. Something I'd like to 
                         show you.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               The gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor 
               and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to 
               big windows where the light would be best during the day. 
               Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of 
               subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, 
               all quite excellent.

               The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter 
               with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up 
               his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of 
               tables crammed with experiments and clutter.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You know for thousands of years the 
                         Chinese have based their medical 
                         science on the belief that the human 
                         body is a chemical engine run by 
                         electricity? They say we all contain 
                         streams of energy which flow through 
                         us like currents in the ocean, or 
                         rivers in the earth.

               They arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of 
               knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Their doctors treat patients by 
                         inserting needles like these into 
                         the flesh at various key points to 
                         manipulate these electric streams.

               He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the 
               wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles.

               Acupuncture points are clearly marked.

                                     VICTOR
                         Preposterous.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I once saw it done, as a boy in 
                         Canton. My parents were missionaries. 
                         The cure was nothing short of 
                         miraculous.
                              (off their looks)
                         I've never forgotten it. Been 
                         fascinated ever since.

                                     HENRY
                         It smacks of magic.

               Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal 
               an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins 
               trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in 
               turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.

               Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as 
               the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as 
               Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet 
               flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?

               Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm 
               at the array of wires and batteries.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Electricity.

                                     VICTOR
                         It's utterly fantastic! This is the 
                         sort of thing I'm talking about! We 
                         should be learning this!

                                     WALDMAN
                         Why? God alone knows what it means. 
                         Until it has proven value, it's 
                         nothing more than a ghoulish parlor 
                         trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

                                     VICTOR
                         But the possibilities. Combining 
                         ancient knowledge with new? Something 
                         like this could change our fundamental 
                         views!

                                     WALDMAN
                         It is a thrilling direction to 
                         explore. Thrilling and dangerous.
                              (off his look)
                         Nature can be wonderful and terrible. 
                         Science is not a realm for the 
                         reckless; it needs a conscience. We 
                         must proceed cautiously. Assess as 
                         we go.
                              (drapes the toad)
                         What I do on my own time is my own 
                         business. The same holds true for 
                         you. You wish to expand your mind? 
                         Fine, do so. You can even join me 
                         here, if you like. But not at the 
                         expense of your normal studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         I doubt that decision is still mine 
                         to make.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (waves)
                         Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an 
                         apology to Professor Krempe...

               Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a 
               stern gesture for silence. Listen.

                                     WALDMAN
                         "...a sincere and heartfelt apology 
                         which you will then read aloud to 
                         him before the assembled student 
                         body and faculty.

                                     VICTOR
                         Why?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (draws close)
                         Our profession needs talent like 
                         yours. Destroy your career over an 
                         issue of pride? What a waste.

               Waldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor 
               studies it, fascinated.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Go home, Victor. Write the letter,

               DOLLYING VICTOR IN A SWW 360: He stands before the students 
               and faculty, reading his apology.

                                     VICTOR
                         ...and I further wish to extend my 
                         sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe 
                         for my display. My behavior toward 
                         him was both rash and inexcusable.

               Up in the gallery, Krempe nods grudgingly to himself.

               Exquisite silverware goes CLINKING SOFTLY onto polished wood 
               as:

                                     ELIZABETH (O.S.)
                              (laughing)
                         I knew held get himself in trouble.

               TILT UP to reveal the expansive dinner table being set for 
               guests. KITCHEN STAFF are to-ing and fro-ing. Elizabeth splits 
               her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, 
               while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement. Willie 
               gets underfoot. Father just sits.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Must've been a terrible row.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He was almost expelled for calling 
                         one of his professors a "pompous...
                              (glances to Willie)
                         Fellow..." 

                                     FATHER
                         He always was opinionated.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (reads on, laughs)
                         He set things right with a proper 
                         apology... and now they've put him 
                         in charge of dissection lab!

                                     WILLIE
                         What's that?

                                     FATHER
                         That's where they cut things open 
                         and peer about inside.

                                     WILLIE
                         Things? What sort of things?

               Father is about to press on with the gory details, but 
               Elizabeth freezes him with a glance.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too ghoulish for your young 
                         ears.

               The old man throws Willie a look. We'll talk later.

                         brilliant student well on his way to

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               A DISSECTED DOG convulses through its electronically-induced 
               paces. Kicking. Twitching. Tasting the air with its dead 
               tongue. TILT UP to reveal Victor at the switch.

               Waldman leans close to observe. Softly:

                                     WALDMAN
                         Re-configure the leads?

                                     VICTOR
                         Numbers four and twelve directly 
                         into the nervous system?

               Waldman nods.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Worth a try.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               With Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as 
               needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal 
               workings of a dissected corpse. Professor Krempe observes 
               from a distance.

                                     VICTOR
                         ...and the medulla oblongata is the 
                         transition between the spinal cord 
                         and the two parts I've already 
                         named... cerebrum and cerebellum. 
                         Any freshmen feeling queasy yet?
                              (glances around, smiles)
                         All of you, from the look of it. 
                         We'll resume your torture tomorrow.

               He waves them dismissed. They laugh and exit, relieved.

               Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens 
               at Krempe's approach.

                                     KREMPE
                         You seem to be adapting well to the 
                         approved curriculum.

                                     VICTOR
                         Despite the lack of challenge.

               Krempe reddens, but says nothing. He gives Waldman a curt 
               nod and walks off.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

                                     VICTOR
                         The strain was evident.

                                     HENRY
                         Come now, you must take some 
                         satisfaction. You've risen to the 
                         top of your class. A position of 
                         prominence and regard.

               Victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles.

                                     VICTOR
                         What keeps me going are my friends.

               He throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an 
               affectionate headlock. Henry struggles and laughs:

                                     HENRY
                         Leave off!

               JEWELER'S SHOP - DAY

               Victor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket 
               dangled before him by a smiling JEWELER. He glances to Henry 
               for an opinion.

                                     HENRY
                         Your Elizabeth must be quite a 
                         treasure, Victor
                              (pointedly to jeweler)
                         ...to justify these prices.

               The jeweler's smile goes frosty.

               WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               TIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling 
               from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent 
               miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than 
               three inches high within its penciled oval.

               Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, 
               jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally 
               large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently 
               for the portrait, suffused with daylight.

               Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. 
               Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly 
               hates people looking over his shoulder.

                                     HENRY
                              (deadpan)
                         Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

               Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his 
               brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld 
               he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains 
               of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's 
               company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is 
               fast and loose, intense and passionate:

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm quite serious. Look at all the 
                         charity and clinic work we do. Up 
                         until thirty years ago, the concept 
                         of vaccine was unheard of.

                                     HENRY
                         You're saying all disease will 
                         eventually be eradicated?

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm convinced. Not by treating 
                         symptoms, but by diving nature's 
                         most jealously-guarded secrets.

                                     HENRY
                              (turning serious)
                         Do you foresee this happening in our 
                         lifetimes?

                                     WALDMAN
                         No. But someday.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.

               A HOWL OF OUTRAGE AND LAUGHTER. Victor flings his napkin in 
               Henry's face.

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you would think of that!

                                     HENRY
                              (laughing)
                         Somebody has to!

               Victor raises his wine glass. The others join. A toast.

                                     VICTOR
                         I tell you what we need, my friends. 
                         Forget the symptoms and diseases. 
                         What we need is a vaccine for death 
                         itself.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (laughter)
                         Oh, now you have gone too far. There's 
                         only one God, Victor.

                                     HENRY
                              (raises his glass)
                         And here's to Him. Everything in 
                         moderation, Frankenstein.

                                     VICTOR
                              (grins)
                         Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

               INT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               CAMERA, TRACKS the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, 
               crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, 
               wailing babies, stampeding children. Absolutely jangling 
               with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people 
               getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams... being vaccinated...

               The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS 
               performing community service, none of whom look like they're 
               enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find 
               Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing 
               over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled 
               in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified 
               about getting his vaccination:

                                     MAN
                         Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox 
                         in it, I hear tell!

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Pox? They givin' us pox?

               Ripples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as 
               we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper 
               amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue:

                                     WALDMAN
                         No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Vaca-what?

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, 
                         meaning cow
                              (glances at her girth)
                         ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...

                                     MAN
                         I told you there was pox in it!

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...no, no, cowpox in a minute 
                         quantity, perfectly harmless, gives 
                         you a natural immunity to small ox, 
                         which is the point of this whole 
                         bloody exercise...

               Victor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. 
               The ferret-faced man is cornered.

                                     MAN
                         You doctors kill people! I don' care 
                         what you say, you ain't stickin' it 
                         in me!

                                     WALDMAN
                         I most assuredly am! It prevents 
                         disease and it's the law! Why am I 
                         explaining myself? Somebody restrain 
                         this damn fool!

               It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as 
               the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he 
               darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks 
               after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. 
               He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. 
               Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned.

               Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed 
               to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than 
               anything else. He exhales slowly.

                                     HENRY
                         Professor?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (softly)
                         Oh God.

               That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. 
               They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls 
               to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see.

               EXT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               A cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. 
               Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, 
               releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying 
               Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running 
               alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at 
               their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians 
               scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, 
               bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for 
               help...

               INT - UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY

               Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel 
               is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes 
               up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even 
               glance over. Henry whispers:

                                     HENRY
                         They just caught the man who did it.

                                     VICTOR
                         He was a frightened soul who acted 
                         out of fear and ignorance.

                                     HENRY
                         They'll hang him all the same.

                                     VICTOR
                         Good. I'll be there to hear his 
                         worthless neck snap.

               People glance back. Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep your voice down. You don't know 
                         what you're saying.

                                     VICTOR
                         It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't 
                         have happened! The bastard deserves 
                         to die.

               Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel. 
               Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy. Henry pulls Victor 
               from the pew, drags him up the aisle...

               INT - CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY

               ...and into the confessional where they launch at each other 
               in harsh whispers.

               Dialogue here is overlapping and intense:

                                     HENRY
                         You're making a scene!

                                     VICTOR
                         Why Waldman? He of all people should 
                         have cheated death!

                                     HENRY
                         You can't. Death is God's will!

                                     VICTOR
                         I resent God's monopoly.

                                     HENRY
                         That's blasphemy!

                                     VICTOR
                         Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent 
                         his life trying to help people!

                                     HENRY
                         All the more reason for us to continue 
                         his work with the poor!

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat, low)
                         No. He had more important work.

                                     HENRY
                         There are sick people who need our 
                         help. Here and now. Not in some future 
                         time. Consider that.

               Henry exits. Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his 
               hands together as if in prayer... or quiet rage. He gazes 
               up. There on the wall hangs a crucifix.

                                     VICTOR
                         Life and death.
                              (beat)
                         Why should You alone have the final 
                         say?

               VICTOR'S POV PUSHING SLOWLY IN on the Christ figure before 
               him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DA VINCI'S STUDY OF MAN rises from the image of Christ, 
               striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the 
               perfect circle. We hear a DOOR BEING UNLOCKED as...

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               ...a WIDER ANGLE reveals the deserted workshop. The door 
               swings open as Victor lets himself in. He sees the finished 
               locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the 
               beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.

               He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on 
               the wall. He stares. Intense.

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT: Things are in the process of being sorted and 
               boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes:

                                     VICTOR
                         To understand the causes of life, we 
                         must first have recourse to death... 
                         and examine the process in minutest 
                         detail...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A gray day. Waldman's ferret-faced MURDERER stands weeping 
               helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read:

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         ...his body to be left on public 
                         display for a twenty-four hour period, 
                         thereafter to be consigned to an 
                         unmarked pauper's grave. So the court 
                         has spoken.

               The EXECUTIONER draws the hood over the murderer's head, 
               cinches the noose tight. The condemned man is blubbering, 
               pleading for his life.

               Victor stands in the crowd. Watching. Waiting. We hear the 
               THUMP of the body dropping, the CRACK of a snapping neck...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               Dark as Hades. Pissing down rain. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a 
               CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, 
               lashed by the wind.

               Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of 
               his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The 
               very weapon which took Waldman's life. He gazes up at the 
               dead man... at the rope from which he dangles...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab. Victor leans 
               close, still dripping, studying the face closely. A FLASH OF 
               LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer 
               windows and skylights. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         No longer pathetic and useless

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, 
               flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth 
               gaping open and shut. He falls back limply as Victor shuts 
               the power off, making careful notations in his journal.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               TRACKING the dissection table... up the length of the 
               murderer's body... now in an advanced stage of decay... we 
               hear the SOFT BUZZING of flies...

               We find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- 
               eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. 
               Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are 
               swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS 
               it off at the elbow.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we 
               find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead 
               tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a 
               slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it 
               under a microscope.

               INT - GASTHOF - DAY

               Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, 
               scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. 
               Henry is across from him:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This has got to stop.
                              (Victor glances up)
                         Nobody's seen you in months. You 
                         haven't attended a single class.

                                     VICTOR
                         I've been preoccupied.

                                     HENRY
                         We all know how hard you took 
                         Waldman's death. Even Krempe is 
                         sympathetic. But it is time to move 
                         on. It is time to concern yourself 
                         with life.

                                     VICTOR
                         That is my concern.
                              (faint smile)
                         I'm involved in something just now. 
                         I want to finish it in Waldman's 
                         memory.

                                     HENRY
                         How much longer?

                                     VICTOR
                         Few months perhaps. I'm gathering 
                         the raw materials even now.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open.

               CAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a 
               stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, 
               working up his courage:

                                     VICTOR
                         Materials. That's all they are Tissue 
                         to be re-used.

               He pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, 
               cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises 
               the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Stone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor 
               shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low.

               COFFIN - NIGHT

               Pitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. 
               Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde 
               jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional 
               head staring through the glass, dead cats...

               ...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched 
               over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring 
               back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books 
               such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences 
               et les arts D'alchimiste," by Paracelsus.

               FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               A magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue 
               sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion 
               distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth 
               regards a stack of mail.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Nothing. Still nothing.

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's been months. It's not like him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Something's wrong. I know it.
                              (off her look)
                         I've heard rumors of cholera spreading 
                         south from Hamburg.

                                     JUSTINE
                         So have I

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I should go. I should leave today.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into 
                         Germany would be banned. You'd never 
                         get near Ingolstadt.
                              (beat)
                         Besides, they're only rumors.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (beat, nods)
                         And not a word of them to Father. 
                         He's agitated enough not hearing 
                         from Victor.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Read him one of the old letters and 
                         rephrase it. We'll say it came today. 
                         It'll set his mind at ease.

               Elizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion

               INT - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Murky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks 
               cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a 
               metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet 
               into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his 
               attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the 
               wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice.

               INT - MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               A WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. 
               Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the 
               ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor 
               is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. 
               Working to synthesize it.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be 
               a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the 
               consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to 
               reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus.

               EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, 
               checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN 
               lurk in the shadows, waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                         That one.

               The corpse is lifted off. Money changes hands.

                                     MAN
                         With this cholera come to town, we'll 
                         have plenty more for you.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away 
               with a bone saw. Tossing aside the scraps.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. He scrapes off a 
               small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break 
               apart. It doesn't look good. He glances feverishly at the 
               clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Not optimal. Must use. No time to 
                         replace. Body can't wait.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor stitches a torso with one of those big, awful curved 
               needles, yanking up hard to draw the catgut tight.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I stitched it together with my own 
                         hands...

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via 
               block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track. The body rises 
               limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, 
               long black hair covering its face.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         A patchwork man of my own devising.

               Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning.

               He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along 
               its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded 
               by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken 
               from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta."

               Beakers bubbling and dripping. Intravenous lines seeping and 
               secreting. A misty chemical haze in the air.  Victor is 
               watching his patchwork man. Glowering. Waiting.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         It took nutrients like a child 
                         receiving milk... blushed like a 
                         young girl with the blood I forced 
                         through its veins...

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips through the skylights, bathing the 
               scene purple/white. Eerier and eerier.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         ...all in preparation.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               We find Victor passed out in a chair. His creation is still 
               taking fluids. Gray daylight streams through the windows.

               There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' 
               hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or 
               wail. Victor doesn't stir. Dead to the world. Somebody starts 
               POUNDING on the door. Victor rouses, takes a moment to 
               remember where he is. He lurches from his chair, grabs a 
               canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man."

               STAIRWELL - DAY

               Henry is pounding. Finally the latch is drawn. The door swings 
               open a crack. Victor peers out. Gaunt and furtive. Suspicious. 
               Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.

                                     HENRY
                         God's sake, what is that stench?

               Henry peers past him.

               Victor shifts, blocking his view

                                     VICTOR
                         This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy 
                         just now. What do you want?

                                     HENRY
                         Things have gone worse with this 
                         cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases 
                         a day now. Classes have been 
                         suspended. University's shut down.

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes? And?

                                     HENRY
                         Listen to what I'm saying. The 
                         militia's arriving to quarantine the 
                         city. Most of us are getting out 
                         while we still can.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'll be leaving then.
                              (beat)
                         Just as well. You never were cut out 
                         for this, Henry. Goodbye.

               And the door slams shut. The bolt is thrown. Henry pounds.

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO 
                         REASON!

               Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and 
               heads back down the stairs.

               EXT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY

               Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from 
               the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their 
               possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run 
               down by a carriage.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         OUT OF THE WAY!

               Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to 
               control the animals as the carriage eases past.

                                     HENRY
                         Schiller? You're leaving? Where's 
                         all that high talk about treating 
                         the sick?

                                     SCHILLER
                              (icy)
                         To hell with them. And you.

               He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage 
               lurches away, scattering refugees before it.

               Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking 
               around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like 
               cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry 
               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned 
               at the human suffering around him as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Time running out. Rate of decay 
                         accelerating. Must strike now... or 
                         start again from scratch.

               He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab 
               before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length 
               steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling 
               above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped 
               with glittering needles big enough to knit with.

               Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been 
               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips 
               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing 
               identical marks on the body before him...

               Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these 
               spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good 
               contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...

               Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners 
               of the steel grate...

               Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig 
               into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, 
               wires and all...

               HIGH WIDE ANGLE

               ...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's 
               gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature 
               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length 
               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick 
               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and 
               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, 
               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary 
               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous 
               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. 

               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward 
               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly 
               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all 
               unlike the Da Vinci...

               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it 
               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding 
               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it 
               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after 
               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING 
               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and 
               sinister shadows...

               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper 
               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He 
               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature 
               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the 
               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.

               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, 
               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- 
               tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, 
               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also 
               suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with 
               reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he 
               swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place 
               with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, 
               spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the 
               sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.

               The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, 
               zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:

               Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking 
               the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.

               Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes 
               checking on his creation drifting in the murk.

               Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, 
               supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they 
               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables 
               along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.

               Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING 
               painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. 
               Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.

               Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.

               The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first 
               jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with 
               energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through 
               the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.

               Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, 
               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on 
               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam 
               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.

               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going 
               knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- 
               tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. 
               And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this 
               twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, 
               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming 
               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, 
               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...

               EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)

               ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster 
               and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the 
               creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless 
               gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. 
               The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to 
               side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open 
               and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.

               Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, 
               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.

                                     VICTOR
                              (muffled through the 
                              glass)
                         Live, you bastard!

               A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing 
               and spasming against the glass.

               FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are 
               scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting 
               the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp 
               and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.

               FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation 
               has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly 
               devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.

               It was all for nothing...

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its 
               mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries 
               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.

               FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his 
               hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he 
               imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.

               We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.

               Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's alive. It's alive.

               And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the 
               sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- 
               THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the 
               inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the 
               wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning 
               man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope 
               to hoist the lid away...

               ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled 
               from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper 
               shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, 
               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and 
               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry 
               and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.

               Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling 
               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity 
               passes in the space of a heartbeat.

               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, 
               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all 
               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, 
               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding 
               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging 
               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with 
               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying 
               to break the Creature's grip...

               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling 
               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, 
               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body 
               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping 
               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, 
               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking 
               his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his 
               feet.

               The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping 
               and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting 
               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the 
               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.

               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring 
               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife 
               to this ghastly birth. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         What have I done?

               The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching 
               his clothes, pawing him.

                                     VICTOR
                         LET GO OF ME!

               Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer 
               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's 
               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding 
               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding 
               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and 
               jerking in its own afterbirth.

               Silence now.

               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined 
               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a 
               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, 
               jerking wild shadows across the walls.

               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. 
               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:

                                     VICTOR
                         Massive birth defects. Result is 
                         malfunctional and vile.
                              (beat)
                         Have chosen to abort.

               He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom...

               INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, 
               and collapses face-down into oblivion. Weeping.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor 
               sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in 
               the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, 
               throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.

               Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and 
               furtive. Creeping toward the bed.

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.

               Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes 
               fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.

               Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up 
               to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, 
               thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...

               ...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. 
               Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. 
               Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING 
               to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening 
               to cut off his path to the door.

                                     VICTOR
                         Stay away!

               He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The 
               Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows 
               him with surprising speed.

               INT - LAB - NIGHT

               Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling 
               behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, 
               tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.

               Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the 
               Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with 
               pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.

               He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees 
               Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it. Drags it over. 
               Shrouding himself.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, 
               mind racing. He needs a plan. He presses on.

               INT - SHOP - NIGHT

               Victor appears at the window. TILT DOWN to reveal an array 
               of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display. Victor 
               hurls a brick through the glass. Snatches up a sword.

               INT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the 
               stairs, sword glittering in his grasp. He gets to the top of 
               the stairs...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               ...only to discover the door torn off it's hinges. He enters, 
               stunned. The thing is gone.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly 
               on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. 
               He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes 
               back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing 
               into the gale as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - ALLEY - MORNING

               Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's 
               a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking 
               Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like 
               a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and 
               confused.

               He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He 
               finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.

               TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters 
               and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him 
               eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares 
               ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.

               The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The 
               Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all 
               it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the 
               food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and 
               fighting over the scrap.

               The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his 
               feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and 
               pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar 
               against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out 
                         your deeeaaad!

               A death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, 
               DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, 
               but it's a sign of human life. He presses on...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               ...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a 
               fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, 
               though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still 
               trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling 
               out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, 
               unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People 
               trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little 
               attention.

               The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to 
               a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches 
               down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.

               It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Here! What do you think you're doing?

               The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's 
               reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.

               Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.

               The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's 
               going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience 
               with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: 
               he curls his lips back and snarls.

               He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps 
               back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman 
               SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...

               ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes 
               sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his 
               loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A 
               ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...

                                     ROUGH MAN
                         Stupid bastard!

               ...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, 
               whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. 
               Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified 
               faces on all sides...

               He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!

               ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. 
               Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning 
               him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround 
               him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, 
               whimpering for them to stop.

                                     VENDOR'S WIFE
                         BURN HIM! BURN HIM!

               The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling 
               back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob 
               sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He 
               gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, 
               scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's 
               wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men 
               start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A 
               torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.

               The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete 
               bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, 
               bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He 
               breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat 
               billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, 
               hurling rocks and sticks.

               EXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY

               The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many 
               cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a 
               wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. 
               They'll be here any second.

               He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up 
               on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. 
               The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death 
               cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, 
               gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their 
               seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we

               EXT - STREET - DAY

               Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This 
               part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, 
               stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, 
               quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among 
               them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.

               WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking 
               them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy 
               burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the 
               wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The 
               worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:

                                     WORKER #1
                         Over here!

               WORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down. Eyes also widening.

                                     WORKER #2
                         Oh my God.

               Worker #1 rips his mask away. It's Henry. He leans down and 
               grabs Victor, trying to rouse him.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor! 

               Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe.

                                     KREMPE
                         Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! 
                         Lift on three! One, two, three!

               They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and 
               carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being 
               carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with 
               heaps of reeking dead. Staring. Waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                              (delirious, struggling)
                         No... no... I'm not dead... please... 
                         Don't put me on the cart! I'm not 
                         dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!

               ANGLE WIDENS UP as they carry him kicking and screaming past 
               the death cart and on across the square...

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT - MASS CEMETERY - DAY

               A death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to 
               reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead 
               are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke 
               is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is 
               drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- 
               trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked 
               over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.

               One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The 
               Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of 
               oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering 
               over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, 
               loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...

               ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH

               ...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward 
               the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature 
               erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, 
               The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering 
               back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes 
               spinning over his head into the trench.

               WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The 
               Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up 
               in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, 
               running from this ghastly place of flames and death...

               The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He 
               knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.

               He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping 
               it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken 
               reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly 
               into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at 
               his own reflection...

               ...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the 
               water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, 
               touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...

               ...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand 
               and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks 
               up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes 
               to his feet.

               TRACKING THE CREATURE  faster and faster through the trees, 
               running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for 
               breath. Crashing through branches.

               The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, 
               scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. 
               Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something 
               comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE 
               come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a 
               cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving 
               side.

               A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, 
               frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother 
               to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.

               The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his 
               gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature 
               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. 
               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's 
               fingertips make contact with the fawn...

               A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've 
               ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the 
               doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets 
               out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, 
               crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his 
               chest. The dogs take off after him.

               DOLLYING THE CREATURE

               Running full-tilt, SHRIEKING in terror all the way. Trying 
               to save the fawn. Trying to save himself. The dogs are 
               snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and 
               bring him down. He hears RUSHING WATER ahead, crashes headlong 
               through a thicket...

               EXT - RIVER - DAY

               ...and sails SCREAMING into empty SPACE, twisting and spinning 
               as he falls, plummeting head-first into the rapids. The dogs 
               are left behind. The Creature gets swept along, gasping and 
               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched 
               protectively to his chest.

               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out 
               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over 
               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his 
               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the 
               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to 
               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. 
               He crushed it to death trying to save it. He lays it down, 
               moaning, trying to understand. ANGLE WIDENS UP into the trees 
               as we

               WOODS - DUSK

               TILT DOWN to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging 
               across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky. 
               Cold. Hungry. Wet. Tired.

               The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the 
               breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs 
               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley 
               below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. 
               That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive 
               rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).

               The Creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music 
               and the promise of warmth.

               HOUSE - DAY

               The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a 
               window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The 
               tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS 
               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and 
               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and 
               swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an 
               honest living from the soil. He heads in the same direction 
               as the Creature...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               ...and walks around the corner of the house just as the 
               Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. The 
               Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches 
               and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through 
               the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up

               PIGSTY - DUSK

               ...and finds himself in the company of PIGS. The animals 
               GRUNT and SQUEAL in alarm.

                                     FELIX (O.S.)
                         Yes, yes, I'm coming...

               The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's 
               feet stop just outside. A pail is upended. Slop pours into 
               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The 
               Creature leans forward intently. Food?

               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They 
               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. 
               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his 
               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.

               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward 
               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest 
               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He 
               places his eye to a chink between the logs...

               ...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a 
               fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another 
               view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix 
               and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND 
               THOMAS, ages 6 and 8

                                     MARIE
                         Bring Grandfather to the table.

               The old man stops playing as the children scurry over. As 
               Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on 
               the fire. It BLAZES UP. Fire and sparks. In the pigsty, the 
               Creature draws back with a fearful moan...

               ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze 
               blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering 
               what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the 
               children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from 
               the stove and ladled out.

               The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling 
               it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's 
               humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast 
               compared to pig slop...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Victor lies sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. In an 
               eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of 
               light. A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his 
               face. Victor's eyes fly open. He tries to erupt from bed, 
               choking on a scream... and Henry wrestles him back to the 
               pillow to feel his clammy forehead.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank God your fever broke.
                              (offers him water)
                         Slowly, now. Just a sip.
                              (Victor sips, falls 
                              back)
                         I've been worried we might lose you. 
                         It's been touch-and-go for a week.

                                     VICTOR
                         A... week?

                                     HENRY
                         We feared cholera. Turned out to be 
                         pneumonia, brought on by nervous 
                         exhaustion and some idiot running 
                         around in a storm.

                                     VICTOR
                         Is that your diagnosis?

                                     HENRY
                         Mine and Professor Krempe's.
                              (off his look)
                         We've been trading off nursing you 
                         in shifts. The rest of the time we're 
                         out working with the cholera victims. 
                         It's his turn for that just now.

                                     VICTOR
                         You've been going round-the-clock?

                                     HENRY
                         We catch a few hours sleep where we 
                         can. Usually here at your bedside.

                                     VICTOR
                              (deeply moved)
                         Everything in moderation, Clerval.

                                     HENRY
                         Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.

               Victor takes Henry's hand. Squeezes it.

                                     HENRY
                         It's the down-and-outs I pity most. 
                         Those who can't fend for themselves. 
                         They'll be dead by the thousands 
                         before this is done. They don't stand 
                         a chance out there.

                                     VICTOR
                              (thinking of his 
                              creation)
                         No. They don't.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This place looked like a 
                         charnel house. What went on here?

               Victor pauses, too emotional to respond. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I want to go home.

               Beat.

               Henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it.

                                     HENRY
                         It'll be months before you're well 
                         enough. Meantime, your family must 
                         be frantic not hearing from you.

               Henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand.

                                     HENRY
                         I found these. Some of the postmarks 
                         go back nine months.
                              (slaps them on the 
                              bed)
                         Why don't you open them? And when 
                         you've the strength, have the decency 
                         to ease their minds with a reply. 
                         Soon as the city ends quarantine, 
                         I'll even mail it for you. Along 
                         with this.
                              (raises the locket)
                         It's a beautiful gift. Does her no 
                         good lying here.

               Henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. Victor is 
               swept with emotion and remorse. He closes his eyes. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It can't survive.

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, 
               scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is 
               returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his 
               back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see 
               Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A 
               pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.

                                     FELIX
                         Not much to look at. Even less to 
                         eat. I don't how we're going to get 
                         through the winter with this yield.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll sell another pig at market.

                                     FELIX
                         One less for us.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll make do. We always have.

               He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort 
               him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, 
               drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature 
               watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. 
               Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.

                                     FELIX
                         I'll see if I can scratch a few more 
                         out of the ground.

               He hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch 
               Felix trudging back toward the fields.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking 
               work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, 
               Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to 
               reveal the Creature watching from the brambles...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family eat their dinner. Potatoes 
               and turnips. A glimmer of understanding in his eyes.

               EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

               A long shadow looms toward the dwelling... circling the 
               house... approaching the shed. Baskets and tools...

               EXT - FIELDS - NIGHT

               We find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent 
               moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAWN

               The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He 
               scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the 
               baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before 
               the door.

               The door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, 
               sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. 
               He sits up, gazing in wonder.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               A sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall.

               The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato.

               A pig comes snuffling at his elbow. He shoves him away. Go 
               find your own. Inside, the family is enjoying a much more 
               generous meal than the last one:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I wish we could thank our benefactor.

                                     FELIX
                         Nothing in this life comes free of 
                         cost. I'd like to know who and why.

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's the Good Spirit of the forest.

                                     FELIX
                         Who's been filling your head?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It does no harm.

                                     FELIX

                         Oh, I see.

                                     THOMAS
                         Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?

               Felix and Marie exchange a look. He's not as amused as she 
               is, but lets it go. She smiles at the children.

                                     MARIE
                         Of course it is. Now finish your 
                         food before it gets cold.

               EXT - POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. The cow is grazing at 
               a distance. The Creature creeps into view, listening to the 
               music. Grandfather senses his presence. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Who's there? Felix? Children?

               No response. He turns back. Unsettled. Continues playing.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches Marie instructing the children in their 
               letters. A half dozen words are written in chalk on a slate 
               board. Maggie is trying to puzzle one out:

                                     MAGGIE
                         ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

                                     MARIE
                         Good! And now the next

                                     CREATURE
                              (mimicking the effort)
                         ...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.

               He's delighted to have uttered his first word.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               Felix is chopping lengths of wood, dulled by the task. The 
               children are stacking the wood on a litter.

               EXT - FIELD - DUSK

               Felix and the children walk home. The litter of wood is being 
               dragged by their cow...

               EXT - HOUSE - DUSK

               Felix stacks the last pile of wood under the eaves. Marie 
               meets him at the door, takes his hands.

                                     MARIE
                         Your hands are bleeding again. Come 
                         in. I'll rub liniment.

               They go inside. The door closes. CAMERA PUSHES to the pigsty. 
               Eyes peering out.

               EXT - WOODS - NIGHT

               The Creature walks along, munching a turnip, axe slung over 
               his shoulder, muttering:

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The walls around the house are stacked impossibly high with 
               cords of wood. Felix and Marie gaze out the door. Stunned.

                                     FELIX
                         What is going on here?

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window. We find 
               Victor at his desk, reading a letter:

                                     VICTOR
                         "...but it's been so long since I've 
                         heard from you. Remember the vow we 
                         took the night you left? You must be 
                         honest with me if your feelings have 
                         changed. Answer for the sake of our 
                         friendship, and both our future 
                         happiness."
                              (pause)
                         She wrote that four months ago.

               ANGLE SHIFTS to include Henry. He's been listening.

                                     HENRY
                         A woman like that is far too rare to 
                         be taken lightly.

               Victor ponders the letter. He lays it next to the locket, 
               pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature observes another lesson. Six more words are 
               chalked on the board. Thomas is struggling with the first:

                                     THOMAS
                         Ch...uur-ch. Church.

                                     CREATURE
                         Ch...uuu...ch.

                                     MARIE
                         Good. And the next.

                                     THOMAS
                         Fl...oww.

                                     CREATURE
                         Floww...

               And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before 
               Thomas does:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...wwer. Flower.

                                     THOMAS
                         ...wer. Flower?

                                     MARIE
                         Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

               Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch:

                                     CREATURE
                         Garrr...denn. Garden.

                                     THOMAS
                         Maria! Look! It's snowing!

               The children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering 
               through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The 
               door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in 
               the doorway:

                                     MARIE
                         Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your 
                         death!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Let them play. There's plenty of 
                         wood for the fire.

                                     FELIX
                              (shoots her a look)
                         He's right about that.

               Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags 
               her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild 
               snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.

               THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having 
               the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. 
               Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         It's snnowwinng.

               EXT - HOUSE - DAY

               Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix 
               and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has 
               his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               TRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, 
               the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, 
               looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. 
               Happy as a kid himself.

               Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing 
               their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and 
               hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed 
               to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, 
               Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.

                                     MAGGIE
                         That one! It's the most beautiful 
                         tree I've ever seen!

               Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit 
               up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of 
               ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and 
               laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire

                                     CREATURE
                         Most beautiful... tree...

               The kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to 
               the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.

               The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out 
               into the darkness:

                                     MAGGIE
                         Merry Christmas!

               The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries 
               closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with 
               a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board 
               is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering 
               of a glowing angel and a message:

                                     CREATURE
                         For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of 
                         the... Forr-rest.

               He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the 
               house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize.

               He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it 
               gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to 
               reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.

               He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.

               He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes 
               going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts 
               huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. 
               Screw potatoes and turnips.

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The children race out the door to find the plate empty. And 
               a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard,

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. 
               Marie reads a book aloud:

                                     MARIE
                         ...with particles of heavenly fire, 
                         the God of Nature did his soul 
                         inspire... and pliant still the 
                         ethereal energy which wise Prometheus 
                         tempered into paste...

               The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the 
               concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, 
               and pulls out what's been there all along:

               Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds 
               the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from 
               the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head 
               this way and that. Slowly:

                                     CREATURE

               EXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature 
               approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I know you're there.
                              (waits for a response)
                         Won't you speak to me?

               The Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man 
               waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a 
               spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal.

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               ...and we CONTINUE PUSHING SLOWLY IN as the Creature reads:

                         bodieess I have... gatherrred...

               He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's 
               Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes 
               suture marks where the pieces were joined.

               The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the 
               penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going 
               wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too 
               horrible to conceive...

               ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge 
               of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the 
               massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an 
               exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an 
               animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter 
               horror, Munch's painting made flesh...

               IN THE WOODS

               ...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns 
               from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening 
               to the sound trail off. Softly:

                                     FELIX
                         God in heaven.

               A massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in 
               a clenched fist.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, 
               dropping his head into his arms to hide his face. Sunlight 
               throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats. He 
               sobs, wracked with despair as we

               EXT - VALLEY - DAY

               The house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading 
               out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow 
               before them. Only Grandfather is missing.

               The gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. 
               Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance.

               INT - HOUSE - DAY

               For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house 
               from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall.

               Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder.

               The Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks 
               from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house 
               is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings 
               silently open. His figure fills the doorway.

               Grandfather stops playing. Silence.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Would you like to sit by the fire?

               The Creature enters. Sits. Holds his hands toward the embers, 
               feeling the warmth.

                                     CREATURE
                         Nice.

                         The music? Or the fire?

               Grandfather offers him the recorder. The Creature hesitates, 
               takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. He puts it 
               to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. He gives 
               it back, huffing air, delighted.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'm glad you finally came to the 
                         door. A man shouldn't have to scurry 
                         in the shadows.

                                     CREATURE
                         Better that way... for me.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why?

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm... very, very ugly. People are 
                         afraid. Except you.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (smiles)
                         It can't be as bad as that.

                                     CREATURE
                              (soft)
                         Worse.

               The old man-reaches for his face. The Creature draws back.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I can see you with my hands. If you'll 
                         trust me.

               The Creature decides to trust. He eases forward. Grandfather 
               runs his fingers over his features. Gently:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You're an outcast.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Friends? Do they live around here?

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. Very close

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why do you not go to them?

               The Creature pauses. Emotions swirling. Afraid to continue.

                                     CREATURE
                         I have been... afraid. Afraid... 
                         they will hate me... because I am so 
                         very ugly... and they are so very 
                         beautiful

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (softly)
                         People can be kinder than you think.

                                     CREATURE
                         I am afraid.

               Grandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.

               The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest 
               like a panicking child. His monstrous eyes well up with tears. 
               Trying to get the words out:

                                     CREATURE
                         I love them... so very much. I want... 
                         I want... them to be my ff-family. I 
                         II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm-
                         mmuch...

               The Creature pauses. Trying to get the words out. And the 
               door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands 
               Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She 
               lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself 
               on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't let them hate me!

               Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose 
               in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the 
               children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the 
               Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling 
               to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, 
               Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, 
               again and again, trying to kill the thing...

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Leave him alone!

               ...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing 
               across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his 
               pleading hands. The CREATURE rolls from under the brutal 
               beating and sails out the door.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               The Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing 
               among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. 
               Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing 
               in his mind.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               A snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed 
               with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his 
               breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands 
               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the 
               anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.

               A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the 
               inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen 
               palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.

               HOUSE - DUSK

               The sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard 
               toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? 
               Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand?

                                     CREATURE
                         It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!

               Nothing. He glances around. The pigs are gone. Chickens too.

               The Creature's eyes go wide. He dashes to the house

               HOUSE - DUSK

               ...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered 
               and left behind. Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder. 
               They left in a hurry.

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no.

               HOUSE - NIGHT

               We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being 
               ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. 
               The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. 
               He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a 
               satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's 
               recorder jammed in his belt.

               A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning 
               the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along 
               with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting 
               as the house is consumed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow. ANGLE 
               WIDENING to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the 
               glacier with a walking staff. Struggling toward the crest of 
               a ridge. Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind.

               THE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down.

               Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Geneva.

               AERIAL SHOT sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind 
               itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing 
               on the ridge, sailing up over the crest... to reveal the 
               valley and lake of Geneva below.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY (SPRING)

               Sunlight streams through the dormer window. Birds twitter on 
               the ledge outside. The trees are in bloom. Victor stands 
               dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around 
               at the now-empty garret. Henry appears:

                                     HENRY
                         Our carriage is here.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY

               Bustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed 
               up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. 
               People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. 
               KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry:

                                     MRS. KREMPE
                              (watching the gates)
                         Such a terrible winter. I'll praise 
                         God to see those gates open again.

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll have all your things sent on. 
                         They should arrive soon after.
                              (Victor nods)
                         It's been a rough time, lad. For us 
                         all. But if you'd like to come back 
                         and finish out your final term once 
                         university re-opens...

               A ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening 
               as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow.

               Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Professor. For everything.

               Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug.

                                     KREMPE
                         Write and let us know you've arrived 
                         safely.

               Victor breaks the embrace. He and Henry clamber into the 
               carriage. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Take me home, my friend.

               Henry signals the DRIVER. The reins snap. The carriage lurches 
               away, easing into the flow of traffic as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small 
               package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs. Moritz as he 
               sails past her hollering his head off:

                                     WILLIAM
                         HE'S COMING HOME!

               INT - PARLOR - DAY

               Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine 
               are entertaining FRIENDS.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth! Justine!

               Father enters, trailed by HOUSEHOLD STAFF.

                                     FATHER
                         What's all the fuss? Why are you 
                         shouting?

                                     WILLIAM
                         He's coming home! Tonight!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Who? Victor?

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's what I'm telling you!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (swept with relief)
                         Thank God.

               Willie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates

                                     FATHER
                         Open it.

               Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth 
               lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in.

               Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She 
               presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's 
               miniature oil painting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's Victor!

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's beautiful! May I?
                              (takes the locket)
                         He looks so handsome.

               Elizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She 
               begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights 
               up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe.

                                     FATHER
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let this locket be a token of the 
                         vow we took the night I left.
                              (beat)
                         He's coming home to marry me.

               Instant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose 
               heart quietly breaks. Father and the others ROAR with approval 
               while Willie jumps and shouts:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Married! The two of you?

                                     FATHER
                         Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you 
                         were children!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (softly)
                         That's wonderful.

               She hands the locket back. She slips quietly from the room, 
               unnoticed by the others...

               INT - ENTRYWAY - DAY

               and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears.

               RESUME PARLOR as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory 
               conversation. Willie grabs the locket, admiring it:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth? Can I take this to show 
                         Peter?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Willie, it's not a toy for your 
                         friends.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll take extra special care, I 
                         promise! Pete's never seen what Victor 
                         looks like! He'll admire it 
                         enormously!

               Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile.

                         Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few 
                         hours.

               The boy takes off like a shot. Father throws his arm around

               Elizabeth, announcing to all:

                                     FATHER
                         Join us for champagne! My son is 
                         coming home!

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds. He 
               clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded 
               acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY

               Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket 
               clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the 
               fact that his brother's finally coming home.

               He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie 
               and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds 
               further and further into the woods...

               EXT - POND - LATE DAY

               ...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting 
               half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the 
               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly-
               pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)

               Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but 
               listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't 
               noticed him...

               ...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right 
               out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops 
               from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as 
               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:

                                     CREATURE
                         Wait! Don't be afraid!

               The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from 
               the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped 
               object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.

               At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He 
               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does 
               have reason to be afraid.

               The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, 
               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild.

               THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The 
               terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster...

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK

               Whirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff.

               Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations.

               Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen 
               staff. Carrots go flying.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine! Pay attention!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (tight)
                         Yes, Mother.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (pulls her aside)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (even tighter)
                         Fine.

               Justine sees genuine concern. She softens:

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'll be all right. Really.

               Father enters with Claude. Both men worried.

                                     FATHER
                         Have you seen Willie?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is he not back yet?

                                     FATHER
                         Claude rode over there to see if 
                         held lost track of time. They say he 
                         never arrived.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too late for him to still 
                         be out.

               EXT - MANSION - DUSK

               Elizabeth exits with the others

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find 
                         him.

               He rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking 
               up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT

               A massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields 
               on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters 
               frame, calling out:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         WILLIE!

               LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.

               EXT - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

               The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame 
               in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern 
               held high...

                                     JUSTINE
                         WILLIE!

               ...and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be. It darts 
               abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, 
               Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows 
               skittering among the trees...

               EXT - ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT

               ...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal 
               a coach clattering through the rain.

               INT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor is peering out the window flap.

                                     VICTOR
                         There! Look!

               Henry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion 
               briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road,

                                     HENRY
                         Quite a place.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         For what?

                                     VICTOR
                         This. My home. My family.
                              (softly)
                         If not for you, I'd be dead in a 
                         burial pit somewhere.

               Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder. The carriage lurches 
               violently, tossing them forward.

               EXT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor jumps from the coach as the DRIVER wrestles his rearing 
               horses under control and points. Victor turns.

               Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost. Drenched to 
               the bone. Weeping from the depths of her soul. Holding Willie 
               in her arms. The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back. 
               Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running 
               faster and faster...

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth?

               ...and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming 
               figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others 
               crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling 
               as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling 
               Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- 
               seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, 
               and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him 
               and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we

               INT - MANSION - FATHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Silence. All we hear now is the SOFT TICKING of a clock.

               Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill.

               INT - PARLOR - MORNING

               Elizabeth is sitting. Elbows crossed. Holding herself 
               together. Face ashen. Dazed. Still in shock. Mrs. Moritz is 
               nearby, looking much the same. Eyes swimming with tears.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         We'll organize another search now 
                         that it's light enough. We'll find 
                         her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

               Henry comes downstairs. He and Victor confer in whispers 
               then approach Elizabeth. Victor crouches before her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What is Father's outlook?

                                     HENRY
                         I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet 
                         and proper care he may eventually 
                         regain some or most of his strength.

               Victor squeezes her hand. Comfort and strength.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Thank you, Henry.

               There's a KNOCKING at the front door.

               INT - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

               Victor opens the door. POLICEMEN hover outside. Faces grim.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended 
                         the murderer. Not five miles from 
                         here, hiding in a barn.

                                     VICTOR
                         Who is it?

               The policemen trade uneasy glances.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         It's very unsettling, sir. And quite 
                         strange. Perhaps you'd better come 
                         with us.

               INT - JAIL CELL - DAY

               Victor is led in by policemen. The JAILER unlocks the cell.

               Victor enters as the men depart. Victor is alone, staring at 
               a FIGURE huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow. We get the 
               impression of long, dangling hair. The figure stirs...

                                     FEMALE VOICE
                         Victor?

               ...and leans into the light. Justine. Pale. Dazed. Scared

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor! It's you! Thank God!

               She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms. He reacts 
               stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Is it true? What they say about 
                         Willie? Is it true?

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes.

               She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Willie. My poor little angel.
                              (looks up)
                         Victor! They think I did it!

                                     VICTOR
                         Did you?

               Justine pauses. Stunned. Her eyes on his. Here's the deepest 
               betrayal ever experienced. Her heart turns to ash.

                                     JUSTINE
                              (low)
                         I don't believe... I am in need of 
                         your comfort... anymore.

                                     VICTOR
                              (a whisper)
                         Did you, Justine?

               Beat. She hauls off and slaps him hard enough to rock his 
               head around. Then she slaps him again. Harder.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get out!

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               The courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older 
               KITCHEN MAID is on the stand.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         I found her sobbing her eyes out. 
                         Poor thing, I said, what's all this? 
                         And she spilled her heart to me about 
                         Master Victor. How she'd always loved 
                         him, and now he was coming home to 
                         marry mistress Elizabeth.

               A MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a 
               stunned glance.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         She cried and cried about the 
                         beautiful locket he'd sent. How she 
                         wished it was hers. She swore me 
                         never to tell a soul.
                              (peers at Justine)
                         That was before the boy went missing, 
                         a'course.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Victor is on the stand:

                                     VICTOR
                         I always viewed her with brotherly 
                         affection. I had no idea of her 
                         feelings for me.

                         Rejection can be a powerful wound. 
                         People have been known to do uncanny 
                         things.

                                     VICTOR
                         But to commit so ghastly and terrible 
                         a crime against a child she loved?

               Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to 
               Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's hard to believe.

                         Do you think it possible she committed 
                         this crime?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         William was as much her child as 
                         mine. We were both mother to him.
                              (beat)
                         I believe she would sooner have 
                         strangled the life from her own body.

                         Then you consider the charge without 
                         merit.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I consider the charge imbecilic.

               INT - COURT ROOM - DAY

               Justine is now on the stand:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes. I took refuge in the barn. 
                         Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? 
                         Freezing and wet? I was exhausted 
                         and could search no longer.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And is it true, Miss Moritz, that 
                         you love Victor Frankenstein? That 
                         your heart was broken?
                              (off her silence)
                         Answer the question. Do you love 
                         Victor Frankenstein?

               Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, 
               trapped.

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have always loved him.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Is it also not true that you murdered 
                         his brother William in a misdirected 
                         crime of passion?

                                     JUSTINE
                         Murder Willie? In my heart, he was 
                         our child. Victor's and mine. Such a 
                         thing could never have entered my 
                         mind.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         So you have claimed. Yet you have no 
                         explanation for this.
                              (holds up the locket)
                         The locket last seen in the hands of 
                         the poor murdered child was found 
                         hidden in your dress the morning 
                         following the murder. The locket you 
                         so coveted.
                              (leans close)
                         How did it come to be in your 
                         possession?

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have no knowledge of that.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               A PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe 
               flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to 
               the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor 
               just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling 
               from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still 
               twitching.

               EXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT

               Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body 
               dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor 
               looms from the darkness, staring.

               And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs 
               his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up 
               into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous 
               necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. 
               He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, 
               draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to-
               eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Frankenstein.

               Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his 
               arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look 
               there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating 
               Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then 
               the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness.  
               Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, 
               gazing at the scaffold, horrified.

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!

               Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms 
               around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking 
               to his knees, weeping helplessly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.

               INT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN

               Victor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside 
               in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 
               Collier flintlock revolvers.

               MANSION - DAWN

               Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on 
               a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels.

                                     VICTOR
                         My mind was not playing tricks. He 
                         was there in the storm... gloating 
                         over his crimes... challenging me to 
                         come.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         But why risk yourself? Hasn't this 
                         family suffered enough?

                                     VICTOR
                         I've no choice

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If what you say is true, it is a 
                         matter for the police!

                                     VICTOR
                         They've done a fine job. Hanging an 
                         innocent for the crime of a fiend.

               He rams the rifle into its scabbard, turns to her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (softly)
                         Do you know this man? Is there 
                         something between you?

                                     VICTOR
                         I know only that he is a killer.  
                         And I shall bring back his carcass.

               Victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off. TILT UP 
               to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting.

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...

               Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and 
               unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the 
               glacier. A bitter wind blows...

               They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding 
               before our eyes. Primeval and vast...

               The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is 
               that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the 
               cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the 
               snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.

               The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great 
               bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box 
               from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the 
               snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair 
               of revolvers.

               He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of 
               white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the 
               flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the 
               rocks and crags. Searching.

                                     VICTOR
                         WHERE ARE YOU?

               He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then 
               FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is 
               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, 
               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.

               Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and 
               angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the 
               achievement of actually having created life.

               He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an 
               eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. 
               Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. 
               Still the Creature comes.

               Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, 
               firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.

               Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...

               ...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean 
               out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning 
               off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips 
               over the edge of the precipice.

               Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 
               30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks 
               up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge 
               to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a 
               cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him 
               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...

               INT - ICE CAVE - DAY

               ...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling 
               and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to 
               sprawl heavily to the cave floor.

               Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see 
               the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra 
               clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a 
               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.

               A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is 
               coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. 
               Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as 
               the Creature enters...

               ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers 
               down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause.

                         I've been waiting for you. Two months

                         How did you find me?

               The Creature grabs Victor's journal off the "shelf." He 
               unwinds the thong, the letters spill out.

                         your face... and all I could feel 
                         was my rage. And when I let him go, 
                         he fluttered to the grass like a 
                         sparrow...

               The Creature gazes down at Willie's body. He stares at the 
               hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream.

               Tears welling. Overcome with shame and horror.

               He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail 
               echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy.

               Victor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story 
               with tears shining in his monstrous eyes.

               FLASHBACK INSERT: - BARN

               Justine is asleep in the hay. Haggard, wet, exhausted. The 
               Creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the 
               lightning, gazing on her beauty. His hand reaches down, 
               hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her 
               breasts at the neckline of her bodice ...

                         She was so lovely. I longed to touch 
                         her... and seek her sympathy...

               The locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers. He 
               lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket

                         ...but I simply returned the object

                         two people are dead. Because of us.

               Victor is crushed by remorse. A sob escapes him.

               Victor is calming his skittish horse as the Creature looms 
               into view. Victor turns. The Creature tosses Victor his 
               journal. Victor hesitates, jams it into his saddlebag.

                         I'll be waiting. And watching.

               And with that, the Creature turns and scrambles back down 
               the nearly-vertical cliff face, leaping from crags and 
               boulders with superhuman agility. Victor watches him vanish 
               from sight.

               Victor descends the mountain, heading back to civilization.

               Victor walks his horse toward the house. Elizabeth rushes 
               out to meet him with Henry and Claude. Victor hands off the

               Victor glances over. Claude has pulled the Collier pistols 
               from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder.

                         Elizabeth, please. Things have not

               Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand. The old man 
               is a weak and frail shadow of his former self.

                         You must regain your strength to

                         your grandchildren later on. These 
                         are duties you cannot shirk.

               Father smiles faintly.

               Victor squeezes his hand, whispers:

               Murky and dark. Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a

               approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary. 
               One in particular is quite large. He rams the bar into the 
               wood, prying it open... and CAMERA PUSHES IN to reveal a 
               dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw.

                         God forgive me.

               MONTAGE:

               Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting 
               together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle. Hanging 
               the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom. Installing the 
               ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism. Playing out the copper 
               wire along the ceiling beams. Hooking up the galvanic 
               batteries and generators. Testing the electrical circuit 
               with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of 
               sparks...

                         I prayed never to see these again...

               Victor turns. Henry stands in the doorway.

                         Whatever they are.

               Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the 
               sarcophagus, circles toward Victor.

                                     HENRY
                         I won't bother asking what or why. 
                         You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just 
                         hope you know what you're doing...
                              (draws close)
                         ...because if this is a repeat of

                         pick up the pieces.

               CAMERA PUSHES PAST to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact 
               points still daubed with red...

               EXT - CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight:

               SOMEONE hunched in a grave, digging madly, dirt flying. We 
               hear the THUNK of a shovel hitting wood

               INT - COFFIN - NIGHT

               ...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He 
               peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT

               The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping 
               the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses 
               as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself 
               onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer 
               window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature 
               enters with his prize...

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               ...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the 
               table before us.

               TILT UP TO:

                                     CREATURE
                         I want her.

               Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. 
               Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes.

               Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's 
               dead. He can barely get the words out:

                                     VICTOR
                         Why... her?

                                     CREATURE
                         Her body pleases me.

               That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's 
               all he can do to keep from throwing up.

                                     CREATURE
                         Materials, remember? Nothing more. 
                         Your words.

               Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         My words.

               He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying 
               not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, 
               probing the back of the neck with his fingers.

                                     VICTOR
                         The brain stem was destroyed by the 
                         hanging. We'll need another. The 
                         body looks like it will do, but some 
                         extremities are too decayed. They'll 
                         have to be replaced. The fresher the 
                         better.

               EXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

               Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE 
               servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against 
               the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. 
               Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her 
               skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL 
               FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best 
               saucy smile:

                                     PROSTITUTE
                         Want some yourself? Or just like to 
                         watch?
                              (draws close)
                         What do you say, lover? I can make 
                         it good for you.

               The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to 
               her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her 
               off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in 
               his palm. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         I know you can.

               And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining 
               her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.

                                     VICTOR
                         What is this?

                                     CREATURE
                         A brain. Extremities.

                                     VICTOR
                         This was not taken from a grave.

                                     CREATURE
                         What does it matter? She'll live 
                         again. You'll make her.

                                     VICTOR
                         No. I draw the line.

               The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table.

                                     CREATURE
                         You will honor your promise to me!

                                     VICTOR
                              (through gritted teeth)
                         I will not! Kill me now!

                                     CREATURE
                         That is mild compared to what will 
                         come. If you deny me my wedding night. 
                         I'll be with you on yours.

               The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night.

               Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead 
               prostitute. The full horror sinking in.

               INT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING

               Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive 
               padlock. He hurries down the steps.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying:

                                     VICTOR
                         No. Not tomorrow, not next week, 
                         Marry me today.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Why the change? What about your work?

                                     VICTOR
                         It was misguided and pointless. Is 
                         your answer yes?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It is

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll leave this afternoon, right 
                         after the ceremony. Pack only what 
                         you need.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Does this have something to do with 
                         that man you saw?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         Yes. We're in danger here. Every 
                         moment we stay.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

                                     VICTOR
                         I do. But you must trust me for now.

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's 
               bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly:

                                     FATHER
                         This is not... the grand wedding... 
                         I had hoped to give you...

               He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her 
               place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST 
               faces them:

                                     PRIEST
                         We gather now in the sight of God to 
                         witness this man and woman bond their 
                         lives in matrimonial vow.

               EXT - MANSION - DAY

               Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the 
               driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT 
               MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the 
               men staying behind, all of whom are also armed:

                                     VICTOR
                         Be especially on your guard. Stay 
                         cautious to a fault.

                                     STABLE HAND
                         Who is this man, sir? How shall we 
                         know him?

                                     VICTOR
                         He is huge and deformed... and quite 
                         insane.

                                     CLAUDE
                         He killed Master William and sent 
                         Justine Moritz to the noose! No 
                         hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard 
                         on sight!

               CRIES of assent.

               Victor pulls Henry aside:

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you sure you'll be all right?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, don't worry. I'll look after 
                         your father. You look after her.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll be back as soon as I've got her 
                         far away and safe. We'll hunt this 
                         fiend down together.

                                     HENRY
                         Only if you'll tell me who he is.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         I owe you that. Done.

               A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach.

               ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW

               The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. 
               Those left behind scatter across the courtyard.

               Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to 
               reveal the Creature at the window.  In the bed behind him, 
               The old man stirs, opening his eyes

                                     FATHER
                         Victor?

               ...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go 
               wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a 
               prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature 
               reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture.

               A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, 
               dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across 
               the room, presses him against the wall.

                                     PRIEST
                              (breathless with horror)
                         You're the Devil himself.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes, and I've come to snatch your 
                         soul...
                              (leans close)
                         ...unless you tell me where they've 
                         gone.

               EXT - LAKE GENEVA - DUSK

               A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds 
               roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, 
               rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal...

               EXT - FERRY DOCK - DUSK

               Claude trotting to the window of the coach.

                                     CLAUDE
                         That was the last ferry. There's 
                         nothing else till morning.

                                     VICTOR
                         Damn it

                                     CLAUDE
                         We'll ride on ahead and secure you 
                         lodging for the night.

               EXT - RESORT - NIGHT

               A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is 
               raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances.

                                     VICTOR
                         Make sure you keep your pistols dry

                         They're dry enough. And if they fail, 
                         we've others. And if those fail...
                              (draws his saber 
                              halfway)
                         ...we can always gut the bastard.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. 
                         Now why don't you go upstairs to 
                         your wife? It's not often a man has 
                         his wedding night.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles.

               Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted 
               through the sheer white nightgown.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're soaking.

               She approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, 
               awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms 
               demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister no more.

                                     VICTOR
                         Now husband and wife.

               He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.

                                     VICTOR
                         I remember the first time I ever saw 
                         you. Crossing the floor of the grand 
                         ballroom with my parents at your 
                         side. So beautiful even then.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (a whisper)
                         I have been waiting for this ever 
                         since.

               She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, 
               triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable...

               ...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, 
               CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning 
               like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now 
               onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, 
               bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...

               Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor 
               sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up 
               the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...

               ...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.

               He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed 
               and ready on the nightstand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor!

                                     VICTOR
                         Open this door for no-one!

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his 
               pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain:

                                     GUARD #2
                         I saw him in a flash of lightning! 
                         He vanished toward the lake!

                                     CLAUDE
                         Get after him!

               Several men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and 
               Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature 
               clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent 
               smile. He scurries  silently up, further and further into 
               the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the 
               balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the 
               floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch...

               The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth 
               spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature 
               enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't bother to scream.

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men come running back from the lake. They stop before 
               Victor and Claude.

                                     GUARD #3
                         We lost him.

               And GUARD #4's eyes drift up:

                                     GUARD #4
                         Why are those open?

               Victor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The 
               French doors are swaying in the wind.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves 
               inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She 
               makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, 
               spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light 
               of the fireplace.

               The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes 
               between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She 
               peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You don't want to hurt me.

               He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.

                                     CREATURE
                         You're more lovely than I could ever 
                         have imagined.

               FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men 
               throwing their shoulders at the door...

                                     VICTOR
                         ELIZABETH!

               ...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls.

               She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't 
               have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. 
               He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest 
               with pile-driver force...

               INT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT

               ...and her SCREAM is cut short. The men give one last mighty 
               rush at the door...

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               ...and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade 
               back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain. The Creature 
               whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...

                                     CREATURE
                         I keep my promises.

               ...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, 
               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade 
               of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded 
               window head-on with the force of an anvil...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               ...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of 
               shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and 
               vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM 
               OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, 
               cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking 
               moans and sobs of despair:

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         Oh God... he took her heart... he 
                         took her heart from me...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the 
               downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.

               EXT - ROAD - NIGHT

               The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a 
               frenzy, faster and faster.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps 
               down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry 
               appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past 
               him...

               MANSION - NIGHT

               ...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.

               ATTIC - NIGHT

               The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. 
               Gazing at the gleam of copper...

               MONTAGE:

               And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking 
               and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking 
               the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the 
               body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening 
               the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the 
               switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the 
               body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, 
               battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering 
               the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the 
               eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the 
               spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the 
               copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...

               Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches 
               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out 
               his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle 
               a newborn infant's...

               ...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal 
               Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and 
               collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Live.

               Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to 
               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing 
               in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start 
               her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft 
               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave 
               violently to dispel the fluid...

               He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers 
               and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping 
               her hand in his. Comfort and strength...

               Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.

               Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, 
               draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up 
               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name.

               Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you 
                         remember. Say my name.

               Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.

               Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         You must. You must.

               Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name. Say you remember.

               And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white 
               hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it 
               out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of 
               recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping 
               slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He 
               smiles, blinking back tears...

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes. I'll help you remember.

               And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's 
               imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, 
               perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into 
               the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's 
               eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.

               You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for 
               guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.

               Trace memories.

               A waltz.

               And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and 
               hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances 
               with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to 
               remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really 
               comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush 
               and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, 
               music only he can hear...

                                     VICTOR
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.

               ...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on 
               the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. 
               Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. 
               Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally 
               finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under 
               the circumstances, it'll have to do...

               ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in 
               glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes 
               them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening 
               across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, 
               climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo 
               with jagged glass claws...

               ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. 
               Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but 
               rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:

                                     CREATURE
                         She's beautiful.

                                     VICTOR
                         She's not for you.

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. 
                         Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper 
                         suitor.

               The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering 
               step. Drawn to him.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth, no!
                              (she turns, puzzled)
                         Say my name.

               Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged 
               child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to 
               remember... but can't remember what remembering means.

               They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught 
               between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.

               Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts 
               toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. 
               Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A 
               frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look 
               like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of 
               flesh like a patchwork.

               She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.

               One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars 
               marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, 
               sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization 
               creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to 
               Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh 
               God, what's happened to me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Vic... tor?

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no...

               ...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest 
               pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. 
               She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to 
               find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to 
               peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her 
               own eyes.

               Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering 
               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. 
               The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.

                                     CREATURE
                         GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

                                     VICTOR
                         SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY 
                         NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

               Yes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away 
               from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across 
               the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...

               ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before 
               they can stop her.

                                     VICTOR
                         NO!

               She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay 
               with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. 
               But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing 
               in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... 
               loathing for herself for what she's become.

               It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no 
               part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp 
               in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. 
               WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts 
               past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead 
               flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as 
               she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the 
               Creature racing after her...

               INT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

               ...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything 
               she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls 
               herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she 
               plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up 
               on impact.

               VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the 
               walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in 
               Hell.

                                     VICTOR
                         You killed her! You killed her!

               He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning 
               down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes 
               down at his Maker one last time...

                                     CREATURE
                         We killed her.

               And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath 
               a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are 
               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.

               Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man 
               Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his 
               side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor.

               No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.

               He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack 
               horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.

               He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a 
               restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a 
               stranger... and then his features soften.

                                     VICTOR
                         All that I once loved lies in a 
                         shallow grave. By my hand.

                                     HENRY
                         Let it go.

               Victor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the 
               dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing 
               the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         You should have been my father's 
                         son. He would have been so proud.

               Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his 
               horse. Henry runs after him, shouting:

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! COME BACK!

               But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. 
               The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from 
               sight, as Willie did so long ago...

               EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY

               The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept 
               glacier ...

               INT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY

               Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is 
               now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot 
               where the campfire had been...

               EXT - GLACIER - DAY

               A panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of 
               footprints stretching off before us.

               Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy 
               horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.

               He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by 
               the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I followed his trail north... always 
                         north... and always one step behind... 
                         never stopping... driven by my fires 
                         of rage... and revenge...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT

               Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able 
               to speak, drained now of everything.

                                     VICTOR
                         A year now I've followed him. Perhaps 
                         more. Only to arrive at this place. 
                         Tired. So very tired. I never did 
                         find... whatever it was... I was 
                         looking for... and neither will you, 
                         my friend.
                              (off Walton's look)
                         Value life above ambition... or those 
                         glittering prizes you seek will 
                         crumble to dust in your fingers... 
                         as they have in mine.
                              (reaches out feverishly)
                         See your loved ones again. I cannot.

               Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. 
               Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Rest now.

               Victor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits 
               And waits...

               A SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil...

               Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. 
               Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A 
               peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward 
               off the chill. Exits the cabin.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT

               Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the 
               ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how 
               warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze.

                                     WALTON
                         A warming wind.

                                     GRIGORI
                         This ice will break yet.
                              (glances over)
                         How's our guest?

                                     WALTON
                         He died. Raving about phantoms. He 
                         was mad, poor devil.
                              (beat)
                         Gather a detail. Have the body removed 
                         from my cabin.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Aye, Captain.

               Grigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads 
               back to his cabin.

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Walton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING.

               He can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He 
               glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.

               He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into 
               view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding 
               the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.

                                     WALTON
                         Who are you?

               The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim 
               yellow light:

                                     CREATURE
                         He never gave me a name.

               Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the 
               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen 
               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with 
               fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned.

                                     CREATURE
                         You were with him at the end.

                                     WALTON
                              (finds his voice)
                         Yes.

                                     CREATURE
                         I was watching.

               Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the 
               breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his 
               gaze to Victor.

                                     CREATURE
                         I longed to be with him. But I wanted 
                         his final moments to have peace. I 
                         could see you were a friend to him.

                                     WALTON
                         What is that to you? Evil as you 
                         are.

                                     CREATURE
                              (swivels his gaze)
                         I am as he made me. In his own image.

                                     WALTON
                         You drove him to his torment.

                                     CREATURE
                         And he drove me to mine.

                                     WALTON
                         Then why weep for him?

                                     CREATURE
                         Would you not? He was father. And 
                         mother. We fell from grace together. 
                         He from his God. I from mine.

               The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up 
               with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         Could we ever have forgiven?

               The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in 
               shadow to the door. Pauses.

                                     CREATURE
                         I've never been shown a kindness. 
                         Show me one now.

                                     WALTON
                         What kindness?

                                     CREATURE
                         Build for him a pyre. Light up the 
                         sky with his passing.

               And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the 
               night...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen 
               mast, axes rising and falling in waves...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier 
               of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough 
               canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice.

               Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads 
               a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small 
               campfire drifts past.

               Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances 
               to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other 
               men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.

               Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He 
               dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men 
               back away, preparing for the coming blaze...

               ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The 
               men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their 
               bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in 
               frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching.

                                     PILOT
                              (softly)
                         Christ.

               Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks 
               the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, 
               denying his aim.

                                     WALTON
                         It has a right to bear witness.

               Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more 
               unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. 
               Men start backing toward the ship.

                                     WALTON
                         Stand fast. All of you.

               The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards 
               out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. 
               Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of 
               flame. Walton moves forward...

               ...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads 
               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some 
               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.

               It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an 
               earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and 
               force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!

               Ice cascading skyward.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!

                                     GRIGORI
                              (whips toward Walton)
                         TORCH THE DAMN THING!

               Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The 
               torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.

                                     WALTON
                         BACK TO THE SHIP!

               The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full 
               retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for 
               miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton 
               to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A 
               heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go 
               for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...

                                     GRIGORI
                         LEAVE IT!

               ...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift 
               opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course 
               across the ice, separating them from the torch.

               They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the 
               others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.

               THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein 
               snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.

               NO

               He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a 
               massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of 
               cascading water and spinning fragments.

               THE NEVSKY

               The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to 
               the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the 
               ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:

               THE CREATURE

               racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a 
               wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him 
               from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.

               THE NEVSKY

               breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, 
               triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew 
               hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet 
               into the icy water.

               THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped 
               on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to 
               plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice 
               crashing down after him. Gone.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears 
               between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a 
               teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back 
               but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping 
               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.

               Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag 
               him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the 
               ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori 
               thunderously into the drink.

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as 
               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching 
               the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to 
               the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their 
               fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.

               FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on 
               its own ice floe.

               THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.

               ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

               Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces 
               of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and 
               strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms 
               thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight 
               of his own clothing.

               Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water 
               himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's 
               dying right in front of Walton's eyes.

                                     WALTON
                         SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!

               Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing 
               for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his 
               head back with a bellow of anguish...

               ...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And 
               impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against 
               the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He 
               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... 
               and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and 
               up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath 
               him. The face of a nightmare.

               The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air 
               right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton 
               scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.

               The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out 
               his arm, fingers grasping to help.

                                     WALTON
                         Swim.

               The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting 
               away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to 
               him. Come. Grab my hand.

               The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the 
               torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps 
               him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.

               CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered 
               by ice floes on all sides. Going under.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated 
               ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding 
               nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.

               Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water 
               and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.

               BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony 
               fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.

               The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion 
               and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.

               Swims grimly on.

               ABOARD THE NEVSKY

               The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men 
               shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing 
               off. The men crowd to his-side.

               THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch 
               held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This 
               is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and 
               sinking beneath the surface...

               ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe 
               upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself 
               from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of 
               exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the 
               top. Never giving up.

               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the 
               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's 
               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across 
               the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his 
               creation's knees, content to be shown the way...

               The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading 
               his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his 
               skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. 
               So very cold.

               He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, 
               pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks 
               down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated 
               wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his 
               free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother 
               comforting a baby.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:

                                     GRIGORI (SOFTLY)
                         Don't do it...
                              (screaming)
                         FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!

               THE CREATURE

               turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering 
               in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the 
               sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         For God's sake... I will.

               And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot 
               ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME 
               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. 
               Blossoming. Roiling.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:

               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant 
               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair 
               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, 
               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from 
               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. 
               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps 
               it never will...

               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight 
               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams 
               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.

               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The 
               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers 
               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:

                                     WALTON

               HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The 
               Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through 
               a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.

                         LONG SHOT
          The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A
          broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its
          way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the
                         LEGEND:
                         
           HAWAII, 1941
           SIX MONTHS BEFORE
                          PEARL HARBOR
                         
          The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier
          gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.
          He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward
          camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward
          steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW"
          for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears
          an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where
          chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the
          door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G
          COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs
          out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed
          broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny
          and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his
          face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.
                         
                          MAGGID
           Fine way to pass the time. Good for
           the mind.
                         
                          PREW
           Hello, Maggio.
                         
          Maggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Prew...?
                         
                          PREW
                          (NODS)
           I transferred out of Fort Shatter.
                         
          Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes
          have been removed. Prew follows his glance.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           You quit the Bugle Corps...?
           2.
                         
                         
                         
          Prew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           To here...?
                         
                          PREW
                          (SHRUGS)
           That's what the orders say.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           You made a bad mistake. This outfit
           they can give back to Custer.
                         
          Prew smiles slightly, starts toward door.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           The Captain ain't in yet.
                         
          Prew puts down his barracks bags.
                         
                          PREY
           I'll look around.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (smiles for first time)
           Maybe we borrow some money from a
           twenty per cent man and take a real
           trip to town some night.
                         
                          PHEW
           Maybe.
                         
          TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET
          Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street.
          He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles
          it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances
          through the screen door, goes in.
                         
          INT. DAYROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
          Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is
          empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool
          table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle
          mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the
          wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
          The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew
          addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.
          He watches the balls hurry around the table.
           3.
                         
                         
                         
           WARDEN'S VOICE (O. S.)
           What're you think you're doing!?
           Why ain't you out in the field with
           the Compny? What's your name?
                         
          The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly.
          CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN,
          almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful,
          has a neatly-trimmed moustache.
                         
                          PREW
           Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yeah. I heard about you.
                         
                          PREW
           I heard about you, too, Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Well, put up that cue and come
           along. This here's a rifle outfit,
           Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy
           yourself before sundown. The Man's
           very particlar about little things
           like that.
                         
          Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and
          follows him.

          as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces
          ahead. They go into the Orderly Room.
                         
          INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room.
          MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First
          Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers,
          etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Mazzioli! Grant went to the
           hospital yesterday. Did you make up
           his sick record? Did you make a
           note for the morning report?!
           You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy
           Sickbook is your job!
           4.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Those medics didn't get the
           Sickbook back till late yesterday --
           I'll tend to it right now --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Thanks. I already done it for you.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,
          stares at the other man as if still incredulous.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           But you the beat bugler they got
           over at Shatter. You probly the
           best on this whole Rock.
                         
          In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at
          Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.
                         
                          PREW
           That's true.
                         
          Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper
          basket.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Well, friend, I feel for you. But
           from my position I can't quite
           reach you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Ten-sh-HUT!
                         
          Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen
          door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears
          cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of
          himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods
          pleasantly.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease. Good morning, men.
           Anything special this morning,
           Sergeant Warden? I've only a few
           minutes.
                         
                          WARDEN
           New man here, sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Oh, yes. Bring him in.
           5.
                         
                         
                         
          Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward
          the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.
                         
          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter. A
          placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby
          has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats
          himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of
          prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On
          Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very
          attractive blonde woman. Prewitt comes to attention in front
          of Holmes' desk.
                         
                          PREWITT
           Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt
           reporting to the Compny Commander
           as ordered.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease.
           (takes papers out of
           drawer, glances through
                          THEM)
           They sent your service record
           over... Twenty-two years of age...
           born in Kentucky... enlisted first
           at Fort Myer, Virginia... Bugle
           Corps... re-enlisted for overseas
           duty... Fort Shafter... First
           Bugler...
                          (BENIGNLY)
           Prewitt, I always make it a policy
           to talk to my new men. It's
           important for an officer and his
           men to understand each other. Now I
           have a fine smooth-running outfit.
                         
          ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
          Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with
          unholy glee.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Plenty of room for advancement for
           a man who knows how to soldier. But
           he's got to show me he's got it on
           the ball. I don't know what you've
           been used to in the Bugle Corps,
           but in my outfit we run it by the
           book. What kind of trouble were you
           in over there?
           6.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           No trouble, sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What made you transfer out, then?
                         
                          PREW
           It's a personal matter, air.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Oh. I see...
                         
          He studies Prew for a moment, sees Warden on the edge of his
          chair, watching hawk-like.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Something you wanted to ask,
           Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (EXPLODES SUDDENLY)
           Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had
           Corpral's stripes in the Bugle
           Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to
           buck Private to transfer to an
           Infantry Compny. Why? Because you
           like to hike?
                         
                          PREW
           I dint have no trouble if that's
           what you mean.
                         
                          WARDED
                          (GRINS SUDDENLY)
           Or was it just because you couldn't
           stand to bugle?
                         
                          PREW
           It was a personal matter.
                         
                          WARDEN
           That's up to the Compny Commander's
           discretion to decide.
                         
                          PREW
           (looks straight at Warden)
           All right. I was First Bugler at
           Shafter for two years. The topkick
           had a friend who transferred in
           from the states. Next day he made
           him First Bugler over me.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           And you asked out on account of
           that!?
                         
                          PREY
           Maybe I just ain't sensible... But
           that's the reason.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (SNORTS)
           His feelings were hurt! Kids they
           send us now!
                         
          Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at
          his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern
          himself with. Holmes speaks blandly, winningly.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I've got a mighty sour Company
           Bugler here... but I suppose you
           wouldn't want that job.
                         
                          PREY
           No, air.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (SMILES)
           Well, we'll get your stripes back
           for you, maybe an extra one for
           good measure. You know why you were
           sent over here when you requested
           transfer?
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir.
                         
                          HOLDS
           I pulled a few strings. I'm the
           Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I
           saw your fight with Connors in the
           Bowl year before last. With any
           luck you should have won it. I
           thought for a while, in the second
           round, you were going to knock him
           out.
                         
                          PREW
                          (TENSE)
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES
           8.
                         
                         
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (BITTERLY)
           My Regiment got beaten last year in
           the finals, as you know.
                          (SAVAGE INSISTENCE)
           But I mean to win this year. And I
           will. All I've needed was a top
           middleweight.
           (waves at pictures)
           Next year I'll hang your picture up
           there with the others, my boy.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW
                         
                          PREW
           I'm sorry, air. But I quit
           fighting.
                         
           HOLMES.
           Quit fighting? When? What for?
                         
                          PREW
           I just stopped, sir... After --
           Maybe you heard about what
           happened...
                         
                          HOLMEB
           You mean that fallow you hurt --
           the one that went blind?
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          Prew's lips are drawn tight. He nods almost imperceptibly.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to
          Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and
          then to listen.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Yes, it's too bad about that. I can
           understand how you feel. But those
           things happen in this game. A man
           has got to accept that possibility
           when he fights.
                         
                          PREW
           That's why I decided I would quit,
           sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (LESS WARMLY)
           But on the other hand, look at
                          (MORE)
           9.
                          HOLMES(CONT'D)
           it this way. What if all fighters
           felt like that?
                         
                          PREW
           They don't.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Would you have us disband our
           fighting program because one man
           got hurt?
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir. I dint say --
                         
                          HOLMES
           You might as well say stop war
           because one man got killed. Our
           fighting program is the best morale
           builder we have off here away from
           home.
                         
                          PREW
           I don't want it disbanded, sir.
                          (DOGGEDLY)
           But I don't see why any man should
           fight unless he wants to.
                         
                          HOLMES
           It looks to me like you're trying
           to acquire a reputation as a lone
           wolf, Prewitt. You should know that
           in the Army it's not the individual
           that counts. If a man wants to get
           ahead he has certain
           responsibilities to fulfill that go
           beyond the regulations. It might
           look as though I were a free agent,
           but I'm not. Nobody is.
                         
          Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is
          not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to
          attention.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Maybe you'll change your mind. In
           the meantime just don't make any
           mistakes in my outfit.
                          (TO WARDEN)
           I've got to go into town. Is there
           anything else for me today,
           Sergeant?
           10.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           (holds up papers)
           Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's
           got to be made out. It's due
                          TOMORROW --
                         
                          HOLMES
           You make it out. Is that all?
                         
                          WARDEN
           (holds up more papers)
           No, sir!
                         
                          HOLMES
           Well, whatever it is, you fix it.
           If there's anything that has to go
           in this afternoon, sign my name. I
           won't be back.
                         
          He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire
          basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the
          sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up
          the papers.
                         
                          WARDEN
           He'd strangle on his own spit if I

           for him.

           Come on. I'll show you the Supply
           Room.
                         
          Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following.

           Holmes' boxing squad? You put your
           head in a noose. Things are soft
           for a boxer in his Compny.
           Otherwise, you better know how to
           soljer.

          A convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the
          Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets
          out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to
          the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her.
          Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into
          the Orderly Room.

           His wife. Captain Holmes'.
                         
          They resume walking.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight
           because Captain Holmes got a bee in
           his hat he needs a winnin team to
           make Mayor. And if you don't do it
           for him you'll do it for me. I only
           been in this outfit eight months
           myself but I learned one thing. My
           job is to keep him happy. The more
           he's happy the less he bothers me
           and the better I run his Compny. So
           we know where we stand, don't we,
           kid?
                         
                          PREW

           Maybe back in the days of the
           pioneers a man could go his own
           way. But not in our time, kid.
           Today you got to play ball. You got
           to divide it all by two.
                         
          They have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it
          reads: SUPPLY ROOM.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM
          SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and
          leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish-
          looking man, about thirty-five.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Lava! Can't I once walk by this
           Supply Room and find you workin
           with both hands!
                         
                          LEVA
           (comes up to door)
           I can't do no better on what you
           people pay me.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Draw some supplies for this man.
                          (TO PREW)
           That's G Compny barracks over
           there. Get rid of your bags and
           come back here, and Leva'll find
           you a cart to lug your stuff over
           in. Save you makin four five trips.
                         
                          PREW
           (surprised, pleased)
           Okay.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I just hate to see energy wasted.
           Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin
           yours.
                         
          Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the
          Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that
          direction.
                         
          LONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE
          as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a
          considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a
           13.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA
          watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter.

          LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV
          as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out,
          she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's
          voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen
          gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few
          yards away, they are practically whispering.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Army women... They're cold,
           they got no more warmth than a
           diamond. There's no pleasure in
           them...
                         
                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Yeah, but this one knows the
           score... Like I been tellin you.

                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Okay, not around here. But I was
           back at Fort Bliss with Holmes.
           When they was married only a year
           or two. I heard plenty about the
           lady then. Plenty.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           You heard.
                         
                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Okay, never me. But a lot of them.
           I know some of the Use she played
           'around with, don't tell me.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           I ain't tellin you. You're tellin
           me.
                         
          Karen stops, a few paces from camera.
                         
                          KAREN
           Good morning, Sergeant.

          Lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. During
          the dialogue, Karen seems irritated by Warden, who looks at
          her coolly, appraisingly, physically.
                         
                          KAREN

                          WARDEN
           Captain Holmes just went in town,
           ma'am.
                         
                          KAREN
           Oh. Of course, He was to have left
           some things for me.
                          (STUMBLES SLIGHTLY)
           That he was to have purchased. Do
           you know anything about them?
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, ma'am, I don't. Is there
           anythin I can do for you?
                         
           KAREN.
           No, thanks, Sergeant.
                         
          She makes slight move to go, pauses.
                         
                          KAREN
           He's been telling me quite a bit
           about you lately. My husband. He
           says you're very efficient.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, ma'am.
                         
                          KAREN
           What is it that makes you so
           efficient, Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I couldn't help it if I was born
           smart, ma'am.
                         
          Karen laughs suddenly, loudly.
                         
                          KAREN
           I love that. Well, good-bye,
           Sergeant.
                         
          Karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car.
          Warden and Leva watch her. When she is out of earshot Leva
          speaks.

          MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing
          table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying
          the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and
          tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard
          pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush
          strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard
          opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not
          answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks.
          Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair.

           Success, he said. Success in war,
           success in peacetime... And not a

          CLOSE SHOT KAREN SHOOTING INTO MIRROR ON DRESSING TABLE
          Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she
          looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her
          face. She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb.
                         
                          HOLMES VOICE
           If it were so, don't you think I'd
           admit it? The way things are
           between us now? What right have you
           to always be accusing me?
                         
                          KAREN
           What right?

          They are both tense now. Holmes is out of the chair and
          pacing. Karen combs her hair spasmodically.
                         
                          HOLMES
           That again. How long will it be, I
           wonder, before I'm allowed to live
           that down? After eight years, how
           many times do I have to tell you It
           Was An Accident?
                         
                          KAREN
           That makes it all right, I suppose!
                         
                          HOLMES
           I didn't say that. I know what it's
           done to you, but --
                         
                          KAREN
           You know I hate to talk about it!
                         
          He moves over to her.
                         
                          HOLM ES
           How many times do I have to tell
           you I'm sorry, about that? How many
           times that I had no way of knowing -
                         
          He puts his hands on her shoulders. Karen shakes away, rises,
          faces him.
                         
                          KAREN
           You had a way of knowing, Dana. I
           want to go to bed. Please get out
           of my bedroom.
                         
          Holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room,
          closing the door behind him. There is a moment of silence,
          then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two.

          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
          The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of
          pool balls is heard over shot. Warden is reading a
          newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads:
          JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap,
          looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully.
                         
          FULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE
          Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool.
          Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and
          tolerance. He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice. The

          table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of G
          Company. They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man
          weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his
          eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as
          an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian;
          HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good-
          looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a
          Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching
          with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots
          and misses.
                         
                          CHOATE
           I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight.
                         
          Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Man, what I would not give to have
           this character in the corner
           poolroom in my home town: I'd dress
           him up on overhalls and a straw hat
           and put a grass in his teeth, and I
           would make a whole mint of ghelt
           off him!
                         
          Choate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot.
                         
                          WILSON
           We'd of won last year if we had a
           good middleweight. You box as good
           as you used to over at Shatter
           we're a cinch this year.
                         
          Prew doesn't respond. He bends over his cue again.
                         
                          THORNHILL

           You no talk now, Prewitt. But out
           in field with us you sing different
           song. An don't think you are tough
           guy. Quickest way to stockade is
                          BEING TOUGH

           Lissen, it's his right not to fight
           if he don't want. Without bein
           kicked around. Now, we playin pool.

           Trainin season starts next week --
                         
          Prew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an
          inner turmoil as by the men. His control snaps suddenly.
                         
                          PREW
           I told you I quit fightin! I'm
           through! An that's all she wrote:
           You guys want to put the screws on,
           go ahead. I can take anything you
           hand out!

           Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred.
                         
          The five men move off, file out of the Dayroom.

          In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine
          but most of them are in their bunks. Over shot the sound of a
          bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished
          in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on
          adjoining bunks, smoking. Choate's voice is almost linked to
          his last speech of preceding scene.

           years in this Army. They even up.
                         
          In b. g. Warden and SERGEANT PETE (POP) KARELSEN come through
          from the latrine. The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog-
          face, about fifty.

          Warden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a
          small room off the main squadroom. Warden's big, powerful
          body is covered only by a towel around his loins. He smiles
          at Prew.

          He moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen.

           The Warden? He's a wild man. He was
           in the 15th when they seen their
           action in the Settlement in
           Shanghai. I heard about it down in
           the Philippes even. He got himself
           a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it
           but you'd never know it if I dint
           tell you. This next war comes,
           Warden'll be right in there,
           standin up on the skyline, trio to
           get himself killed, but nothing
           will ever touch him. He'll come

          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          as he strips the rifle. (This mechanical operation should be
          interesting to audiences; a good man can field strip the
          weapon in thirty or forty seconds.) Prew finishes the job and
          CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE on shelter half where all the parts are
          laid out.

           'at's fair time. Now lemma see you
           put it together.
                         
          Prew's hands start to work over rifle parts, putting them
          together.

          CLOSE SHOT THE RIFLE
          in Prew's hands, assembled, CAMERA PULLS BACK as Prew stands
          up, holding the weapon. The rest of the men are still working
          over their rifles, Maggio is staring up at Prew in awe.
          Henderson grabs the rifle from Prew, turns his back to him,
          pretending to squint along barrel.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT HENDERSON
          looking along barrel. SHOT FEATURES his thumb as he flips the
          rear sight to one side. Henderson turns around and ANGLE
          WIDENS to include Prew. He throws the rifle at Prew, who
          catches it, staggering back.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           Your rear sight's way off! You'd be
           fifty feet off your target at three
           hundred yards!

           rifle.
                          (TO PREW)
           You better get down to the track
           and carry it around a few times.
           Maybe that'll teach you...

          GROUP SHOT BAYONET PRACTICE
          The platoon is divided into teams of two. Thornhill is the
          instructor. This is actual hand-to-hand training. Prew wields
          his rifle, bayonet fixed, in expert thrusts. Maggio is
          fighting in next lane. Thornhill walks behind Prew, trips him
          quickly as he passes. Prew falls off balance. His opponent
          smashes his rifle against Prew's, knocks it to the ground.
          Prew whirls on Thornhill in protest.
                         
                          THORNHILL

          TRUCKING SHOT OUTSIDE SUPPLY ROOM
          Maggio and Prew trudge wearily along the porch, rifles on
          shoulders. Their sweaty uniforms are plastered to their
          bodies.

          As they come up to the Supply Room, Warden, neat and cool, is
          leaning on the counter. He steps aside to let them pass,
          beams at Prew.
                         
                          WARDEN

          Maggio gives Warden a dirty look. Prew's expression is
          noncommittal. They carry their rifles into the Supply Room.
          Leva comes up to the door as Warden turns to go back to the
          Orderly Room. As he does, Karen's convertible comes down the
          street. Warden stops, watches it.
                         
          LONG SHOT FROM WARDEN'S POV

          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES
          It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the
          office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on
          his trench coat. He wears a happy smile.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I won't be back in time to take
           Retreat.

           All work and no play, Sergeant. All
           you do is sit around sweating over
           this paper and that. There are
           other things in this world beside
           work.
                         
          Warden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk.

          Warden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes'
          desk.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I've been considering it.
                         
          He turns aside as Holmes straightens up.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Well, I'm going.
                         
          He claps Warden on the back fraternally.
                         
                          HOLMES

          Holmes goes out. Warden turns back to Holmes' desk. He is
          still holding the papers in one hand. He looks at Karen's
          picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it,
          considering the chances very, very carefully.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI
          raincoat. He is squinting at the door with the same
          expression he used looking at Karen's picture. He takes a
          deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then
          knocks briskly. A shadow moves across the room behind the
          curtains. Then Karen opens the door. She is in shorts and a
          blouse.

          I haven't the slightest idea.
          Perhaps he's in town. I guess it
          was `in town' the way you put it,
          wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the
          Club. Having a drink.

          Karen finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen,

          The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a
          whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink,
          puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks.
          Karen sits on a high kitchen stool.
                         
                          KAREN
           You're taking an awful chance, you

           off.
                         
          He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair.
                         
                          KAREN
           You think of everything, don't you,

                          WARDEN
           Yes. But not important they get
           signed today. Tomorrow's okay.
                         
          Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. Then
          she tears them into bits and throws them into the
          wastebasket. Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the
          first time. He grins widely.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I got carbons of those back at the
           office. So it won't be much work to
           fix them up.
                         
          Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now. She is
          losing her poise.
           29.

           That's what I like about you,

           also what I dislike about you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It's not confidence. It's honesty.

           Honesty? How did you acquire such
           an old-fashioned virtue?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I figgered out one day it was the
           shortest distance between two
           points.
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, he's clever as well as
           virile.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No -- it's just that I hate to see
           a beautiful woman goin all to
           waste.
                         
          He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her.
          Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. During
          next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her
          hand. Her tone is no longer brittle. It is bitter.
                         
                          KAREN
           Waste, did you say? Now that's a
           subject I might tell you something
           about. There's we. And then there's
           waste. Positive and negative. The
           negative is sometimes more
           interesting... more evil. For
           example -- what about the house
           without a child? Tell me your
           thoughts, Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You're going to cry.
                         
                          KAREN
           Not if I can help it.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Please don't cry... I can't stand
           to see somebody cry.
           30.
                         
                         
                         
          Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about
          to put it on.
                         
                          KAREN
           What are you doing?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm leaving. Isn't that what you
           want?
                         
                          KAREN
                          (SLOWLY)
           I don't know, Sergeant. To be
           honest, I don't know.
                         
          They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little
          afraid of their emotions. This is something neither had
          counted on.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I know a beach near Diamond Head.
           Nobody ever goes there. The cars on
           the highway pass above and they
           never know it's there. You feel
           like you used to feel when you were
           a kid, hiding by yourself in a
           cave, watching the others hunting
           you.
                         
          Karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in
          the cabinet.
                         
                          KAREN
           Maybe... why not?
                         
                          WARDEN
           How about Payday?
                         
          Karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure. She is
          unsmiling again.
                         
                          KAREN
           You don't have to spend money on
           me, Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I just like to have some on me when
           I take out a woman. Can you get
           away?
                         
                          KAREN
           Maybe.
           31.
                         
                         
                         
          Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. He goes to the door
          to the pantry, pauses there.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine
           o'clock. Payday.
                         
          Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the
          pantry. A moment later the sound of the door is heard as he
          leaves the house. She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse,
          the glasses they have used. Suddenly she turns the faucet on
          full force, watches it pound into the sink.
                         
           FADE OUT.

          MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES GALOVITCH THORNHILL WILSON DHOM HENDERSON
          The men are grouped around Holmes. He is pressing hard to
          pretend equanimity. The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but
          determined.
                         
                          HOLMES
           -- this man Prewitt's been here
           over a month now. I expected you
           mend have him around before this.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           We've been runnin him pretty hard.
           But he don't faze.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Maybe he needs a good dose of The
           Treatment.
                         
          The men react to the phrase; The Treatment is obviously
          reserved for very special, intractable cases. They consider
          it silently for a moment or two.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           A double dose needs him to be
           given.

           You understand. I don't want
           any rough stuff.

           good leaders. And good leaders --
                         
          The music of the forthcoming MONTAGE drowns Holmes' words as
          he continues.

                         EFFECT MONTAGE
          The MONTAGE consists of a continuous stream of SUPERIMPOSURES
          depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the
          hands of the non-corns. Mingling with the background shots
          are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the
          sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way
          to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear
          stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for
          the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by
          MUSIC. The MONTAGE can be selected and created from the
                         FOLLOWING:

          Joy in baiting Prew.
                         
                         FLASHES PREW

                         OBSTACLE COURSE
          with the platoon going through, crouched low, live ammunition
          spattering around them. Prew, nearest camera, is lower than
          any man in the line. Over shot we hear a snatch of Wilson's
          Voice yelling at Prew to get lower.
                         
          CLOSE FLASH WILSON AND PREW
          Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle
          course.

          the obstacle course. Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms
          yelling "Keep it downs", "Get that nose in the mud!", etc.
          Prew is utterly spent. His face drops into the mud, which
          splatters up, obscuring the screen.

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking
          pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot
          faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE
          WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile
          of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says
          something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. The faucet
          drowns the words.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G.
          Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP.
          Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess
          halls, carrying large trays.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT STARK
          The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene
          possessively. Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a
          soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost
          dropping his loaded tray in his haste.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL
          A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large
          kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the
          potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long
          fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion,
          misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           Ah+m suppose to be a automatic
           rifle man, not a spud-cutter.

           to do would be holler war at you
           and it'd be over the hill and far
           away.

          He is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time.
          He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND WILLARD
          The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says
          as he dumps more pans before Prew. However, he is obviously
          complaining that Prew is slow. Prew, sweating and angry,
          barks something back at him and turns the faucet off.
                         
                          PREW
           No cook ever used that many panel

           couple more arms?!
                         
          Stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. Willard sees
          him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit.
                         
                          WILLARD
           All I ask is that you keep the pans
           washed up so they're clean when I
           need them. In order that I am
           allowed to cook the kind of food
           required for men who work hard all
           day and who need good nourishing
           food to get their nourishment.
                         
                          STARK
           Hole up 'at noise. This man's hot
           as a forty-five shootin downhill.

                          (TERRIBLY INJURED)
           How you think I can do my job if
           the Mess Sergeant takes sides with
           a goldbricking KP? What do you
           think I am?

           cook.
                         
          As Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall.
          Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of
          him.

          Maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden,
          who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. He carries a
          dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry
          table. He is grinning lovingly toward Prew. He strolls over
          to Prew. He eats through following. The smile never leaves
          his face, broadens as the scene progresses.
                         
                          WARDEN

           I didn't say you minded it, kid. I

           Well, well, there's a man for you.
           I'll see if I can fix you up with a
           lot more since you like it so much.
           How you like the garbage detail?
                         
                          PREW

           Guess the best thing to do is leave
           you right in the kitchen a while,
           huh?
                         
          He pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back.
                         
                          WARDEN

           you and Dynamite and The Treatment.
           I'm twice the man you are. If you
           dint have them stripes I'd take you
           out on the green and beat you to a

           Don't let the stripes worry you,

           off. Take it off right now.
                         
                          PREW

          Warden looking at Prew's hand. Warden's grin broadens with
          something more than sarcasm. He is 'impressed and pleased by
          Prew's honest anger.
                         
                          WARDEN

           cost you one thin dime next Payday.
                         
          Warden deliberately turns his back and walks off. Prew looks
          after him. CAMERA MOVES IN to FEATURE his hand on the mug. He
          grasps it tighter, then lets it fall back into the soapy

          The bugle is heard over shot. A line of spruced-up men
          stretches through the mess hall. A blanket is spread over a
          table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and
          Mazzioli. In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a
          cigar box filled with silver. He is paying out the man at the
          head of the line.

          Holmes looks them over, then up at the perfect knot in his
          tie. He stares at Prew as if trying to fathom him.
                         
                          HOLMES

          Holmes' hands clench. He seems about to fly into a rage when
          he senses a motion at his side. He turns to see Warden
          looking straight at him. Warden's face has the same
          meaningfully expressionless look as Prew's. Holmes wilts
          before it, turns to Mazzioli.

          Payday night. A gay, noisy jamboree. Soldiers, mostly in

          at bars. Filipinos padding in twos and threes.

          Maggio and Prew, dressed in slacks and Aloha shirts, stand in
          front of what looks like a renovated residence. They give
          evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial
          drinking. The sound of loud piano playing is heard from
          within. A sign over the door reads: NEW CONGRESS CLUB - SOFT
          DRINKS - DANCING - RECREATION - MEMBERS ONLY. The door opens
           39.
                         
                         
          and MRS. KIPFER stands at the threshold. She is a
          sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an
          evening gown with a corsage of orchids. The piano music,
          louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of
          the following. The pianist is hammering out "I Don't Want To
          Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

           Why, it's Angelo Maggio.
                         
          He barges past her through the door. Mrs. Kipfer frowns and
          follows him. Prew shrugs and goes in after her.

          as Prew enters behind Mrs. Kipfer. The vestibule has an old
          South feeling of mustiness and respectability. Maggio is
          handing some bills to ANNETTE, a young, brash-looking girl,
          who sits behind a reception desk.

           condition...
                         
                          MAGGIO
           There. You see. Any time women see
           a soldier, think he's drunk. Why?
           You know why?
                         
                          PREW
           Because he is.
                         
           MRS. KIPPER
           Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
           with the entertainment business.
           Every respectable place must
           consider its future.
                         
                          PREW

          Maggio nods vigorously in agreement, then pushes through the
          heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room
          beyond. Mrs. Kipfer looks after him a little unhappily.
                         
           MRS. KIPPER
           Angelo is one of my favorites.

           gentleman, will you, please?
                         
          Mrs. Kipfer exits through the curtains. Annette takes a card
          from file, picks up pen.

          Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about
          a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen
          hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano
          is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a
          jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs.
          Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy
          themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a
          place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of
          prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all
          but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a
          couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look
          about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low
          on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a
           41.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT "FATSO" JUDSON
          pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out.
          He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles
          Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced
          far apart on a great white plate.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE
          Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very
          tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the
          langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps
          switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of
          the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance
          out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule.
          CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch.

          The girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the
          girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV
          As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from
          the magazine, smiles serenely across the room.

          looking girls talking to a soldier.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           Meet Suzanne and Roxanne.
                         
          The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over
          his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with
          haughty disdain.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           Much as I adore your company, you
           must allow me to tear myself away.
           I see a few friends at the door.
                          (SNAPS)
           Also I can see I will be of no use
           to you much.
           42.
                         
                         
                         
          She walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier.
          Prew continues to gaze across the room.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE
          smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is
          coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before
          her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low-
          pitched, poised.
                         
                          LORENE
           Would you like to sit down?
                         
                          PREW
                          (SITTING)
           Oh... sure.
                         
                          LORENE
           I'm Lorene.
                         
                          PREW
           (enchanted by the name)
           Lorene...
                         
                          LORENE
           I haven't seen you in here before.
                         
          Prew gestures with the membership card.
                         
                          PREW
           I dint know about this place till
           now. A friend of mine brought me.
           We're stationed at Schofield.
                         
                          LORENE
           Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were
           a soldier.
                         
                          PREW
           (bridles a bit)
           Well, I am. And I'm in for the
           whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.
                         
                          LORENE
           I suppose it's different when a
           fellow is going to make a career of
           it.
                         
                          PREW
           There ain't anythin wrong with a
           soljer that ain't wrong with
           everyone else.
                         
          Lorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness.
           43.
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           I like you just the same. I liked
           you the minute I saw Annette
           bringing you in.
                         
                          PREW
                          (MELTS)
           Me, too. I mean when I came in. I
           saw you over here --
                         
          There is a commotion across the room. A group of man and
          girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing
          and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio.
          Prew looks over, concerned.
                         
                          FATSO'S VOICE
           I'll play loud as I want, ya little
           Wop!
                         
          A babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply.
                         
                          PREW
           Friend of mine.
                          (RISES)
           You wait right here for me, will
           ya?
                         
                          LORENE
                          (SMILES SWEETLY)
           Surely.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO
          where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are
          restraining Maggio. The others are amused by the quarrel, but
          Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull
           you apart!
                         
                          FATSO
           You're the kind of character I eat
           for breakfast, ya little --
                         
          Maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but
          Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him. Mrs. Kipfer
          bustles into the melee.
                         
           MRS. KIPFER
           Now, you gentlemen know I will not
           have any of this sort of thing.

                          FATSO
           Little Mussolini here tryin to tell
           me what way to play the piano.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust
           already with that noise!
                         
           MRS. KIPFER
           You man can simply leave if you're
           not going to behave yourselves.

          MEDIUM SHOT AT SIDE OF ROOM
          where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           (has been watching)
           You know who that guy is, buddy?
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Sure, I know who he is. Whadda I
           care?
                         
                          PREW
           Who is he?
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Fatso Judson. Sergeant of the Guard
           at the Post Stockade.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FATSO JUDSON
          settling down at the piano again. He glances over in
          direction of Maggio with a mean smile. Then he starts to
          hammer the keys viciously.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO PEW SOLDIER
          as the music starts, Maggio stiffens, turns as if to go back.
          Prew holds tight, to his arm.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           -- I'm tellin you, leave him be.
           Nets danger. I seen him nearly
           murder a guy once. He likes it.
           45.
                         
                         
                         
          Sandra comes over, disengages Prew's arm from Maggio's, puts
          her own around him.
                         
                          SANDRA
           All right, bully boy, now you won
           the war, let's dance.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (beginning to quiet down)
           First I got to calm my nerves. Come
           on with me to a phone booth or some
           thin.
           (slaps himself on belly)
           Where I will unveil this fifth of
           whisky I got under this loose
           flowing sports shirt.
                         
          He and Sandra start off toward an adjoining room. Prew
          smiles, turns back toward Lorene. The smile fades.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FROM PREW'S POV
          Lorene is looking at another soldier, on the couch beside
          her, with her rapt, innocent expression.

          HOLDS on MEDIUM SHOT as he comes up to her and the soldier, a
          talkative man named BILL.
                         
                          BILL
           -- you go along as fast as forty
           miles per through that surf and
           your balance has got to be letter
           perfect.
                         
                          PREW
           Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.
                         
                          LORENE
           (looks up, smiles)
           Bill here was telling me about
           surfboarding.
                         
                          BILL
           Hello, friend.
                         
                          LORENE
                          (PATS COUCH)
           Sit down and just listen. He
           describes it thrillingly.
                         
          Prew sits down, disgruntled. Bill notes his expression.
           46.
                         
                         
                         
                          BILL
           You know anything about
           surfboarding?
                         
                          PREW
           No. Nothing. Not a thing.
                         
                          BILL
           You must be stationed inland then.
           I'm at DeRussey so I get lots of
           chances.
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah? But then we got mountains.
           You know anything about mountain
           climbing?
                         
                          BILL
           A little bit. Are you a mountain
           climber?
                         
                          PREW
           No. You know anything about flying
           an airplane?
                         
          Lorene is frowning now.
                         
                          BILL
           I've had a few lessons.
                         
                          PREW
           Well, I can't fly either. What
           do you know about deep sea diving?
                         
                          LORENE
           Do you want to move into another
           room, Bill?
                         
                          BILL
           Sure. The air in here seems to have
           gotten very smelly, hasn't it?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah, I noticed that, too --
                         
                          BILL
           Listen, fellow --
                         
                          LORENE
           Shall we go, then?

          She and Bill rise. She smiles tremulously at him as she takes
          his arm and they start off. She throws a severe glance over
          her shoulder at Prew.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          He settles lower in the couch, the picture of frustration and
          hopelessness. He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights
          it.
                         
          EXT. KUHIO PARK - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PARK BENCH
          Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill
          at ease. There is Payday activity here also; amorous
          strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups.
          Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her. She is about to
          get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over
          her. His civilian suit is neat and well-cut. Both are
          strained, awkward, antagonistic. Now that the step has been
          taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.
                         
                          KAREN
           Why, hello. I didn't think you were
           coming.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Why not? I'm not late.
                         
                          KAREN
           No, I guess you're not. But then I
           came a little early. I must have
           been overanxious. You weren't
           overanxious though, were you? You
           got here right on the dot.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I'd of been early too only I
           stopped to get a drink.
                         
                          KAREN
           You certainly chose a savory spot
           for our meeting.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Would you rather it'd been the
           cocktail lounge of the Royal?
                         
                          KAREN
           No, but I've had five chances to be
           picked up in the last few minutes.

           (sits beside her on the
                          BENCH)
           That's par for the course around
           here.
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, I don't care for it. I never
           went in much for back-alley loving.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Didn't you?
                         
                          KAREN
           You probably think I'm a tramp,
           don't you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           What makes you think I'd think
           that?
                         
                          KAREN
           Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.
           If you think this is a mistake,
           come right out and say so.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (OUTRAGE)
           Listen, what started all this,
           anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like
           a school kid out with teacher!
           Where'd I come up with a yen for of
           all things the Compny Commander's
           wife! And her actin like Lady
           Astor's horse all because I only
           got here on time!
                         
          Warden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into
          laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in.
                         
                          KAREN
           On the other hand, I've got a
           bathing suit under my dress.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It
           parked around the corner.
                         
          He takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera.
          They merge with the other couples in the little park.

          MEDIUM SHOT COUCH
          Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He
          stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees
          someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene
          comes into shot, looks down at him.
                         
                          PREW
           How's the surfboard rider?
                         
                          LORENE
           That was a terrible way to have
           acted. What you did.
                         
                          PREW
           I was jealous.
                         
                          LORENE
                          (LAUGHS)
           You're a funny one.
                         
                          PREW
           What do you dames want? To take
           the heart out of a man and tie it
           up in barbed wire?
                         
                          LORENE
           (angry because she really
                          LIKES PREW)
           Now, look here, what do you think
           Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're
           hired to be nice to all the boys.
           They're all alike. Is it so
           important?
                         
                          PREW
                          (STANDS; URGENTLY)
           Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem
           all alike but none of us is ever
           all alike.
                          (PAUSE)
           All right, I'm sorry about before.
                         
                          LORENE
           (touched by his outburst)
           That piano is about to drive me out
           of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs.
           Kipfer's suite and sit there. She
           lets us use it sometimes... for
           somebody special.
                         
                          PREW
           Are you mad?

                          LORENE
           No, I'm not mad.
                         
                          PREW
           Because if you're still mad I'd
           just rather we called the whole
           thing off.
                         
                          LORENE
           (takes his arm)
           You certainly are a funny one.
                         
          They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the
          room.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          FULL SHOT WAVE
          sweeping over camera, spray flying.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH
          A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the
          moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire
          about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping
          out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of
          GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter
          in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky
          longingly, happily.
                         
                          KAREN
           I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope
           I freeze in a solid chunk.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (sudden, intense laugh)
           Just so long's you melt afterwards.
                         
                          KAREN
           I love the way you laugh.
                         
          He stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the
          water. He runs after her.
                         
          FULL SHOT WAVE
          near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The
          wave washes over them.

          MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN
          CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft
          chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several
          moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate
          laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch,
          their heads close together as if they have just kissed
          pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is
          on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender
          feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g.
          A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around
          Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with
          something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no
          effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a
          conversation.
                         
                          LORENE
           ... I enlisted, too. I came out
           here on my own. To get away from my
           home town. In Oregon.
                         
                          PREW
           How come?
                         
                          LORENE
           I had a boy friend. I was a
           waitress. He was from the richest
           family in town. He just married the
           girl suitable for his position.
           After three years of going around
           with me.
                          (PAUSE)
           It's a pretty story, isn't it?
           Maybe they could make a movie of
           it.
                         
                          PREW
           They did. Ten thousand of them.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Lorene smiles.
                         
                          LORENE
           So I left and went to Seattle, as a
           waitress. And I met a girl just
           back from Hawaii. She said she'd
           made a lot of money working for
           Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first
           boat. I've been here a year and two
           months.
                         
                          PREW
           You like it much?
           52.
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           Oh, I don't like it. But I don't
           mind it. Anyway, I won't be here
           forever.
                         
                          PREW
           No. Sure not. I mean, why should
           you?
                         
                          LORENE
           I have it all figured out. In
           another year I'll be back home,
           with a pile of bills big enough to
           choke a steer. And then I will be
           all set for life --
                         
          There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL
          as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its
          hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment,
          Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is
          grinning like an amateur conspirator.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I dint hear no sounds of combat. So
           I figgered maybe you'd like a
           drink.
                         
                         THREE SHOT
          as Maggio comes into the room.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Or otherwise old Sandra would of
           drank it all by herself. She's a
           fine girl. But she drinks like a
           fish.
                         
          There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets
          three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them.
                         
                          LORENE
           No, thanks. I never drink much.
                         
          Maggio stops short of the third glass. He takes a big gulp
          from the first.
                         
                          LORENE
           I think it' a a weakness.
                         
                          MAGGIO
                          (ANOTHER GULP)
           I grant you that.
           53.
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           And I don't like weakness.
                          (TO PREW) )
           Do you?
                         
                          PREW
           No. I don't like weakness.
           (rises, takes a drink)
           But I like to drink.
                         
          He comes back to the divan.
                         
                          LORENE
           With you it's not a weakness. With
           you it's more like a virtue.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           That sounds like a very profound
           remark. Maybe that's why I don't
           get it.
                         
                          LORENE
           (snuggles to Prew)
           Well, it's so.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Hey! What you gonna do, marry this
           guy? Way you grinnin at him you
           look like his wife!
                         
                          PREW
           Get outa here!
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (picks up bottle)
           Okay. Back to old long-legged
           Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and
           acres.
                         
          He goes out, closing door behind him. Suddenly the door opens
          again and Maggio pops back in. He puts the whisky bottle on a
          table next to the door.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it
           more than me. You be back with The
           Treatment tomorrow.
                         
          He pops out again, the door closing after him. Prew's gaiety
          dims with the reference to The Treatment. Lorene sees this.
          Prew rises, goes to whisky bottle.
           54.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           That was nice before. The way you
           snuggled up. In front of him.
                         
                          LORENE
           What's he mean, The Treatment?
                         
          Prew doesn't answer. He pours a drink, gulps it.
                         
                          LORENE
           What did he mean?
                         
                          PREW
           Some of the guys puttin me over the
           jumps because I won't fight.

           Fight?
                         
                          PREW
           On the boxing team. I don't want to
           fight! I don't want to talk about
           it! I don't want to think about it.
           And they make me think about it.
           Every day.
                         
          He drops down on the divan beside her.
                         
                          PREW
           It's a personal thing...
                         
          His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his
          overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand.
                         
                          PREW
           Over at Port Shafter... I used to
           fight... Middleweight. I was pretty
           good. I used to work out with Dixie
           Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he
           was fast... And good. He loved
           boxing. He was gonna come out of
           the Army and go right into the
           upper brackets... People on the
           Outside had their eye on him.
           (rises, paces)
           Dixie didn't want, to use the six
           ounce gloves this time. And we
           neither of us wore headgear,
           anyway. I was set flat on my feet
           when I caught Dixie wide with this
           no more than ordinary solid cross.
           Dixie just happened to be standing
           solid, too.

                          PREW(CONT'D)
           (sits on chair)
           From the way he fell I knew. Dead
           weight, square on his face. He dint
           roll over. He was in a coma a week.
           Then he finally came out of it. The
           only thing was that he was blind...
           (rises, paces)
           I went up to the hospital to see
           him. Twice. Then I couldn't go
           back. We got to talking about
           fighting the second time. And Dixie
           cried... Seein tears comin out of
           those eyes that couldn't see...
                         
          There are tears on Prew's face. He turns away from Lorene.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING FROM BEHIND PREW
          Lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her
          hand on his shoulder. Prew does not turn but his hand grasps
          hers. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of the hands.
                         
          EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE
          A wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into
          shore. CAMERA PANS with them as they walk out of the water,
          hand in hand. They stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse.
          He swings her to him and kisses her.
                         
                         CLOSEUP
          as they kiss. The embrace is impassioned. When their lips
          separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight
          to something they find is more than sex alone.
                         
                         EXTREME CLOSEUP
          as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen
          before and which he normally takes great pains to hide.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
          as their lips separate again.
                         
                          KAREN
           Nobody ever kissed me that way...
           not really...
                         
          They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to
          the kisses. The jump to banter is a quick defense.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Nobody?
                         
          CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they walk to the fire. Karen smiles
          at him.
           56.
                         
                         
                         
                          KAREN
           No. Nobody.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Not even one? Out of all the many
           men you've been kissed by?
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, that will take some figuring.
           How many men do you think there've
           been?
                         
          CAMERA HOLDS as they sit, beside the fire. Karen wraps one of
          the blankets around her.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I wouldn't know. Can't you even
           make me a rough estimate?
                         
                          KAREN
           Not without an adding machine. Do
           you have your adding machine with
           you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, I forgot to bring it.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then I guess you won't find out,
           will you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I already know.
                         
          The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the
          questions and answers now.
                         
                          KAREN
           What's the matter? What are you
           hinting at?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Why? Is there something to hint at?
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe
           you just think there's a lot.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a
           long line of beach parties --
           57.
                         
                         
                         
                          KAREN
           You must be crazy -- !
                         
                          WARDEN
           Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here.
           But what about when you and Holmes
           were at Fort Bliss?
                         
          Karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up,
          raging. She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head,
          wriggles into it.
                         
                          KAREN
           I had to go and forget you were a
           man -- with the same rotten filthy
           mind the rest of them have. For a
           minute I had to convince myself you
           were different --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Only it's true, ain't it?
                         
                          KAREN
           Yes, it's true! A part of it, some
           small part of whatever sewage
           you've been listening to. Some day
           perhaps you'll get all the story.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (YAPS UP)
           All what story?
                         
                          KAREN
           You're getting to sound so much
           like a typical male. So you just
           sweat it out like a typical male.
                         
          She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking
          fast, then almost running. Warden runs after her.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS
          as Warden catches up with Karen. He grasps her arm roughly,
          hauls her down onto the sand. He stares at her bitterly,
          waiting f or her to speak.
                         
                          KAREN
           All right. I've never told it to
           anyone before. But I think now is
           the time. I'll tell you the whole
           bloody messy thing. You can take it
           back to the barracks with you.
           58.
                         
                         
                         
          She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the
          story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across
          the moon.
                         
                          KAREN
           I'd been married to Captain Dana E.
           Holmes two years. Only he was a
           First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort
           Bliss. We lived right on a little
           lake where we could fish and swim
           and be alone, our 'dream
           cottage'... I'm sure you must be
           able to picture it. It was off on a
           back road, four miles from the
           highway. Two miles from a neighbor
           and a telephone....
           (pauses, then rushes on)
           I hadn't been married long when
           I knew my husband was stepping
           out on me. But -- you get used
           to that. Your mother tells you
           that it's life, that i t happens
           to a lot of women. Of course,
           she doesn't tell you until after
           it happens.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
          reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then, by that time, you're
           pregnant. And at least you've
           something else to hope for. I think
           I was almost happy that night the
           pains began. Even though they were
           weeks too early, a whole month too
           early. I remember Dana was putting
           on that dapper silk gabardine
           uniform he used to wear. He was
           going to an officer's 'seminar.' He
           was kidding me about false labor. I
           didn't think it was humorous. I
           told him to get home early, to
           bring the doctor with him. He
           smiled tenderly and told me about
           the psychic reactions of women to
           pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be
           back early. And maybe he would
           have... if the 'seminar' hadn't
           been with the hat-check girl in one
           of the night clubs.
           59.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           Listen.
                         
                         TWO SHOT
                         
                          KAREN
           He was only a little drunk when he
           came in... at five a.m. He looked
           alarmed when he saw me. I guess it
           was because of my screams. I was
           lying there on the floor, you see --
           No, don't say anything. I'm not
           finished yet. Of course, the baby
           was dead. It was a boy. But they
           worked over me at the hospital and
           fixed me up fine. They even took my
           appendix out, too. They threw that
           in free. It was all fine.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Listen. Listen. Please.
                         
                          KAREN
           And, of course, one more thing no
           more children. Do you know what
           that means? You're not a woman.
           You're not anything. You're a
           gutted shell... Sure, I went out
           with some of the men after that. A
           few months of it. I'd been made
           dirty and I wanted to be clean. You
           can see that, can't you?... Anyway,
           I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on
           living with him.
                         
                          WARDEN
           The hateful, miserable --
                         
                          KAREN
           You hunt so hungrily for love...
           love, if you can find it, you
           think, might give things meaning
           again.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Listens Listen to me --
                         
                          KAREN
           All right. I'm listening.
                         
          Warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love.
          Karen moves closer to him.
           60.
                         
                         
                         
                          KAREN
           I know. Until I met you I didn't
           think it was possible, either.
                         
           FADE OUT.

          PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM
          Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a
          quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in
          all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters,
          talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday
          Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only
          passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly
          sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday,
          the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes.
          Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA
          CONTINUES PANNING, PASSES a soldier reading a newspaper who
          shakes his head and mutters, "... ain't it terrible about Lou
          Gehrig dyin...", then MOVES IN to HOLD on a group at a window
          seat, bulling. Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if
          he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment.
          Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive
          robin. Treadwell slouches at the end of the seat. Pete
          Karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine.

                          PREW
           That's right. Look at Karelsen
           there. Only seven years more for
           rockin chair money.
                         
          Karelsen hears his name, looks over.

           The Profession wears you down,
           though, young man. Down thin like a
           knife what's been honed and honed.
           All that good steel just rubbed
           away...
                         
          He turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING ANDERSON AND CLARK OTHERS IN B.G.
          Anderson peels off a flourish as he and Clark end their song.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           Man, that's blues! Where'd you drag
           that one up Prom?

           Oh, just stumbled on it.
                         
          He strums aimlessly again. Prew and Treadwell come over to
          listen, prop themselves on chairs. During following, several
          others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby
          stops, turns to listen.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment.

          MEDIUM SHOT GROUP
          as Anderson repeats a theme he has happened on. It has a
          haunting melody.
                         
                          CLARK
           Hey, look... I betcha we could make
           one out of what you just played. Do
           that again.
                         
          Anderson repeats the melody.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I could bring it down to a third
           line major ending... Regular twelve
           bars blues.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           I bet I got two hundred blues

           But there ain't one could touch
           that. And that includes Saint
           Louis. And it could be ours...
                         
          The men wear pleased smiles, delighted by the idea of
          possessing something quite rare and truly their own. Prew
          flips his cigarette into a can.
                         
                          PREW
           I got it. We call it the `Re-
           enlistment Blues'!
                         
          There is a chorus of approval.
                         
                          PREW
           Lookit, w e could start it with the
           guy getting discharged.
           (reaches over to desk)
           Hey, fella, can I use this?
                         
          The soldier at the desk nods, and Prew takes his pencil and
          paper. He writes down the words of the song as they are
          composed during following.
                         
                          PREW
           How's this? 'Got paid out on
           Monday... Not a dog soljer no
           more... They gimme all that
           money....'
                         
          He stops, stuck. Anderson plays the melody and Prew sings the
          words to this point. Friday Clark chimes in suddenly.
                         
                          CLARK
           'They gimme all that money... So
           much my pockets is sore...'
                         
          They laugh. Anderson sings. Prew writes furiously.
                         
                          ANDERSON

          Anderson plays a series of chords, then repeats the last two

                         FULL SHOT
          Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. On
          the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of
          the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center
          of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes
          hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor.
          There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above
          his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope.
          In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.
                         
                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE
           Some day you get sense in your dumb
           head, Prewitt, you be up here
           instead down there!
                         
          A fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over
          Prew but he keeps about his work.
                         
                          WILSON
           Still makin out you like it, huh?
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT IN RING
          There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one
          of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty
          water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Clean up dis mess, Prewitt!
                         
          Prew gets to his feet. Galovitch resumes skipping rope.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           And look a life, hurry it up. You
           on fatigue detail, not vacation.
                         
          Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab
          up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch
          "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Clean up, Prewitt!
                         
          Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. He
          throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor.
                         
                          PREW
           Clean it up yourself!

           How? What!
                         
                          PREW
           You heard me -- rub your own nose
           in it a while!
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           What!
                         
          Prew starts out of the ring. Holmes intercepts him.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What's the matter with you,
           Prewitt? You know better than to
           talk back to a non-commissioned
           officer.
                         
                          PREW
           Yes, sir. But I have never liked
           being spit at, sir. Even by a non-
           commissioned officer.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch
           an apology.
                         
                          PREW
                          (RECKLESSLY)
           I don't think I owe him no apology.
           In fact, I think one's owed to me.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (FURIOUS)
           Sergeant Galovitch, take this man
           to the barracks and have him roll a
           full field pack, extra shoes,
           helmet and all, and then take a
           bicycle and hike him up to Kole-
           Kole Pass and back. And see that he
           hikes all the way. And when he gets
           back, bring him to me.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Yes, Sirr.
                         
          Prew climbs out of the ring, Galovitch following him.

          Par below in the shot are Prew, hiking, and Galovitch, riding
          behind him on the bicycle. The dirt road is steep and the sun
          pours down, steaming hot.
                         
          MOVING SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods
          along. He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's
          bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's
          heels.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Move along. You not half way yet.
           Three more miles to top.
                         
          A jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and
          moves down the road. It slows its speed and pulls up when it
          nears Prew and Galovitch.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is
          MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and
          Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the
          vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of
          the two men.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
           At ease. Where're you men headed?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Top of pass, Sir. This man
           insubordinate. The Captain is
           teaching him lesson.

          The General, still frowning slightly, nods. He signals his
          driver to move on. The jeep starts down the road. Galovitch
          gets on his bicycle. Prew starts hiking again.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's
          desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his
          face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He
          has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung
          his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks
           66.
                         
                         
          Prew up and down, half-smiles.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I take it you're ready to apologize
           to Sergeant Galovitch now.
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir, I'm not.
                         
          Holmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Take him back up there again,
           Galovitch. He hasn't had enough

           Yes, air.
                         
          Prew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G.
          Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose
          back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES
          Holmes slams his fist on his desk.
                         
                          HOLMES
           1 know that kind of man! He's an
           againster. A bitter-ender. You
           can't be decent to a man like that.
           You have to tame him, like an
           animal!
                          (TO WARDEN)
           Warden, I want you to prepare court
           martial papers. Insubordination and
           insolence to an officer.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          Warden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several
          moments, tries to sound quite casual.
                         
                          WARDEN

           middleweight like that...
                         
                          HOLMES
           Why? Do you see any other way of
           breaking him?

                          WARDEN
           I don't know... But even if he only
           gets three months, he'll still be
           in the Stockade when the boxing
           finals come up.
                         
          He looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening.
                         
                          WARDEN
           How about just giving him a good
           stiff Compny punishment for now?
                         
          Holmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over
          his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much
          for him.
                         
                          HOLMES
           All right, all right. But throw the
           book at him.

          He is trimming his moustache.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm sick of it! They ain't got no
           right to keep breakin it off in
           that kid! Sooner later Holmes is
           going to hound him right into the
           Stockade!
                         
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room,
          undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering,
          using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes
          to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm through! I'm turnin in my

           leaving all my old buddies.
                         
          Karelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around
          his middle. He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden
          clogs, starts slowly for the door.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY
          An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long
          white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered
          robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we
          hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and
          shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo
          Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white-
          aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him,
          DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement
          walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called
          decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from
          Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer
          and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door
          sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At
          a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are
          Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate.

           The Canal Zone for me. This girl
           down there. She was a planter's
           daughter, see. She lived a very
           sheltered life. A very moral young
           lady, Milt. I took her out to a
           high class dinner and then dancing.
           It was a great shock to her to
           learn about life. But she took it
           well. She got to like me very much
           after that.

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from
          home, spreading them out on the table. Mazzioli is talking to
          Prew with great earnestness.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           ... it's in regulations. You've got

           right to take your case to the
           Inspector General. Any soldier has,
           even a plain dogface.
                         
                          PREW
           I know it. I'm not complainin to
           nobody. They ain't goin to get the
           satisfaction of seein me squirm.
                         
          Clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox
          music, noodling an uninspired obligato.

           to tell you but --. Warden hasn't
           had you on KP much lately, has he?

                          MAZZIOLI
           Well -- I was working in the
           Orderly Room this afternoon and I
           heard the Captain telling Warden
           you're to pull KP every weekend
           from now on. You know what that
           means -- you can' t even go into
                          TOWN --

           Whadda they want? They done

           a box! What else they gonna try?
                         
          Clark hits a sour note an the bugle.

           bugle!?
                         
          In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle
          away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the
          mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his
          own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music.
                         
          FULL SHOT CHOY'S
          as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the
          room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns
          toward Prew.

          reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music.

          as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend

          ANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW
          Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly
          as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in
           71.
                         
                         
          all. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now,
          the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR
          The room is quiet for several moments, except for the
          continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now.
          Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men
          see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between
          tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the
          men turn back to their beer.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to
          look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture,
          a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly
          in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.

          Fatso whistles. He picks up the photograph, stares at it,
          whistles again.
                         
                          FATSO
           Whoever! Say, she's a real good
           piece of whistle bait! I'd sure
           like to get my mitts around her.
                         
          He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on
          the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the
          heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down
          on Fatso's head with all his strength,
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops
          abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but
          does not go down.
                         
                          FATSO

           (still blinking from the
                          BLOW)
           What?! But what for? That's no way
           to fight!
           (reaches hand to head,
           brings away blood)
           Why, you dirty yellow sneaking --
           Wop! You yellow little Wop! If
           that's the way you want to play!
                         
          With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps
          open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It
          glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking
          intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots
          face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN)
          Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso
          advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them.
                         
                          SOLDIER'S VOICE
           Hey, it you want to fight, fight
           with fists. Take it outsides
                         
          There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of
          men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them.
                         
                          FATSO
           I'm gonna cut this little Wop's
           heart out. Anybody steps in here, I
           give it to him first.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY
          side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes
          almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO
          Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table
          as the other stalks him.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (scared but brave; shouts)
           I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso!
           One step closer an I'm gunna kill
           ya!
                         
          Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike.
          Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle
          wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.
           73.

           killin anybody around here, it'll
           be me!
                         
          Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one
          in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio.
                         
                          FATSO
           Look outs here, Warden. This a
           private affair.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No it ain't! This man's in my
           Compny an I'm responsible for him.
           And you ain't makin two weeks extra
           paper work for me by killin him.
           Nor him you. Put that knife down!
                         
          He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the
          wagged edge at Fatso, roars:
                         
                          WARDEN
           Put it down!
                         
          Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it
          pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns
          his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on,
           you want some killing, come on!
           (whirls on Fatso)
           Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you
           comin?
                         
          Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (with mammoth contempt)
           Killers! You'll get plenty of
           killing, all right. More than you
           got the stomach for. You'll be in a
           war one of these days. When you
           feel that lead from a sniper's
           rifle hit you between the eyes,
           come and tell me how you like it.
           Killers!
           (turns to Maggio)
           Now put down that chair.
                         
          Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso.
           74.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           Throw that knife on the floor.
                         
          Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is
          another audible whoosh of breath from the room.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Almost scared there wasn't anybody
           going to stop you for a minute,
           weren't you?
           (finally lowers his voice)
           Is there any other little things
           you punks'd like me to take care of
           for you?
                         
          He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his
          own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has
          broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing
          Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.
                         
                          FATSO
           Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys
           like you get to the Stockade sooner
           later. One day you walk in there
           I'll be waitin. I'll show you a
           coupla things.
                         
          He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE
          Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied
          as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises
          his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He
          half-whispers to Prew.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I made a mistake I guess, but I
           don't see how I could of done
           anything else, after that big stoop
           said a thing like that.
                         
          Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.
                         
                          PHEW
           I'll tell you your mistake. You
           didn't hit him hard enough to put
           him out.
           75.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I hit him hard as I could. His head
           must be solid ivory.
                         
          In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards
          the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it.
           He's a good man, you know it?
                         
          As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out.
                         
          EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the
          entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him
          off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to
          him.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction
          to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating
          heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence
          and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty.
                         
                          PREW
           ... That was a near thing.
                         
                          WARDEN
           ... Yeah.
                         
          Prew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get
          control of himself; he manages a weak smile.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You keep it, kid. Keep it for a
           souvenir.
                         
          Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another
          a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express
          some deep emotion of respect.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You ain't enjoying life much, are
           you, kid?
           76.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
                          (THIN SMILE)
           They can kill you but they can't
           eat you, Top.
                         
          Warden studies Prew thoughtfully. Prew turns to go back into
          Choy's.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Prewitt.
                         
          Prew stops, turns back.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Could you stand a weekend pass?
                         
          Prew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to
          find his voice.
                         
                          PREW
           I thought --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You thought what, kid?
                         
                          PREW
           How about Dynamite?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most
           anything I put in front of him
           `thout readies it.
                         
          Though Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say
          "thanks"; Warden grins broadly at him.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I hear you gone dippy over some
           dame you met at the New Congress
           Club.
                         
          He slaps Prew on the shoulder roughly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What'd you say her name was?
                         
                          FREW
           Lorene...
                         
                          WARDEN
           Pretty name.
           77.
                         
                         
                         
          Warden walks off across the street. Prew stares after him.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - DAY
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW AND LORENE
          Lorene is covering Prew with sand and has him almost
          completely buried. Only his face remains uncovered. He is
          griming up at her. She seems thoughtful.
                         
                          PREW
           ... Lorene...
                         
          She throws a towel over his face. He chuckles under it.
                         
                          LORENE
           My name's Alma.
                         
          The chuckle from under the towel dies.
                         
                          LORENE
           Alma Schmidt...
                         
          There is a sound as of strangling from under the towel.
                         
                          LORENE
           Mrs. Kipfer picked Lorene out of a
           perfume ad. She thought it sounded
           French...
                         
          Lorene whisks the towel away. Prew's face is comic in its
          surprise and chagrin.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT BAR ALMA AND PREW
          (NOTE: From this point on "ALMA" will be used instead of
          "LORENE.")
          A fashionable Waikiki night spot. An orchestra in b.g, is
          playing "Someone's Rocking My Dream Boat." Alma and Prew are
          seated at the bar. She is dressed modestly and becomingly,
          might well be taken as a society girl. Prew is wearing a
          civilian suit; he looks bound and choked in it.
                         
                          PREW
           Alma...
                         
          She smiles ruefully, realizes her real name has rubbed off
          some of the enchantment.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
          No, honest, I like it. Alma's a --
          swell name. It was great you gettin
          away today.
                         
                          ALMA
          I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick. But
          I bet she doesn't believe it,
                         
                          PREW
          There's no tellin when I'll get
          into town next. The Warden gave me
          a break this time. But Holmes and
          those others, they got me on the
          edge. I just about went off the
          deep end the other day.
                         
                          ALMA
          You must hate the Army.
                         
                          PREW
          Hate the Army...?
                         
                          ALMA
          Sure. Look what it's doing to you.
                         
                          PREW
          It's not the Army that's doing it.
          It's Man. I love the Army.
                         
                          ALMA
          Love it? Well, it sure doesn't love
          you in return.
                         
                          PREW
          When you love something it doesn't
          mean they got to love you in
          return.
                         
                          ALMA
          Yes, but a person can stand just so
          much from something --
                         
                          PREW
          No! A man loves a thing, he's gotta
          be grateful.
           (pauses, gropes for
                          THOUGHTS)
          I left home when I was seventeen.
          Both my folks was dead, then. I
          bummed around. I got all sorts of
          jobs. I rode the rods.

                          PREW(CONT'D)
           I landed in jails. I didn't belong
           nowhere. Until I entered the
           Profession.
                         
          She frowns, not understanding the last word.
                         
                          PREW
           The Army. I enlisted at Fort Myer
           and I learned how to box and I
           learned how to play a bugle. I
           never had much call for the boxing -
           - but if it weren't for the Army
           I'd never of learned how to play a
           bugle.
                         
                          ALMA
           A bugle?
                         
          Prew nods. He takes the mouthpiece out of his pocket, shows
          it to her.
                         
                          PREW
           This is the mouthpiece I used to
           play a Taps at Arlington.
                         
          Alma takes the mouthpiece, looks it over, seems unimpressed.
                         
                          PREW
           (as if saying "I was
                          ELECTED PRESIDENT")
           They picked me to play a Taps -- at

           Look. Think. You ever think how
           strange a tree would look to one
           who had never lived upon the earth?
           Well, somehow that's how I feel
           when I play a bugle...
                         
          There is a boisterous shouting nearby.

          They turn and ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE Maggio, who has just
          come up to the bar. He is in uniform. Prew is pleased to see
          him but also alarmed; there is something near-desperate under
          Maggio's drunkenness.

           the Post. Right away.
                         
          Maggio shakes his head violently in the negative.

          Prew gives him a cigarette. Maggio hops on an empty bar stool
          a few places removed from Prew and Alma.
                         
                          MAGGIO

          A tray on the bar contains olives, nuts and pretzels. Maggio
          snatches up two olives, shakes them in his fist beside his

          Prew, carrying Maggio's clothes, stops as he sees what looks
          like a shadow lying across the bench.

          Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping
          blissfully. He is clothed only in his shorts. Despite
          himself, Prew smiles. He shakes the reclining figure.
                         
                          PREW

          Prew pulls Maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across
          the path away from the light.

          The ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard,
          not far away. Prew looks off.
                         
          LONG SHOT THROUGH BUSHES
          The two MPs are on the street just outside the grounds. They

          MEDIUM SHOT END OF PATH NEAR STREET
          The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew
          about thirty yards away.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PEW AND MAGGIO
          Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and
          runs toward the MPs.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs
          as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, "Can't a man do
          nothin?!" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other,
          directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers
          back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the
          latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but
          instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly.
          In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The
          first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club
          and hits the first MP over the head.

          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G.
          The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He
          smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues
          to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them.

          around the knees and brings him to the ground.

          Prew sees the second MP raise his pistol, point it toward

          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          CAMERA MOVES WITH him close to ground as he knees and elbows
          his way along deep into the bushes. He stops, breathing hard.
          The sound of the MPs fighting with Maggio can be heard, the
          ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing
          bone and flesh.
                         
                          MAGGIO'S VOICE

           knock me out -- no matter --
                         
          Maggio's voice stops suddenly. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSEUP of
          Prew on the ground, his face contorted. The voices of the MPs
          are heard now, panting.
                         
           FIRST MP'S VOICE
           I wonder what was wrong with this

          MEDIUM SHOT PEEN WARDEN MAZZIOLI
          Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. Prew sits
          on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees,
          chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden
          looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board.
          Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a
          window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy
          bar.
                         
                          LEVA
           Any word on Maggio's Court Martial?
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           It's on right now. At Headquarters.
                         
          Lava sits on the bench beside Prew, shakes his head.
                         
                          LEVA
           He'll get the Stockade sure.
                         
          The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if
          he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now
          that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on
          their faces. There is a long pause.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Maybe he won't get it. All he did
           was get drunk and run wild. That's
           a soldier's nature. It's almost his
           sacred duty once in a while.
                         
          There is another pause. Warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at
          Leva.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What you hangin around here for?
                         
                          LEVA
           Can't a man rest himself for a min--
                         
                          WARDEN
           What man? I can't stand to see
           people restin themselves. I'm
           eccentric. If you ain't got no work
           maybe I can scare you up some.
                         
          Mumbling, Leva rises and goes out. Warden goes over to Prew.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Whyn't you go on over to the Day

           comes through.
                         
          Prew looks up, nods, rises. He is half-way to the door when
          the phone at the Clerk's desk rings. Prew turns. Mazzioli
          stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it. Warden goes
          over, answers.
                         
                          WARDEN

          Warden puts down phone. He looks at the waiting men.

          Prew and a group of G Company men, including Sergeants Dhom,
          Thornhill and Henderson, are on the steps and porch as a
          Reconnaissance car pulls up and halts.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT RECONNAISSANCE CAR
          Maggio sits between the driver and another MP, both armed.
          (NOTE: These are not the same MPs with whom he fought.) The G
          Company men cluster around the car, ad-libbing greetings,
          kidding Maggio, bucking him up. Even the Sergeants join in
          this; nobody likes to see a man on his way to the Stockade.
                         
                          MAGGIO

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as the Driver gets out of the car and goes to pick up
          Maggio's stacked barracks bag on the porch. Prew moves up
          close to Maggio.
                         
                          PREW

           Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,
           neither can no lousy Stockade.
                         
                          SECOND MP
           You heard him say SHUT UP!
                         
                          MAGGIO

          During last speech the Driver returns, dumps the barracks bag
          in the car, and gets in. The motor starts. The men shout good-

          CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent
          in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on
          the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to
          the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a
          fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk
          sign reading: "SERGEANT OF THE GUARD." The man stands up and

          long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers
          of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs,
          fish... Pots of native stew... Bowls of exotic fruit... Peels
          of raw cane... Working over the food are the natives, many of

          Hawaiian costumes.

          A group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a
          group of old Hawaiian instruments. This is far removed from
          the night club Hula. This is a thing of swift, agile

          They shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch.
          It is Warden the dancers are teasing. Several of the dancers
          break out of the group, dance over to Warden, continue to
          prod him, apparently urging him to join them.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          protesting, joining in the laughter. Suddenly he kicks off
          his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. He snatches a
          gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him,
          sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances
          with the others. The music comes up louder and faster as the
          spectators and dancers roar.

          His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he

          and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on
          the stones in one of the trench-ovens. A cloud of steam
          rises, hiding them.

          answer.
                         
                          PREW
           We could have taken a cab. Except I
           ain't got cab fare.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The small house is perched precariously on the very edge of
          the cliff. Alma and Prew come around the bend, come up to the
          door, Prew marvelling at the house.
                         
                          ALMA
           This other girl and I were lucky to
           rent it.
                          (PROUDLY)
           It's a very fashionable district.
                         
          She hands Prew her key. As he is unlocking the door:
                         
                          ALMA
           I'll get an extra one made for you.
                         
          Prew swings open the door and they go in.

                         FULL SHOT
          Prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy
          amazement. It is large, smartly furnished. In the rear, glass
          doors lead to a porch. One of the panelled walls is filled
          with bookshelves, floor to ceiling. The bookshelves are
          filled with books. A hearty feminine voice calls "Hi!" from
          the kitchen, and as Prew and Alma come into the room,
          GORGETTE enters from the kitchen. She is a very tall, very
          gay, good-looking girl.
                         
                          ALMA
           This is Gorgette, my roommate.
           Gorgette, this is Prew. I told you
           about him.
           93.
                         
                         
                         
                          GORGETTE
           Don't mind me. I'm going out in a
           little while.
                         
          Prew grins, can't keep his eyes off the astonishing books.
          Gorgette follows his glance.
                         
                          GORGETTE
           I belong to the Book of the Month
           Club. I always take every book.
           That way I get all the dividends.
                         
          She giggles and goes off to the bedroom.
                         
                          PREW
           She'll be great for Maggio when he
           gets out of the Stockade. He'll be
           crazy about her because she's so
           tall.
                         
          Alma smiles, presses him into a chair.
                         
                          ALMA
           Now you just get comfortable and
           I'll make you a Martini and see
           what's to cook for dinner.
                         
          She starts oft to kitchen.
                         
                          PREW
           Hey.
                         
          She turns.
                         
                          PREW
           This is just like bein married,
           ain't it?

                         FULL SHOT
          SHOOTING through smoke rising from one of the trench-ovens.
          As it clears we see the enormous Hawaiian woman and one or
          two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the
          fires. The merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is
          over. In b.g., quite alone, are Warden and Karen, sitting on
           94.
                         
                         
          the trunk of a fallen palm tree.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND WARDEN
          The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. They survey
          the emptiness. The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes
          over one of the dying fires. She speaks to Warden in
          Hawaiian. He answers her in the native tongue. The fat woman
          stares, shrugs, goes off.
                         
                          KAREN
           What did she say?
                         
                          WARDEN
           She said it's over -- time to go
                          HOME --

           Home... A beach, a car, a park...
                         
          Warden puts his arm around her tenderly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It'll work out...
                         
                          KAREN
           It can't go on like this much

           I know.
                         
          He rises, paces a moment.
                         
                          WARDEN
           If there were only a way! Your
           lovin husband'd probly give you the
           divorce. But even if he didn't know
           what for, he'd never let me
           transfer.
                         
                          KAREN
           (bucking up courage;
                          QUIETLY)
           There is a way. I've been thinking
           about it.
                         
          Warden looks at her apprehensively.
                         
                          KAREN
           You've got to become an officer.

           You're eligible for the extension
           course that came in with the draft.
           When you get your commission they'd
           ship you back to the States -- new
           officers aren't kept at posts where
           they've been enlisted men. Then --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You sure made a thorough study of
           it.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then I could divorce Dana and
           follow you and marry you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           An officer! I've always hated
           officers.
                         
                          KAREN
           That's a fine, intelligent point
           of view. Suppose I said I've always
           hated Sergeants. That would make a
           lot of sense, wouldn't it?
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He sits, thinks it over unhappily.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay, suppose I did it. -- And
           don't think it's a cinch -- the
           exams are tough. Then you'd be
           getting your divorce here while I'm
           in the States. We'd be apart maybe
           six months! We'll probly be in the
           war by then --

           in less than a year.

           even in love with me --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You're crazy! I wish I wasn't in
           love with you. Maybe could enjoy
           life again.
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't know what's happened to you

                          WARDEN
           At first! You were tough and solid
           as a rock -- and now you're a
           whining crybaby --

                          KAREN
           And so they were married and lived
           unhappily ever after.
                         
          They are silent for several moments.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I've never been so miserable in my

          Warden rises and paces again. Suddenly he stops, turns, looks
          down at Karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'll probably make the lousiest
           officer they ever saw in this Army.
                         
          A happy smile creeps over Karen's face. Despite himself, he
          begins to smile also.

          The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the
          living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and
          Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is
          playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often?" A table still
          contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the
          wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step,
          stumbles.
                         
                          PREW

          working with his thoughts, afraid to broach them. He lights a

          looking through records for a new choice. She speaks quite

                          ALMA
           That's nice. Because I love you,
           too.

           I never thought a thirty-year man
           had any business to think of gettin
           married.
                         
          She stares at him, amazed, a touch angry.
                         
                          ALMA
           You're a funny one, little Prew
           boy.
                         
                          PREW
                          (HURT)
           Yeah. Must be the altitude.
                         
                          ALMA
           A very funny one that I cannot
           figure out.
                         
                          PREW
           Why's it funny if a guy wants to
           marry you?
                         
                          ALMA
           Because I'm a girl you met at the
           New Congress Club! And that's about
           two steps up from the pavement.
                         
                          PREW
           Okay -- I'm a private no class
           dogface soljer. And the way most
           civilians look at it, that's two
           steps up from no thin.
                         
          There is a silence. Alma is honestly distraught.
                         
                          ALMA
           Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were
           happy: Why do you want to spoil
           things?

                          PREW
           Lissen, I ain't think in of now.
           But I got a plan cookin in my head.
           You want to go back to the States
           in a year. Well, you could stretch
           it some, make it two years. And I
           could swing a Sergeant's stripes --
           If I were a non-com the Army'd let
           me pick my duty when I re-enlist.
           (lost in the picture of
                          IT)
           And there's some posts back in the
           States -- like Jefferson Barracks --
           The married noncoms rate solid
           brick houses... with lawns with new-
           cut grass and walks with big old
           oak trees...
                         
                          ALMA
           Now I know you've lost your mind!
           How do you expect to become a
           Sergeant under this Captain Holmes
           of yours? It's all you can do to
           keep out of the Stockade!

           It I go out for boxin he'd send me
           to non-com school. The Regimental
           Championship is next month. I bet I
           could win the middleweight even
           without training. I used to be
           pretty good I could do it.
                         
          Alma is deeply moved. She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at
          all immodestly.
                         
                          ALMA
           No. I don't think you should give
           in to The Treatment... even to
           marry me.
                         
                          PREW
           This'd be worth it.

                          (ALMOST DESPERATELY)
          Prew -- it's true we love each
          other now. But back in America, it
          might be different... We might not
          even want each other...
                         
                          PREW
          Okay. But that ain't the real
          reason.
                         
                          ALMA
          All right. It's not.
                         
                          PREW
          What's the real reason you won't
          marry me?
                         
                          ALMA
          I won't marry you because I don't
          want to be the wife of a soldier.
                         
                          PREW
          Well, that's the top I could ever
          do for you --
                         
                          ALMA
          Because nobody's going to stop
          me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.
          Because want to be proper.
                         
                          PREW
          Proper?
                         
                          ALMA
                          (IMPASSIONED)
          Yes, proper. Respectable. Secure.
          In a year I'll have enough money
          saved. I'm going back to my home
          town in Oregon and I'm going to
          build a new home for my mother and
          myself and join the country club
          and take up golf. And then I'll
          meet the proper, man with the
          proper position. And I'll be a
          proper wife who can keep a proper
          home and raise proper children. And
          I will be happy because when you
          are proper you are safe.

           You got guts, Alma. I hope you pull
           it off.
                         
          The victrola record ends. Alma turns away from Prew and goes
          to the victrola. Now that shots had her say with such
          certainty, she deflates. Except for the fact that she looks
          like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry.
          She lifts the record off the turntable.
                         
                          ALMA
           But I do mean it when I say I need
           you. Because I'm lonely. Sometimes
           I'm dreadfully lonely... You think
           I'm lying, don't you?
                         
                          PREW
           No. Nobody ever lies about being
           lonely...
                         
          Alma puts the same record on again. Prew looks out over the
          beautiful view.

           going to ignore it any longer! I

          MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES AND KAREN
          at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen. Holmes is a mixture
          of petulance, anger and frustration. He doesn't touch his
          food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee.
                         
                          KAREN
           I'm afraid I'm not going to tell

                          HOLMES
           One thing I know. I know it's a
           civilian. You'd be too discreet to
           pick an Army man.
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't think it's any of your
           business who he is.
                         
                          HOLMES
           It is my business! I'm your
           husband! What do you think a
           scandal would do to my chances for
           a promotion? So if you're thinking
           of a divorce, you can forget it!
                         
          Karen stiffens. She struggles to maintain her self-
          possession. She manages it, keeps outwardly calm through the
          scene.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Now -- how does it feel to know
           you'll have to live with a horror
           like me the rest of your life?
                         
                          KAREN
           Not very nice. But then there's the
           compensation of knowing you'll have
           to live with me the rest of your
           life.
                         
          Her attitude makes Holmes progressively sorrier for himself.
          CAMERA MOVES with him as during following he rises, goes to
          stove, pours himself another cup of coffee. He spills a
          little and the liquid sizzles on the burner.
                         
                          HOLMES

           a man all up -- inside.

          Prew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three
          other men, one of them Sal Anderson. Another is PRIVATE NAIR,
          a tousle-headed, sentimental man we have not seen before.
          Sergeant Thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the
          ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic
          book. Prew works his way over to Nair.

           It was rugged, sam. But I kept my
           mouth shut and watched my step and
           I wasn't in no trouble.
                         
                          PREW
           You see Maggio?
                         
          Nair nods, tells his tale in half-humorous, half-reverent
          fashion.
                         
                          NAIR
           Fatso's workin him over with a hoe
           handle. Places where it won't show
           mostly. You know, the back and the
           chest. The kidneys. Once in a while
           in the face. Know what Maggio does
           when that happens? Spits in Fatso's
           eye.
                          (CHUCKLES)
           Oh, he's a hot one. Ain't he a hot
           one?
           105.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           He's a good boy.
                         
                          NAIR
           Course, he throws up a little blood
           now and then. And he passes out a
           lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin
           none of that. So there's no way
           they goin to find out.
                         
                          PREW
           Why don't he go to the C.O.?
                         
                          NAIR
           We tried to get him to. But he
           won't peep. He says he got a lot
           more scalp to lose first. That boy
           is about the hardest artery in the
           hospital.
           (with great sentiment)
           But he's got a heart just like a
           great big baby.
                         
          Prew's face has been growing in fury. He pulls up a clump of
          sod, throws it down with all his might.
                         
                          PREW
           You think he's gonna be all right?
                         
                          NAIR
           Your guess is worth mine, sam.
           Maybe he's crackin a little at that
           -- cause after Fatso put him in the
           Hole -- that's what they call
           solitary -- a couple times he began
           talkin about how he's gonna e-
           scape. He said to tell you he'll
           look you up one of these nights.
                         
          A shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew.
                         
          SHOT GALOVITCH FROM PREW'S POV
          CAMERA SHOOTING UP from near the ground, the ANGLE
          EXAGGERATING Galavitch's ungainly, ape-like figure. He looks
          down at Prew, full of venom.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Still on knees, eh, Prewitt? Well,
           boxing finals next month. December
           f if teen. You s till got time help
           us make champions.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW FROM GALOVITCHE'S POV
           106.
                         
                         
          Prew is at the breaking point. Controlling himself, he weeds
          around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again.
                         
                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE
           Are proud dis Compny to be or not?
           Bites de hand dat feeds it der
           shoot dogs for. Infortunately, ony
           dogs day are allowed to shoot, not
           men.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT GROUP
          The other men have stopped weeding, are looking over at Prew
          and Galovitch. Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book
          and comes over to them during following.
                         
                          PREW
           Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna
           move around you again.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           You need better lesson than up to
           now. Maybe I give to you myself.
           Maybe right now.
                         
          He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy
          shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill
          steps between them.
                         
                          THORNHILL
                          (TO GALOVITCH)
           Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my
                          DETAIL --
                         
          Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He
          starts unbuttoning his shirt.
                         
                          PREW
                          (TO GALOVITCH)
           All right. It's gonna be your way.
                         
          Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as
          he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to
          change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize
          fighter.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- !
                         
          Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch
          charges him.
                         
          VARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS
          During following men run from across the quadrangle and from
          out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around
           107.
                         
                         
          the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around
          Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering
          but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times.
          Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never
          throws a punch at the other's head.
                         
                          NAIR
           The head, Prew! Hit him in the
           head!
                         
          The other men around shout similar advice.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT GALOVITCH
          puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts
          of the men. He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a
          trick.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as
          he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the
          memory of Dixie Wells.
                         
          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES
                         
                         CLOSEUP PREW
          flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the
          other's eyes.
                         
          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye.
          He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill
          breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR
                         
                          SPECTATOR
           I don't get it -- Why don't Prew go
           for the head?
                         
                          DHOM
           He blinded a guy once. Must be
           scairt of the same thing.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          as Galovitch batters Prew back against the crowd. A right to
          the temple sends him to his knees. He shakes his head a
          moment, gets up and goes into a clinch.

          LONG SHOT OUT WINDOW To FRONT OF BARRACKS
          SHOOTING OVER heads of men watching, out to Prew and
          Galovitch on the ground. Dispassionate, professional ad-libs
          from the men: why does Prew continue his attack to the body
          only, a good little man and a good big man, etc.

          SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES FEATURING WARDEN
          Warden is at his desk filling out an application blank.
          Holmes is glancing over his shoulder..
                         
          INSERT: OFFICER EXTENSION COURSE APPLICATION BLANK
          Warden's hand in shot filling out answers to sex, age, race,
          etc.
                         
                          HOLMES' VOICE
           I'll be glad to recommend you,
           Warden. You've got service,
           experience, grade. You'll make an
           excellent officer.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE:
                         
          Holmes waits for thanks.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (AFTER HESITATING)
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs. Thornhill runs
          into the office, breathless. He comes to a shaking attention
          as he sees Holmes.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease, Sergeant. What's the
           matter?
                         
                          THORNHILL
           They fightin on the green, sir!
           Galovitch and Prewitt.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ike looks like `e goin to murder
           him, sir.
                         
          A pleased look crosses Holmes' face. Warden jumps up, starts
          for door. Holmes catches his arm.
           109.
                         
                         
                         
                          HOLMES
           There's no rush. I'll take care of
           it.
                         
          Holmes goes out. Thornhill follows, turns at the door.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ain't you want to see it, First?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (SHOUTS SUDDENLY)
           No! I ain't want to see it! Nor you
           either! Get out of here!
                         
          Thornhill goes. The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs.
          Warden walks to his desk, stares down at the application
          form, picks it up. He carries it over to Holmes' desk. He
          looks at the picture of Karen on the desk.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PHOTOGRAPH OF KAREN
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He stares at the picture, then looks at the application
          blank. Then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm. He rubs
          his hand over the chevrons gently, fondly. He looks at the
          application blank again very thoughtfully.
                         
          EXT. BARRACKS - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH ON LAWN
          A continuation of the fight. Prew is tiring, his face is cut
          and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is
          unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his
          stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s
          tactics.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS
          FEATURING the non-"ath-a-leets" of G Company, including
          Anderson, Clark and Treadwell. Ad-libbed shouts of "In the
          face, Prew! In the face!"
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          FEATURING the "ath-a-loots," including Dhom, Wilson and
          Henderson. They are watching quietly, nodding with approval
          as Prew feints, then darts several punches into Galovitch's
          ribs, It almost seems as if they are admiring Prew's courage,
          inwardly rooting for him. Holmes enters the group, Thornhill
          tagging after him. Holmes stops and watches the fight. There
          is a look of satisfaction on his face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          The fight continuing.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          near rear of crowd. An officer, walking across the lawn, is
          attracted by the noise. He steps into the crowd. This is
          COLONEL WILLIAMS. He wears the insignia of the Inspector
          General's Department. He watches the fight, is about to step
          through to break it up when he sees Holmes. He stops, watches
          Holmes' reactions.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew, backed up against the crowd, trips over somebody's
          feet. He falls without being hit. Galovitch kicks at him and
          Prew rolls away. The crowd murmurs angrily. Sergeant Stark
          steps out into the open circle, faces Galovitch.
                         
                          STARK
           This ain't no rassle, Ike. You got
           to fight this man fair.
                         
          Approving shouts from the crowd. Stark steps back. Ike waits
          for Prew to get up.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          looking up at Galovitch.

                         CLOSEUP PREW
          His eyes narrow, harden as if his inner struggle has been
          resolved.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew gets to his feet. As Galovitch comes to him, Prew feints
          for the stomach, then throws a hard right to Galovitch's
          face. It hits him flush on the nose. Blood spurts. The crowd
          roars.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands. Prew
          drives both fists to his solar plexus. Galovitch drops his
          guard. Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple.
          Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          The whole nature of the fight has changed. Galovitch, hurt
          and reeling, rushes Prew, bull-like, head down, defense wide
          open. Prew dodges easily, slamming hard with rights and lefts
          to the head.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Holmes, seeing Prew is now clearly in command, steps out of
          the crowd and up to the two fighters.
           111.
                         
                         
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (SEVERELY)
           All right. Let's cut it.
                         
          There is a look of relief on the faces of both Galovitch and
          Prew as they stop fighting.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What started this?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
                          (PUFFING)
           Prewitt talk back to non-com.
           Refuse order I give him, start
           fight. I teach him lesson.
                         
          A laugh from the crowd.
                         
                          HOLMES
           You won't disobey any more orders
           in my Company, Prewitt. Warden
           saved you from a court martial once
           but he won't this time --
                         
          Anderson steps into the circle.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Sir -- I'm sorry, sir but Private
           Prewitt's not to blame for this.
           Sergeant Galovitch started it.
                         
          Holmes reacts, momentarily at a loss. He turns to Thornhill.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (MEANINGFULLY)
           Thornhill, you're in charge of this
           detail. How about it?
                         
          Thornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           `e's right, sir.
           (points to Galovitch)
           `e begun it. Prewitt done nothin.
                         
          From the crowd step Sergeants Dhom, Wilson and Henderson.
          They face Holmes and Galovitch implacably.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           No, sir, this wasn't Prewitt's
           fault.
           112.
                         
                         
                         
                          DHOM
           That's right, sir. Everybody knows
           Galovitch started it.
                         
          Wilson nods. There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd.
          Holmes looks at his fighters, rocked by this betrayal. They
          stare back at him.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT COLONEL WILLIAMS
          Still near the rear of the crowd, he watches the scene with
          much interest.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd.
                         
                          HOLMES
           That's all. Break it off. Let's get
           back to our jobs.
           (to Prew and Galovitch;
                          WEAKLY)
           I'm giving you two a break. I'll
           ignore this.
                         
          He walks off. He does not see Colonel Williams. Galovitch
          moves off toward the barracks. Wilson, Henderson and
          Thornhill remain grouped around Prew.
                         
                          PREW
           You guys figure this means I'm
           steppin into a ring, you're wrong.
                         
                          EMERSON
           It's your show, kid. Run it the way
           you want.
                         
                          WILSON
           You better put same iodine on them
           cuts.
                         
                          DHOM
           Yeah. An come over to Choy's
           tonight. We buy you a beer.
                         
          The non-coms walk off, Prew stares after them.

          LONG SHOT ACROSS ROAD PREW CLARK ANDERSON
          Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful
          twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson. CAMERA
          MOVES SLOWLY toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are
           113.
                         
                         
          low. The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles.
                         
           PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON
                          (SINGING SOFTLY)
           Woke up sick on Thursday
           Feelin like my head took a dare
           Looked down at my trousers
           All my pockets was bare
           That girl sure was bad news
           Re-enlistment Blues...
                         
          The guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as CAMERA HOLDS
          on MEDIUM SHOT. The men chuckle.
                         
                          CLARK
           Some day I'm goin back to Scranton
           and play it for my folks. And tell
           em it wan composed in the Hawaiian
           Islands! Clear across the Pacific
           Ocean!
                         
                          PREW
           (finishes long swig of
                          BEER)
           Hey, Friday.
                         
                          CLARK
           Yeah?
                         
                          PREW
           Why you called Friday?
                         
                          CLARK
           Don't know. I was borned on
           Wednesday.
           (plucks guitar, sings)
           Went back around on Friday
           Asked for a free glass of beer...
                         
          The three laugh, sing in unison.
                         
           PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON
           My friends had disappeared
           Barman said, `Take off, no credit
           here'...
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR ENTRANCE TO CHOY'S
          The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter
          and shouts from the beerhouse. Warden comes out, wobbles a
          bit. He has One On. He cups his hand over his ear, straining
          to hear the singing. He stumbles into Choate, coming along
          the sidewalk.
           114.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHOATE
           Top, you sure plastered.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (MUSTERING DIGNITY)
           I am off duty. Off duty if I want
           to get plastered --
                         
          But Choate has gone into Choy's. CAMERA RETREATS with Warden
          as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the
          singing. Half-way across the road he unceremoniously sits
          down, crosses his knees Buddha-wise. Here the singing is more
          audible. He listens contentedly.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW ANDERSON CLARK

           Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment
           Blues...
                         
          Anderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant
          display on the guitar. Prew stands up. In the glow of a
          streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with
          Galovitch. He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One
          On.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Where you go in?
                         
                          PREW
           Back to Choy's. Get nother drink.
                         
          The guitars and singing continues in b.g. through following.
          CAMERA PANS with Prew as he weaves to the road.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MIDDLE OF ROAD
          as Prew crosses. He can see the seated figure but the light
          from the street is too dim to identify it.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
                          (BOOMS)
           Halt!
                         
          Prew stops automatically.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Who goes there?
                         
                          PREW
           A friend.
           115.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Advance, friend, and be reconized.
                         
          Prew moves closer, CAMERA WITH him, until he recognizes
          Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (roaring, laughing)

           Whatever you doin out all by

                          PREW
           I'm goin to get a drink.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Siddown. I got a bottle.
                         
          He pulls a bottle of whisky from his field jacket, holds it
          up to Prew. Prew takes the bottle and drinks. Then he sits
          down in the road as matter-of-factly as did Warden. He gives
          the bottle back to Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I hand it to you, kid. They called
           off The Treatment this afternoon.
           When you beat up Ike. I never heard
           of no soljer before ever lickin The
           Treatment...
           (drinks; then holds out
                          BOTTLE)
           Here, old buddy. Have a lil drink.
                         
          Prew drinks.
                         
                          WARDEN
           This is a terrible crummy life, you

                          PREW
           Miserble. Perfeckly miserble.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What if a truck or somethin was to
           come along and run over us?
                         
                          PREW
           Awful. Awful. We'd be dead,
           wouldn't we?

           An nobody to even mourn. You better
           not sit here any more. You better
           get up and move over to the side of
           the road.
                         
                          PREW
           What about you? You got more to
           live for than me. You got to take
           care of your Compny.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm old. Don't matter if I die. But
           your life's ahead of you. You get
           up.
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir. Never deserted a friend in
           need. I'll stay to the bitter end.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (shakes head stubbornly)
           We'll stay together.
                         
          They square their shoulders heroically.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (as if to an invisible

           No blindfold. Save it to wipe your
           nose on, you skunk.
                         
                          PREW
           Amen.
                         
          Each takes a drink.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Prew, I got the biggest troubles in
           the whole world.
                         
                          PREW
           The whole world?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (NODS)
           Take love. Did you personally ever
           see any of this love?
                         
          Prew nods gravely.
           117.

           see, she wants me to become.
                         
                          PREW
           Become what?
                         
                          WARDEN
           (after long hesitation)
           An officer. Can you see me as an
           officer?
                         
                          PREW
           Sure I can see it. You'd make a
           good officer.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You both can see more'n I can. You
           know what, Prew? I'm scared become
           an officer.
                         
                          PREW
           You ain't scared of nothin, Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, I am. I tell myself diffrnt
           but it's a fack. Where'd I be
           as an officer? How could I handle
           him? That's the one thing I'm
           scared of... be an officer in the
           U.S. Army.
                          (HASTILY)
           Army of the U.S.
                         
                          PREW
           A man should be what he can do.
                         
          Warden nods solemnly as if Prew has uttered a great truth.
          They pass the bottle once more.
                         
                          WARDEN
           How's your girl? Wha'st that name
           again?
                         
                          PREW
                          (HESITATES)
           Lorene.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Oh, yeah, I remember. Lorene.
           Beautiful name.
           118.
                         
                         
                         
          Warden claps Prew on the shoulder as if he is a lifelong
          friend. They smile. They look as if they are sharing a great
          secret, a secret known to them alone in the world. The
          mournful guitars and singing comes over a little louder.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The headlights of a jeep descend upon Warden and Prew. Then
          the vehicle skids into the shot with a screeching of brakes,
          comes to a halt directly in front of the men. Warden and Prew
          look at the car calmly, don't move. The headlights are
          blazing on them. Stark hops out from the driver's seat,
          furious.
                         
                          STARK
           Whatsa matter with you, you crazy,
           dumb screwballs?! You tryin to get
           killed?!
                         
                          WARDEN
           What you doin with that jeep,
           Sergeant Stark?
                         
                          STARK
           I borrowed it. I'm goin to town.
           What you doin in the middle of the
           road?
                         
          The music of the guitars has stopped. There is a strange
          whine now, far in the distance, not identifiable. It grows
          during following.
                         
                          WARDEN
           My friend Prew and I sittin here
           discussin the weather.
                         
                          STARK
           Your friend, huh?
                         
                          PREW
           You beard me. I said my buddy
           Warden. My good friend Warden that
           you better not run over is what I
           said.

                          WARDEN
                          (ASSUMING ANGER)
           Don't you know you got to look out
           for this man. Get him off the road
           before you run him over. He's the
           best stinkin soljer in the Compny.
           119.
                         
                         
                         
                          STARK
           You both must be plumb nuts.
                         
                          PREW
           You heard me. Get this man to some
           safety. Why, he's the best stinkin
           soljer in the Compny.
                         
                          STARK
           I guess I'm the one who's nuts.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT MAGGIO
          as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the
          blaze of the headlights. There are scars, new and healing on
          Maggio's face. One of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to
          give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy. A couple of
          teeth are missing. Weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a
          nightmare figure, an apparition. The whine in the distance is
          identifiable now. It is the siren of the Stockade.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           ... figgered you might be at

                         GROUP SHOT
          The men gape at Maggio, unable to accept the shock of his
          appearance. Then Prew and Warden jump up and catch him as he
          is about to fall. The drunkenness drains out of them. Stark
          watches in bewilderment.
                         
                          MAGGIO

          Warden steps back as Prew holds Maggio. During following
          Anderson and Clark come over, watch pop-eyed.

           Come on, let's get him to the
           hospital.
                         
          Maggio grasps him tighter. He is crying now.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Prew... they gonna send you to the

          He goes limp in Prew's arms, slides to the road.
                         
                         GROUP SHOT
          Warden bends over Maggio. The others watch, scared.

                          CLARK
           Dead? But he was here just a minute
           ago.
                         
          Prew bends over, picks up Maggio, holds him in his arms
          gently, unbelieving.
                         
                          STARK
           Fatso's lucky. They'll figure he
           got killed fallin out of that

                          PREW
           He ain't dead.
                         
          CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of Prew as he carries Maggio to the jeep,
          the others following. He lifts Maggio into the rear of,the
          jeep. Warden puts his hand on Prew's arm.
                         
                          WARDEN
           He's dead, Prew.
                         
          Prew stares at Maggio, lying in the jeep. Stark gets into the
          front of the jeep.
                         
                          STARK
           I'll take him, Prew.
                         
          He starts the motor. Prew leans over, moves Maggio's body a
          little.

                         LONG SHOT
          Framed beautifully in the moonlight, the Quadrangle and
          Barracks area look like a college campus. Silence. No
          movement.
                         
          LONG SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE
          A figure can be seen far in b.g, at the Bugler's post beside
          the megaphone. Another figure stands near him. The silence
          continues, then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning
           122.
                         
                         
          Taps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and
          certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The
          second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the
          first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into
          the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen
          attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette. The Taps
          continues through the following.

                         FULL SHOT
          Most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the
          bugle. Some prop up on their elbows.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT CHOATE
          as he listens. A look of mingled longing and satisfaction.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT LEVA
          listening. A strange look of pride.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT MAZZIOLI
          listening, his face also betraying emotions normally
          concealed.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT TREADWELL AND ANDERSON
          listening. Their bunks are next to each other.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail,
          listening. Their faces are thoughtful, sad.
                         
          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
          The office lit only by a light over his desk. He is working
          late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him. He listens to
          the bugle call, moved, sorrowful. He snaps off the light,
          listens in the darkness.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          at the Bugler's post. He is finishing the last phrases, full
          and wonderful. Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless.
          The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone
          for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes
          reverberating across the silent quadrangle.
           123.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN
          lying on his back in his bunk, arms clasped behind his head.
          He listens, his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier.
          He breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and
          epitaph.

          More men are propped on their elbows, their heads turned
          toward the Bugler. The dim figure of Treadwell can be seen,
          at a window now.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           (almost inaudible whisper)
           ... I told you it was Prewitt...
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          continuing the Taps. There are tears in his eyes now.
                         
          EXT. BARRACKS STEPS - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          A half dozen men are sitting on the steps, listening, among
          them Stark and Wilson. Stark shakes his head sadly.

                         LONG SHOT
          Several groups of two and three scattered about. They are
          standing in no particular places, as if they have been
          walking and stopped suddenly. They are all looking toward the
          Bugler.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ANDERSON
          as the Taps repeat is drawing to a close. He is lying on his
          side, turned toward the Bugler, a look of serenity, of peace
          on his face. His eyes close as he falls asleep.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          coming to the end of the Taps. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSEUP.
          Prew's face is wet with tears. His lips are pinched and red.
          He blows the final notes.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW AND CLARK
          Prew lowers the bugle slowly and lets the megaphone rest in
          its swivel. He withdraws the mouthpiece, puts it in his
          pocket. He hands the bugle to Clark. Clark looks at the
          instrument as if it has become hallowed. Prew walks off into
          the darkness.

                         TRACKING SHOT
          CAMERA MOVES along street, passing a lone pedestrian. It
          MOVES TOWARD the sign NEW CONGRESS CLUB, HOLDS beside an open
          window through which is heard the sound of harsh piano
          playing; the pounding style and lack of shading are clearly
          Fatso Judson's. CAMERA PANS AND INCLUDES Prew, leaning
          against the building. He is watching the entrance to the Club
          patiently. There is relentless hatred on his face. The music
          stops. Prew does not move.

          MEDIUM SHOT AT ENTRANCE
          Hearty male laughter from within. The door opens and Fatso
          and a couple of sailors cane out. They are about to start
          down the street.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE
           Hello, Fatso.
                         
          Fatso looks around in direction of voice. CAMERA PANS,
          DISCLOSES Prew, still leaning against the building. Fatso
          squints, not recognizing him.
           125.

           You want me?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah, Fatso.
                         
          Fatso takes a couple of steps toward Prew, squints again.
                         
                          FATSO
           I don't like that nickname. You
           want to see me about somethin?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah. Let's step around the corner
           here where we can talk.
                         
          Prew's voice is so toneless as to be ominous.
                         
                          FATSO
                          (GRINS)
           Okay. Good night, gents.
                         
          The sailors go off. Fatso walks into the darkness of an alley
          next to the building. Prew follows.
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND FATSO
          Just enough light from the street lamp to illuminate about
          ten feet into the alley.
                         
                          FATSO
           Okay. You sore about somethin?
                         
                          PREW
           No. I just don't like the way you
           play the piano.
                         
          Fatso throws back his head and laughs loudly.
                         
                          PREW
           You know Maggio?
                         
                          FATSO
           The little Wop? The one who bust
           out of the Stockade? Sure. He was a
           real tough monkey. But crazy, see?
                         
                          PREW
           You killed him.
                         
                          FATSO
           Did I? If I did, he ask for it.
           126.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           I hear they're gonna court martial
           you, Fatso. But before the Army
           gets you, I want a piece of you
           myself.
                         
          There is the snick of a blade snapping open as Fatso pulls a
          knife. He moves toward Prew, who steps swiftly to one side.
                         
                          PREW
           I kinds thought you'd try that.
                         
          There is the same sound as Prew pulls a knife from his
          pocket, snaps it open, holds it out flat in his hand, showing
          it to Fatso.
                         
                          PREW
           This here's the one you pulled on
           Maggio once. Reconize it?
                         
          Fatso darts at Prew, knife raised. Prew moves back, but Fatso
          is on him and they both roll to one side along the building.
          The movement throws them deep into the shadows.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS
          The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional
          silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go
          deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a
          startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his
          knees and starts to crawl toward camera.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND
          as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the
          anguished face of Fatso. It slowly turns, is upside down in
          the frame.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes
          already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left
          side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares
          down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice.
                         
                          FATSO
           You've killed me. Why'd you want to
           kill me?
                         
          Prew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley
          away from camera.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road.
          His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers
          blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his
          handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife
          wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly.
                         
                          PREW
           (mumbles to himself)
           Gonna have an awful bad scar
           there...
                         
          He lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. The flame from
          the match illuminates his left wrist. There is a deep scar on
          it. It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his
          fingers across it.
                         
                          PREW
           ... scars...
                         
          He turns, moves on up the road; CAMERA MOVES CLOSE behind
          him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound
          track.

          the cliff. He is in much pain now. His hand rubs across his
          face; his fingers linger on his forehead near his eye.
                         
           PREW'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Gorgette is reading. CAMERA SHOOTS across them to the front
          door. The doorknob moves slowly, the door opens. Prew falls
          into the room and pitches to the floor.

          MEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES
          The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag
          are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office.
          Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report.
                         
                          COLONEL WILLIAMS
           --- In addition to inefficiency
           in administering his command and
           neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has
           been guilty of indefensible cruelty
           to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.
           This extended to instigating and
           encouraging wholly unauthorized and
           discreditable tactics to force the
           soldier to join the inter-regiment
           boxing team. These findings are the
           result of personal investigation by
           the Inspector General and are
           corroborated by numerous members of
           G Company.
                         
          Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk.
          Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he
          has really expected something like this for a long time. He
          makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through.

           I haven't any, sir... The charges --
           are true.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
           Holmes, the first thing I ever
           learned in the Army was that an
           officer takes care of his men. It
           seems to be the first thing you
           forgot. It's monstrous to think of
           anybody like you in command of
           troops. And believe me, you won't
           be for long. My only regret is that
           we have to keep you in uniform
           until a court martial is concluded.

           GENERAL SLATER(cont'd)
           In the meantime, of course, I'm
           relieving you of your present
           duties.
                         
          He indicates the meeting is over. Holmes rises, is about to
          leave, pauses.
                         
                          HOLMES
           If there were any way to avoid a
           court martial, sir. Any way...
                         
          The General frowns, is unresponsive. Holmes looks to Colonel
          Williams helplessly.
                         
                          COLONEL WILLIAMS
           There is one alternative,
           General... if you're so disposed. A
           resignation for the good of the
           service under AR 600-275.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
           (thinks a moment)
           I'll give you a chance you don't
           deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of
           resignation and have it on my desk
           this afternoon. I'll consider
           accepting it. Only because as far
           as I'm concerned, the quicker
           you're out of the Army the better
           for everybody. Especially the Army.

          He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is
          strangled, almost hysterical.
                         
                          HOLMES
           --- that's right, it's a letter of
           resignations I'm through! I've
           already been relieved! So you can
           begin packing. We're sailing for

          She shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the
          letter out of his hand, starts to read it. She stops after a
          sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on
          the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his
          head, emotionally bewildered. For perhaps the first time in
          his life he is nakedly honest.

           known all along how the men felt
           about me. They despised me...

          FEATURING placard reading LIEUTENANT ROSS. We hear Ross'
          first few words over this, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM
          SHOT. Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of
          toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the
          photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the
          wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill,
          Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross
          is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost
          unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their
          expressions. Warden, beside his desk, shares this.

          The men troop out, passing camera. As last man leaves, CAMERA
          IS ON Warden. He is looking at Ross with considerable
          approval, even admiration. He resumes a more normal
          expression as Ross turns toward him.

           `... still no clue in the fatal
           stabbing of Staff Sergeant James R.

          Prew, who has stopped singing but not turned his head,
          resumes the song.

           or not?
                         
          Prew nods blankly. He rises slowly and walks across the room
          toward Alma. But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a
          table beside her. He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his
          face contorted. He picks up the bottle, pours himself a
          drink.

          He smiles faintly, holds the glass high.

          Prew looks at her, hurt. He moves back to his table,
          mumbling.

          Prew sits at the table again, continues to mumble.

          Prew shakes his head sadly as if he doesn't know the answer.
          He picks up the paper he has been writing on, sings softly,
          testing the last couple of lines affectionately.

                         FULL SHOT
          CAMERA FEATURES clock on wall reading 7:52. About half the
          Company is at breakfast. There is considerable laughter and
          horseplay. Near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his
          plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned,
          earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on
          the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop
          eating, look at each other.
                         
                          ANDERSON

           Sunday mornin before eight o'clock.
                         
          The men resume eating. Warden moves a couple of steps toward
          the chow line when the second blast hits. It is much heavier
          and fuller.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his
          plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However,
          he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The
          plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second
          before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room.
                         
          EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY
                         
          FULL SHOT NEAR MESS HALL
          A man sprints toward the mess hall, yelling to right and left
          at the top of his lungs. As he approaches camera we see it is
          Mazzioli.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field!
           It's the Japs! They're bombing
           Wheeler Field! The Japs! It's the
           Japs! I saw the red circles on the
           wings!
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING UP CIRCLES ON UNDERSIDE OF MOVING PLANE
          The roar of the plane over shot.
                         
          MOVING SHOT SHOOTING DOWN FROM JAP PLANE PAST PILOT
          The figure of Mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane
           139.
                         
                         
          dives toward him, machine guns spitting.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAZZIOLI
          as the Jap plane flashes by close above him. The stones in
          the pavement pop up. Mazzioli flops on the street. The plane
          zooms.
                         
          FULL SHOT MESS HALL
          as the men rush out. In the front ranks are Warden, Karelsen,
          Stark and Choate, Choate carries his half-filled plate in one
          hand, a mug of coffee in the other. The men stretch their
          necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the
          street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black
          mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA
          MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him
          to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's
          knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a
          handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Some of the men continue to crane at the sky. A few pick up
          metal links from the Jap bullets.
                         
                          NAIR
           Say! This'll make me a good
           souvenir! A bullet from a Jap
           plane!
                         
                          WARDEN
           This ain't jawbone! This is for
           record. Theme real bullets that guy
           was usin. Get inside -- all of ya!
                         
          Warden gets Mazzioli to his feet, turns to first man in group
          surrounding them. It is Anderson.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Help him over to the hospital.
                         
          Anderson starts Mazzioli down the street.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING UP TO SKY
          A pair of planes are diving toward the street.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           GET INSIDE!
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The men rush for cover, all except Choate who is left alone
          in shot. He takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs, hastily
          downs a swig of coffee. Then he throws the plate and cup into
          the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise
          of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead.
           140.
                         
                         
                         
          INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          The men are pouring in from the Company street, all shouting
          at once. Warden pushes his way through them and jumps up on
          the pool table. His big voice booms.
                         
                          WARDEN
           All right, all right, you men!
           Quiet down! Quiet down! It's only a
           war. Ain't you ever been in a war
           before?
                         
          The men begin to quiet down, look to Warden respectfully.
          Through the scene the heavy earth shudders are felt and heard
          as bombs hit in the far distance. Also the sound of the
          strafing planes.
                         
                          WARDEN
           We're gonna organize a fire
           umbrella defense. I want the non-
           coms to get BARs and ammunition
           from the Supply Room and get up on
           the roof. Henderson, you're in
           charge of the loading detail. Get
           movin!
                         
          The non-coms push out the door.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           Hey, what about me? I been waitin
           all my life to git to shoot a BAR

                          WARDEN
           Okay. It's your life.
                         
          Treadwell hurries after the non-coms.
                         
                          WARDEN
           The rest of you guys - the CQ will
           unlock the rifle racks. Every man
           get his rifle and go to his bunk
           and stay there. And I mean stay
           there! I'm making each squad leader
           responsible to keep his men inside.
           If you have to use a rifle butt to
           do it, that's okay, too.
                         
          There are shouts of protest. The men are over the first shock
          now and beginning to get angry, anxious for action.
           141.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           You heard me! This ain't no
           maneuvers. You go runnin around
           outside you'll get your ears shot
           off. You want to be heroes, you'll
           get plenty chances later. You'll
           probly have Japs in your laps
           before night.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           What if they bomb us?
                         
                          WARDEN
           You hear a bomb comin, you're free
           to take off for the brush. But
           don't worry -- the Japs'll probly
           drop all their bombs on Pearl
           Harbor and Hickam. They ain't gonna
           waste `em on us. So let's can the
           chatter. We're wastin time. Squad
           leaders, get `em upstairs!
                         
          Squad leaders begin to herd their men out. Warden jumps off
          the pool table. Stark and Karelsen come up to him.
                         
                          STARK
           What you want me to do, First? I
           got a hangover, but I can still --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You stick in the kitchen and make a
           big pot of coffee. No -- make a
           barrel of coffee.
                         
                          KARELSEN
           I think I could get one of them
           Japs with a machine gun, Milt.
           We'll put the tripod over a
           chimney. And hold her down by the
           legs.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Whatever you say, Pete.
                         
          They smile at each other affectionately, then push into the
          crowd leaving the Day Room.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The non-coma are arguing violently with Leva at the door to
          the Supply Room. Jap planes are loud overhead.
           142.
                         
                         
                         
                          LEVA
           I don't care. I can't issue any
           live ammunition without a signed
           order from an officer.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           But there ain't no officers yet,
           you jerk! Lieutenant Ross lives off
           the post.
                         
                          LEVA
                          (FOLDS ARMS)
           I'm sorry fellows. Lieutenant Ross
           give me them orders himself. No
           signed order, no ammo. And that's
           all they are to it.
                         
          Warden hurries up to the group.

           He won't let us have no ammo, Top!
                         
                          CHOATE
           Hats got it locked up. An the keys
           in his pocket.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Gimme them keys!
                         
                          LEVA
           I can't, Top. I got to obey my
           orders. No live ammo without a
                          SIGNED --
                         
          They flatten against the wall as a Jap plane roars building-
          high down the street, machine guns flaring. After it passes,
          they rush back to Lava,
                         
                          WARDEN
           What's the matter? You blind? You
           see them planes --?!
                         
          Lava puts his hand in his pocket protectively, shakes his
          head.
                         
                          LEVA
           I ain't gonna do it, Top. I --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay. Chief, bust the door down.
                          (TO LEVA)
           Get the hell out of the way!
           143.
                         
                         
                         
          Choate, Henderson and Dhom back up for a run at the door.
          Leva moves in front of the door.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Go ahead. Bust it down. He'll get
           out of the way.
                         
                          LEVA
           Remember I warned you. I did my
           best.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay. I'll see you get a medal.
                         
          Warden dashes up the porch steps as Choate, Henderson and
          Dhom launch themselves at the door. Leva steps aside. The
          door rattles ponderously, then flies open. The three
          battering rams careen into the Supply Room. The men standing
          by cheer and rush in after them. Leva shakes his head grimly.
                         
          INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          The men are sitting on their bunks, unhappily, holding their
          rifles. Others who have slept through breakfast are dressing
          hastily. Warden rushes into the room. The men immediately
          bark ad-libbed questions at him:
                         
                          SOLDIERS
                          (AD LIB)
           What's the deal, First?
           Why can't we go up on the roof?
           Where's the ammo, Top?
           Are we soljers -- or Boy Scouts?
                         
                          WARN
                          (PITILESSLY)
           Start rollin full field packs! We
           may have to move out of here. Squad
           leaders, get `em packin!
                         
          In b.g. Henderson and others are going up the porch stairs to
          the roof. They tote BARs and loading clips. Karelsen and two
          helpers follow with a heavy machine gun and belt boxes.
          Warden starts for the porch stairs. He is attracted by
          something, stops, looks out of scene.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL FROM WARDEN'S POV
          lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it.
          He is in his underwear and a helmet, hugs his rifle.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL AND WARDEN
           144.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           You'll catch a cold, Turp.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Don't go out there, First Sergeant!
           You'll be killed! They're shootin
           it up! You'll be dead! You'll not
           be alive any more. Don't go out
           there!
                         
                          WARDEN
           You better put your pants on.
                         
          Warden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it
          sounds as if it's coming right into the room. A dotted line
          of bullets crosses the floor and moves into Warden's and
          Karelsen's room. Warden jumps up and rushes into the room.
                         
          INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor.
          Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's
          footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is
          polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc.,
          digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky;
          it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the
          bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.
                         
          EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
                         
          FULL SHOT ROOF
          About twenty of Company GIs men, including almost all the non-
          cams, are on the roof, They are crouched behind the chimneys
          or down on their knees in the corners. The BARs are propped
          on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to
          the sky.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO SKY
          Three Jap planes, forming a V, are heading straight for
          camera.
                         
          FULL SHOT MEN ON ROOF
                         
                          DHOM
                          (SHOUTING)
           Come on, you dirty sons --
                         
          The scream of the planes drowns Dhom's voice. There is a
          tremendous clatter as the men fire. The Jap planes pass,
          untouched.
           145.
                         
                         
          From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there
          is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine
          gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And
          Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly
          and lustily.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He
          shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild
          cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their
          first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about
          and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT FLASH JAP PILOT IN LEAD PLANE
          grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring. His silk scarf
          ripples out behind him.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          firing the BAR, standing, as the Jap planes roar over. He
          staggers back from the recoil.
                         
          FULL SHOT ROOF
          The men fire in unison. They rise after the planes pass,
          shake their fists. Henderson and others of the loading detail
          appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN
          He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. "These are my
          boys. This is my Company," it seems to say. The men answer
          back with a great answering shout.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting,
          slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. They
          respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a
          time. We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling.
                         
                          WARDEN
           -- Don't worry about wasting ammo!
           Throw your empty clips down into
           the yard. The loading detail will
           pick 'em up --
                         
          The sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard,
          blending into the rest of the noise. Treadwell runs to the
          edge of the roof, looks over.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO QUADRANGLE
          At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ON ROOF
          Treadwell turns, yells at the men.

                          TREADWELL
           Friday's gone crazy! He's blowing
           the Cavalry Charge!

          His cheeks puffed, blowing the bugle madly.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          He is lying on a couch in pajamas. He has not shaven, his
          hair is unkempt. A Radio Announcer is heard over shot. Prew
          wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with
          the blanket over him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT,
          DISCLOSING Alma and Gorgette. They have negligees over their
          nightgowns, are listening to the radio. The Announcer's voice
          tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the
          tremor out of it. (NOTE: Transcripts of the actual broadcast
          have been requested.)
                         
           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           ... This is a real attack, not a
           maneuver. The Japanese are bombing
           Pearl Harbor. Please keep in your
           homes. Do not go on the streets. I
           repeat, this is a real attack.
           Japanese planes are bombing our
           naval and army installations.
           Civilians will remain in their
           homes. This is a real attack -
                         
          The Announcer's voice goes on as above.
                         
                          PREW
                          (MUTTERS)
           Oh, those dirty Germans... Those
           dirty sneakin Germans...
                         
                          ALMA
           What Germans?!

           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           ... Attacks are now taking place at

           Schofield...
                         
                          PREW
           ... dirty Germans...
                         
          Alma shakes Prew, hard. He falls back on the couch, passes
          out.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          The Jap strafing attack is continuing. Their planes are
          making a figure 8 in the sky. Silhouettes of men on the roof
          can b e seen. Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge. In
          b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around.
          Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the
          quadrangle toward the barracks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS
          Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten
          men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into
          the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same
          carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up
          empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling
          them toward the Supply Room.
                         
          EXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING LEVA
          He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the
          loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole
          thing is still very unofficial.
                         
          EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The
          men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from
          excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the
          full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross
          clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR
          and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer.
                         
          TWO SHOT LIEUTENANT ROSS AND WARDEN
          Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps
          Warden on the shoulder.
                         
                          DHOM'S VOICE
           HERE THEY COME, MEN!
           148.
                         
                         
                         
          Sound of Jap planes comes up ear-splitting loud. Ross drops
          down behind a chimney, swings his BAR, fires. CAMERA MOVES TO
          INCLUDE Karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the
          machine gun. Two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the
          tripod. Two Jap planes pass in b.g. of shot, zoom off into
          the sky.
                         
                          KARELSEN
                          (DISGUSTEDLY)
           Nuts! Led him too tar.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as the men on the roof reload. In the distance the Jap planes
          have turned and are heading back for the roof.

          CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN
          firing the machine gun. He yanks the tripod away from his
          helpers, picks up the gun, stands and swings it after the
          plane. The recoil staggers him half way across the roof and
          deposits him on his rear.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT JAP PILOT
          He jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove, throws
          up his arms helplessly.
                         
          LONG SHOT OPEN FIELD SHOOTING FROM ROOF
          The Jap plane bursts into flame and crashes.
                         
          FULL SHOT ON ROOF
          The men rise as one with an uproarious cheer. They rush to
          Karelsen, pick him up. Warden lets go with another of his
          rebel yells.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You got him, Pete! You got him!

           Ah, nobody'll ever know which of us
           got that guy.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as the men return to their positions. Two planes head for
          them, pass over as Company G lets go again with everything it
          has.

           That was an American plane!
                         
                          WARDEN
           Well, he ain't got no business

           HERE COMES A JAP!
                         
          SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE
          swooping across the quadrangle about ten feet from the
          ground.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BUGLER'S POST
          Friday Clark, blowing the Cavalry Charge madly, abandons the
          megaphone as he sees the plane coming. He drops on his chest,
          hugging the bugle. The plane passes. Clark jumps up
          instantly, resumes blowing the Charge.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE
          The same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet
          above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The men flatten, all but Warden. He stands, swings his BAR
          toward the plane. CAMERA IS ANGLED so that Warden is
          silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the Jap plane.
                         
          LONG SHOT JAP PLANE
          It misses the roof by a foot or two, zooms up at a weird
          angle. A thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine. The
          plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end
          of the quadrangle.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT JAP PLANE
          crashing. The gas-tank explodes. A cloud of fire and black
           150.
                         
                         
          smoke obscures the screen.

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the
          glass doors. The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer
          (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of
          Pearl Harbor. Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks
          as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. He listens to the
          radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. He shakes his
          head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes
          his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he
          remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then
          as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he
          wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly
          lit room.
                         
                          PREW
           Alma! Alma!
                         
          He goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. Then he turns
          back to listen to the radio. Abruptly, he runs into the
          bedroom.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE
           Alma!
                         
          The room remains empty for a few moments as the radio
          announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks.
                         
           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           -- ready to fight and die for us,
           our Regular Army and Navy have this
           day upheld the faith and confidence
           we have always placed in them. They
           have proved their right to the
           esteem we have always had for
           them...
                         
          Prew comes back into the room. He has his shoes on, holds
          civilian shirt and pants in his hand. He starts to put them
          on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast.
          The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter. They are
          surprised to see Prew up. He nods at them, turns back quickly
          to listen to the radio as he continues dressing.

           (incoherent with rage; to
                          GIRLS)
           They're pickin trouble with the
           best Army in -- the best riflemen --
           you know we the ony country on the
           face of the earth that uses the
           shooting gunsling, not the carrying
           gunsling. You know that?
                         
          The radio continues on under the scene. Alma and Gorgette
          speak breathlessly, in a rush.
                         
                          ALMA
           We've been at Queens Hospital --
           giving blood --
                         
                          GORGETTE
           The town's a madhouse. Trucks,

                          ALMA
           A house on Kuhio Street was bombed

                          GORGETTE
           And the drugstore on McKully and
           King is smashed flat. And
           the man and his wife were killed --
                         
          Prew gestures to radio as if he's heard all about it. He
          sticks his shirttails into his trousers.
                         
                          PREW

           The Post? Tonight?
                         
          Prew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table.
                         
                          ALMA
           But why?

                          PREW
           Why? There's a war goin on.
                         
                          ALMA
           But you can't! You're not fit yet --
           you're weak as a kitten -- you're
           AWOL -- they'll throw you in the

                          (LAUGHS WILDLY)
           They'll be throwin `em out of the
           Stockade. They need every man they
           can get.
                         
          He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues"
          written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is
          reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if
          pleading for aid,
                         
                          GORGETTE
           Your side'll open up --
                         
                          ALMA
           And they'll find out it was you who
           killed that soldier!
                         
          Prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought.
                         
                          PREW
           Once I report in to the Compny I'll
           be all right. Once I get there. I
           gotta get back --
                         
                          ALMA
           But you'll never make it! There's
           MPs all over --
                         
                          PREW
           I'll make it. I'll go along the
           back roads. They'll let me in the
           West gate -- they'll know I'm a
                          SOLJER --
                         
          He puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts
          for the door.
                         
                          ALMA
           Stay till morning!
                         
          Prew glances at Alma incredulously. She sobs suddenly,
          violently.
           153.
                         
                         
                         
                          ALMA
           Maybe if you stayed till morning
           you'd change your mind...
                         
          She throws her arms around him, clings to him.
                         
                          ALMA
           Don't go, Prew! I'll do whatever
           you want... We'll figure out a way
           to get to the States
           together... We can even get
           married... If you go I won't see
           you any more... I know it...
                         
          Prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from
          him. He turns toward the door.

           What do you want to go back to the
           Army for?! What did the Army ever
           do for you? Besides treat you like
           scum and give you one awful going
           over and get your friend killed?
           What do you want to go back to that
           for?
                         
          Prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly.
                         
                          PREW

          MOVING SHOT JEEP WITH THREE MPs
          The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the
           154.
                         
                         
          dimmed headlights of the jeep. CAMERA SHOOTS PAST driver onto
          the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. The two other MPs
          clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside.
                         
                          FIRST MP
           They say they seen parachutists

          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY
          The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out
          of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing,
          are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He
          is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear
          his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized.
                         
           PREW'S VOICE (O.S.)
           ... almost home... ony across the
           golf course... now... now... no...
           wait... gotta be care?... gotta
           sweat it out...
                         
          He groans, puts his hand to his side. In the feeble light
          from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. He looks up
          and down the road.
                         
           PREW'S VOICE (O.S.)
           ... it's clear now... gotta get
           home...
                         
          Still crouched, Prew starts across the road.
                         
          LONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD
          We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is
          visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the
          camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed
          headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we
          see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the
          opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is
          also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.

          Prew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight
          flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew
          slips to one knee.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has
          the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a
          senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and
          spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.
                         
                          MP'S VOICE
           HALT!
                         
          Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is
          a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs
          across the road and onto the golf course.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT JEEP
          The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place
          and starts across the golf course.
                         
          MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP
          Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the
          spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He
          heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he
          reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back
          at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.
                         
                          PREW
           -- I'm a soljer! --
                         
                          MP

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on
          him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of
          gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the
          trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot,
          crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring
          down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          CAMERA SHOOTS DOWN to Prew from top of trap. A portion of the
          jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs.

           Shut up.
                         
          The voices are lost as CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN toward Prew's
          open eyes. We hear his thoughts on the sound track, clear and
          fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the CAMERA
          REACHES A FULL HEAD CLOSEUP.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE

          CAMERA MOVES CLOSER TO CLOSEUP of Prew's open eyes.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE

          There is no sound as the screen remains black for several

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
                         
          TWO SHOT WARDEN AND A LIEUTENANT COLONEL
          They are looking down to camera, which SHOOTS UP as if from
          point of view of Prew's body in the sand trap. The dimmed
          headlights of two jeeps illuminates them. Warden is fighting
          to control his emotion, to remain the professional soldier.
          The Lieutenant Colonel is disturbed, but kindly.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Where's your Company Commander?
                         
                          WARDEN
           He's at Headquarters, sir. I'm the
           First Sergeant.
           157.
                         
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Did you know this man personally?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
          They are standing on the lip of the sandtrap. The hoods of
          the jeeps that chased Prew and the second jeep are just
          behind them in shot.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           He didn't have any regular
           identification. But they found a
           card on him with his name --
           (holds card close to
                          HEADLIGHT)
           -- seems to be a membership in a
           club. The -- New Congress Club.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel hands the card to Warden.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I'll turn this over to you. And
           these other things that were on
           him. This --
                         
          He unfolds a sheet of paper, holds it to the headlight. He
          and Warden squint at it.
                         
          INSERT: CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER WITH PENCILED WRITING:
          "Re-enlistment Blues" is written at the top. The stanzas of
          the song are beneath the heading.
                         
           LIEUTENANT COLONEL'S VOICE
           Seems to be acme sort of poem.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Yes, air.
                         
          Very softly, so distant that we can only distinguish a word
          or two now and then, we hear the voices of Clark, Anderson
          and Prew singing the "Re-enlistment Blues." The plaintive
          melody continues under the rest of the scene.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           And this. Whatever it is.
           158.
                         
                         
                         
          He holds Prew' s bugle mouthpiece up to the light, gives it
          to Warden. Warden holds it in his hand, stares at it. Under
          the "Re-enlistment Blues," even softer, farther away, we now
          hear Prew's bugle blowing Taps. It continues, with the song,
          to the end of the scene.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It's the mouthpiece of a bugle.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel looks at Warden closely.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Are you all right, Sergeant? Was
           this man a friend of yours?
                         
          Warden speaks very formally.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Sir, this man was a good soldier.
           He loved the Army moren any soljer
           I ever knew. I would like to make a
           formal request that this body be
           buried in the Army's permanent
           cemetery at Schofield Barracks.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I believe I can attend to that for
           you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Thank you, sir.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I'm sorry, Sergeant.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel walks off.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE WARDEN
          INCLUDING Prew's body in the shot as Warden looks down at it.
          He looks at it for several moments. The Taps is just coming
          to an end. Warden speaks very quietly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, sir. I hardly knew the guy...

          Taps and the Re-enlistment Blues are swept away by the lush

          She turns and CAMERA PANS to INCLUDE Alma in shot, standing
          beside Karen. She is dressed in black, quite severely.

           No one would know there was a war,
           from out here.
                         
          Karen takes off her leis, begins tossing them over the rail.
                         
                          KAREN
           There's a legend. If they float in
           toward shore, you'll come back some
           day. If they float out to sea, you
           won't.
                         
                          ALMA
           I won't come back. I had to get
           away from here. You see, my fiance
           was killed on December seventh.
                         
                          KAREN
           Oh, I am sorry.
                         
                          ALMA
           (quickly, as if rehearsed)
           He was a bomber pilot. He tried to
           taxi his plane off the apron and
           the Japs made a direct hit on it.
           Maybe you read about it in the
           papers. They awarded him a Silver
           Star. They sent it to his mother.

          The RADIO NOISE is drowned out by the A CAPELLA, SOPRANO
          VOICE of a young Indian boy as he sings a melodic Hindi
          prayer.

          INT. AIRPLANE CABIN --- NIGHT


          THE WORST NIGHTMARE IMAGINABLE:
          SLOW MOTION: The plane is going down fasts Everyone panics
          and screams in SLOW MOTION as the oxygen masks away like
          plastic pendulums. The SOPRANO VOICE continues the prayer.

          ANDREW LARGEMAN (LARGE), 25, is the only passenger who
          remains unfazed. Even as the flames from the wing echo fiery
          reflections on his cheeks, even as the young mother seated
          next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards God, even
          as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half-speed and
          the beverage cart slides down the aisle, Andrew Largeman sits
          peacefully; unaffected.

          He calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows
          directly on him. He looks up to

          THE FASTEN SEAT BELT SIGN

          it BINGS as the light flashes on and off. The BINGING
          continues more and more frequently; at first in rhythm with
          the prayer and then it dissolves into the RING of an

          ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          Whiteness. Morning sun streams through a palatial picture
          window. THE PHONE continues to RING. A ceiling fan spins
          above stacks of scripts, a cell phone charging, bare walls
          and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in
          which he sleeps.

          HIS BYES bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams
          like they're chasing each other in a game of tag.
          THE PHONE is finally answered by the machine. Large's eyes
          stop moving.

          LARGE'S EYES slowly float open.

          Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you
          don't call me back so I don't know
          how to do this. If I can't... if
          you're not gonna return my calls
          then there's no way for us to
          communicate. So uh...
          '(starts to cry)

          Look, I don't know how to do . this,
          but you're gonna need to come home
          now. Last night uh... Your mother
          died last night, Andrew. She uhh...
          I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But she
          uh... she drowned... last night she
          drowned in the bath...

          BEEP. The machine cuts the voice off.
          LARGE'S EYES processing.

          They elide slowly left, then back right as if scanning in
          data. He blinks. He blinks again slowly. His eyelids float
          closed. He falls back to sleep.

          FADE TO BLACK-'

                         IN BLACK:
          The RUSH OF WATER from the bathroom sink.

          INT. BATHROOM -- MORNING

          Large appears to stare directly at us. He's dazed. His body
          is there, but his mind seems absent. He reaches to the middle
          of the frame, almost at us, and pulls open both doors of the
          mirror he's been staring into.

          His face and chest are immediately replaced with the two
          dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately
          line the shelves of his medicine cabinet.

          He closes the mirror doors and stares at himself.

          MUSIC CUB., ("DON'T PANIC" BY COLDPLAY)

          EXT. CENTURY CITY PAVILION -- LATER

          Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.
          He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
          to find an address while checking a piece of paper.
          He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-
          stairs.

                         3
          After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a
          gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.
          Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.

          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
          down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
          down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
          next level. His expression never changes.

          INT. CASTING OFFICE -- DAY

          A casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and
          manilla envelopes while the PHONE RINGS constantly. Large
          sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him;
          they're even dressed alike.

                         ASSISTANT
          Casting, please hold. casting,
          please hold.

          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are sitting beneath an eight
          foot photograph of "Urkel" wagging his finger at the camera.
          A slow 360 degree pan around the room reveals ten other
          actors identical to Large aggressively rehearsing their lines
          to themselves.

          The ACTOR seated next to Large leans over to him.

                         ACTOR
          We're whores.
          Large looks at him.

           ACTOR (CONT' D )
           "I'm not a whore," you say. And to
          that I say, "If you would do
          this... that you would do ' this...
          you're a whore." 'But it pays the
          bills," you say; startin' to get a
          little pissed. And to that I say:
          "how do whores, how do you think a
          hooker justifies what she does to
          her non-hooker friends?"

          We hold on Large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his
          other side aggressively running his lines to the air.

          INT. LARGE' S CAR -- DAY

          Hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the 405
          freeway. Large stares absently out the window as BLARING
          SIRENS. compete with the obnoxious ramblings of L.A. TALK

          RADIO.
          Large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in
          pain.

          EXT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on
          his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
          restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his
          car.
          THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
          sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
          off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
          time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
          nozzle from his tank.
          He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
          the nozzle in an open dumpater.

          INT. FANCY HOLLYWOOD VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Large flings open the door and enters a long, dark corridor
          lined with stacked chairs. He passes a WAITER in a black
          TUNIC wearing eye make-up to make him look Asian.

                         WAITER
          Dick head. You've got thirty-four
          and twenty-five seated and Taylor
          booked a pilot so he quit. You
          picked a bad night to be late.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         5
          Large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any
          of the stress. He rounds a corner to a time card machine and
          swipes his card. The machine BEEPS and displays the word,
          "LATE" in red. He crosses to a locker and quickly changes
          into a black tunic and pants.
          He moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over
          thirty people in white: chopping, frying, sauteing, YELLING.
          The Vietnamese chef wears a headset and BARKS ORDERS down the
          line. Large is met by a FRENCH WOMAN MANAGER. She walks with
          him as he weaves his way through the kitchen.

                         FRENCH MANAGER

                         (FRENCH ACCENT)
          Ten resumes just today. They come
          in everyday from Idaho or Florida
          or Milwaukee and do you know what
          they want even more than a guest
          spot on "Everybody Loves Raymond"?
          They want your job. This will not
          happen again. This will never
          happen again. You have two tables.
          You are thirty minutes late; if I
          ever say this again, your job will

                         GO TO:
          She pulls off the top resume from the bunch she's grasping;
          revealing a headshot on the other side.

          FRENCH MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Todd Slauson from Duluth,
          Minnesota.
          During all this, Large remains calm and unphased. He takes a
          stick of eye make-up from the pocket of the tunic and paints
          his eyes to appear Asian. (As do all the white, good-looking,
          male waiters.)
          He takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of
          the tunic and turns it on. He unwinds the ear piece, pulls it
          through the back of his jacket, out the neck and into his
          ear. Immediately we hear a VIETNAMESE MAN'S VOICE giving
          orders over the ear piece.

          VIETNAMESE VOICE (O.S.)
          (accented, but monotone)
          Waiter number fifteen, your table
          number twenty-three is ready.
          Large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into:

          INT. DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          A very fancy Hollywood Vietnamese restaurant filled to
          capacity with a Friday evening crowd. The energy is
          completely different from the other side of the door. SOFT
          ASIAN MUSIC' plays, the room is very dim and lit by

          Large remains dead-pan as he crosses to a table with six
          young, hot Hollywood types.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY
          What the fuck, man? What are you on
          break?
          Large doesn't respond.

          YOUNG HOLLYWOOD GUY (CONT'D)
          Don't worry about it; I'm just
          messin' with ya. Lemme get three

          INT. AIRPORT BATHROOM -- DAY

          THE RUSH OF WATER as Large washes his hands at the last Oink
          in a very long row. He grabs his neck while SQUINTING his
          eyes closed in pain for a brief second.
          A moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of
          sinks. As he passes each sink, he unknowingly activates their
          motion sensors and each faucet SHOOTS a tiny burst of water.
          The NASALLY VOICE of a WOMAN SINGING an off key version of
          "Once, Twice, Three Times A Lady" with synthesizer
          accompaniment.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.
          Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking
          woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.
          We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON
          HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her
          cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
          tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:
          HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words
          "ONCE and "TWICE".
          The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew
          prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father
          GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.
          Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young
          Black woman.
          HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty
          tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the
          ceremony.
          WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the
          crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs
          26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite
          filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black
          yarmulkes.
          They look up as Large approaches.

          No bitch, he's in LA now. He's a

                         DAVE
          You should come out with us, we're

          Yeah, he lives up on the hill.
          We're probably gonna head over

          Well I gotta shower.

          INT. LARGEMAN HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - DAY

           TIGHT ON: An enormous portrait photograph that fills a wall;
          in it, Large (as a young boy), Sarah (not yet in a
          wheelchair) and Gideon Largeman huddle together with a Black
          woman and her young daughter (Cynthia) against a white
          background. They all wear white t--shirts, blue jeans and no
          socks. Everyone but Sarah smiles widely into the lens.
          "Shiva" is in full swing as forty or so older suburban Jewish
          New Jersey'ites of every shape and size mingle over small
          food and small talk. The camera moves past several

                         CONVERSATIONS:
          A heavy woman with gobs of make-up and lots of gold.

                         WOMAN 1
          .Well you had to call her; she
          never called anyone.
          A woman in a white tennis outfit talking to a group.

                         WOMAN 2
          This was a woman who never smiled.
          An older man in glasses with cream cheese all over his lips.

                         MAN 1
          Somebody ate all the lox.
          THE CAMERA MOVES TO: Two very Jewish older ladies
          simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends.

                         LADY 1
          The new thing is "Talk to the
          hand."

                         LADY 2
          That's what they're doing.

                         LADY 1
          But you got a hold it out like
          this.

                         LADY 2
          Like you're saying...

                         LADY 1
          "I don't have the time for you."

                         LADY 2
          "So talk to my hand."

                         LADY 1

          Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the
          singer from the funeral. Some young children play on the rug
          in front of them. Large stares off into space as she pets one
          of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation.

                         SYLVIA
          Did you know your mother redid the
          hallway bathroom?
          Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him.

                         LARGE
          What? Sorry. Who?

                         SYLVIA
          Since I met her she never showed an
          interest in anything. Then all of a
          sudden a month ago she wakes up and
          decides to redecorate a bathroom. I
          helped her.

                         LARGE
          That's great.
          (trying his best)
          I'll bet it was... fun.

                         SYLVIA
          Well I sew. I made you something.

                         LARGE
          Me? Thank you. Did you... sew it?

                         SYLVIA
          It's a shirt.

                         LARGE
          Great.

                         SYLVIA
          I made short sleeves... you know,
          for LA.

                         LARGE
          Great. I'll wear it.

                         SYLVIA
          Will you try it on nowt

                         LARGE
          Now?

                         SYLVIA
          Well just in case I have to fix it
          before you leave again and we don't
          see you for another nine years, I
          want to make sure it fits.

                         LARGE
          oh. okay.

                         SYLVIA
          You're gonna love the material. I
          used the leftovers from your
          Mother's design. Gorgeous.

          INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is
          done in the same floral pattern; everything: wallpaper,
          towels, curtains. He looks down at the shirt; it's the same
          pattern.
          He slides his sweater off to reveal his pale, thin chest. He
          stares at himself in the mirror for a moment. He tilts his
          head to the right and stares at his body.
          He pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front. As he does
          his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the
          room. He looks at himself in the mirror; it looks like his
          head and forearms are floating in mid-air.
          Large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in
          mid-air.

          TNT. GIDEON'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
          GIDEON LARGENAN sits alone at his desk. Large enters.

          You know I'm not really sure what
          to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry.

          From afar at the cemetery.

                         GIDEON
          She's on call tonight; she
          volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue
          Squad. She's doing so well in med
          school.

                         LARGE
          Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really
          happy that everything's working out
          so well for her. She deserves that.

                         GIDEON
          I have very fond memories of the
          two of you running around here when
          you were little kids like brother
          and sister.
          Silence.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          So how are you?

                         LARGE
          I'm okay.

                         (SEARCHING)
          I've been getting these pretty bad
          headaches lately. It feels like a
          quick little lightning storm in my
          brain and then it's gone. I was
          thinking maybe you could set me up
          to get it checked out while I'm
          here.

                         GIDEON
          Go see Dr. Cohen first thing
          tomorrow morning. Re's a
          neurologist in my building. I'll
          call him and he'll fit you in. I'm
          sure it's nothing to worry about.
          Silence. Large nods.

                         LARGE
          House looks great.

          Oh? That's nice. We've been...
          doing a lot of work on it.

          Really?

                         GTDEON
          Actually, no. I don't know why I
          just said that. We haven't done
          anything to it.

                         (BEAT)
          We cleaned it for this; for this
          whole thing. Janice has been
          cleaning.

                         LARGE
          The bathroom in the hall. I noticed
          someone redid that.

                         GIDEON
          Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You
          should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this
          whole thing together out there. I
          think there's enough food out there
          for... everybody. I mean, more.than
          everybody... there's a lot of food
          out there.

                         LARGE
          okay. I think I'll go have some..

                         LARGE
          Great.
          Large starts to leave.

                         GIDEON
          I'm glad you're here.
          Large stops in the doorway.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D}
          Saying goodbye is important. I'm
          glad you could... fit it in.
          They nod at each other. Large walks out.

          INT. LARGE 'S BEDROOM -- DAY

          A tattered, vintage American Flag site framed above the bed.
          Large eases past all the shelves; trinkets, nothing seems to
          mean anything and then

                         A PICTURE
          Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents
          laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around
          a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous "chicken-
          foot" slippers and smile from ear to ear.
          Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the
          photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not
          yet requiring a wheelchair.
          He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves
          ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's

                         A WATERBED-
          A LOUD RING from a PHONE on the bedside table which appears
          to be made out of Legos. He answers it.

                         LARGE
          Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.

          INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world War II Army
          motorcycle with a sidecar. The corner of hie mouth raises and
          holds the idea of a smile.

          MUSIC CUE: "REMY ZERO"

          EXT. STREETS NIGHT

          Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE

          MUSIC BLASTS.
          The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back
          roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by
          a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS
          FLASH behind him as he pulls over.

                         LARGE
          Fuck.
          The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search
          light.

                         COP
          Hands on your head, please!

                         LARGE
          What?

          I said PUT YOUR MOTRERFUCKING HANDS

          ON YOUR FUCKING HEAD PLEASE!21
          Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure
          standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red
          colors.

                         COP (CONT'D)

          You could have killed some little

           You do have a license don't you.
           Large takes it. out and passes it behind him, squinting. When
           the COP gets it, he steps finally into the 1 ght. He's a
          skinny kid, maybe 23, with a baby face!

                          COP (CONT'D)

          I had to grow up now, man, I wasn't
          makin' shit at the fish market. No

          A bunch of people are gathered around Mark as he tells a
          drunken story. The group laughs.

          Mark sloppily hugs Large. Others slap him five as Large
          awkwardly navigates between variations of hugs and
          handshakes.

                         DRUNK
          What are you doin home?

          They walk through the crowd as Mark recruits cute girls to
          join them upstairs. They walk up the stairs past family
          pictures and school photos made crooked by drunken backs.
          Mark points to a photo of an awkward looking young man.

          Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh?
          It pains Large to even try to respond to that.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          You want to see the most fucked up
          thing?
          They arrive at the landing outside a door with a "New Jersey

          Everything in the room is golf. it is one man's wood paneled
          shrine to the sport of golf: golf carpet, posters,

                         JESSE
          Basically, "The Man bought my
          silent Velcro patent.

          What?

                         JESSE

          right?

                         LARGE
          No. But I haven't seen you since we

                         WERE SIXTEEN-

                         JESSE
          Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an
          inventor yet. Anyway I developed
          this little item that's just like
          Velcro but doesn't make that
          annoying Velcro noise.

                         LARGE
          now much did they buy it for?

                         JESSE
          A lot.

                         LARGE
          Wow. So what are you doing now?

                         JESSE
          Nothing.
          They laugh.

                         LARGE
          Seriously.

                         JESSE
          Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've
          never been so bored in all my life.
          The first month I bought a whole
          bunch of shit, but then that got
          boring. But I... nothing.

          That's so crazy. But I mean like,
          are you gonna travel or like what
          are you gonna do? Shouldn't you
          like help starving kids or
          something?

                         JESSE
          I'm not really motivated to do much
          at all. It's kind of funny, I guess
          I had kind of planned on my whole
          life being about struggling to get
          money. But now that I've got more
          than I ever dreamed, I'm really not
          sure what to do with myself. I
          stare at walls a lot.

                         DAVE
          Can you believe that shit, Large?
          This guy has one idea and he's a
          trillionaire. I got a thousand
          ideas, but I gotta sit around and
          wait for all my relatives to die.
          They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book.
          Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that
          the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty
          young; 17-19.
          As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
          GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the
          stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone
          has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on.

                         MARK
          Here, bro.
          He passes Large the golf book.

                         LARGE
          Oh no thanks, man.

                         MARK
          Really? But you're like a movie
          star and shit.

                         LARGE
          No, no thanks.

                         JESSE
          Well then here. Eat this.
          Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY
          FACE on it.

                         JESSE (CONT'D)
          Welcome home.

                         25
          Large takes it in his hand and thinks about it. He looks
          around at everyone else in the room eating them; including
          the cute girls.

                         LARGE
          I guess I'll see youguyslater.
          He eats the hit. They laugh.

                         DANA
          Should we play a game?

                         DAVE
          other than golf?
          They laugh.

                         KELLY
          No, let's play Spin The Bottle.
          The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group.

                         LARGE

                         (TO JESSE)
          I'm not playing Spin The Bottle;
          how old are we? or more
          importantly, how old are they?
          Jesse passes Large the joint.

                         JESSE
          They're all legal. I think.
          He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy
          voice takes control.

                         KELLY
          Well we just ate all this fuckin'
          ex, what the hell else are we gonna
          do?

                         JESSE
          The girl has a point.

                         MARK
          Okay, how 'bout this.
          He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to
          neck.

                         MARK (CONT'D}
          First let's finish Daddy's golf
          tequila. Then we can use this
          bottle.
          The group loves this idea- As they laugh and party the CAIa.ERA
          FINDS ITS WAY to Large's face as he feels the weed and the
          beginning of his trip. His eyes and face navigate the ha3mnv
          start.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         26

          THE REST OF THIS SCENE WILL VACILLATE BETWEEN REGULAR, SPED-

          UP AND SLOW MOTION.
          The party seems to fast forward around Large; the MUSIC FADES
          TO ONE LOW NOTE until it breaks with people calling his name.

                         ALL
          Large!
          He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed
          directly at him.

                         JESSE
          Largeman, this is Dana.
          Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes
          with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room.

                         DANA
          Hi.

                         LARGE
          (snapping out of it)
          Oh, who's up?
          They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the
          couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in
          his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She
          stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her
          knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap.
          The MUSIC PLAYS.
          Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact.
          They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy.

          HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH
          They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek
          and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap.

                         JESSE
          This is gonna be a good night.
          Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images:
          people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls
          up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off
          his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and
          Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket.
          Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him
          in his helmet.
          FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands
          gripping a waist.
          Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the
          corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile..

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         27
          The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally:

          BLACKNESS.
          A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun
          streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame,
          eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker
          the word "BALLS" is written.
          His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs
          swing left, then right. As Large site up
          THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are

          INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

          Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning
          sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to
          highlight the duet in the air.
          A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea
          where he is.
          Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a
          person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his
          Bigfoot sighting.
          He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal
          box.
          Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval
          Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second
          and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the
          knight is gone.

          INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

          Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON,
          25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a
          cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval
          Knight.
          Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal.
          Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one
          addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On
          Large's forehead.
          Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S

          SLURPING.

                         CAROL
          it's good isn't it.
          No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          i always try to save a couple of
          marshmallows for the very end, but
          I can never make it.

                         2B
          My mind wanders and I'm left with
          flakes and pink milk. And yet each
          time I pour a bowl I tell myself
          that this time, this is gonna be
          the time I'm gonna save at least
          one.

                         LARGE
          So, Tim, how long you been working
          at medieval Times?

                         TIM
          Three years. But I've only been a
          knight for two. You have to pay
          your dues. I worked in the stables
          and helped in the kitchen.

                         CAROL
          When I started he was making the
          coleslaw. It hasn't been the same
          since you got knighted.

                         TIM
          I really just stirred it.

                         CAROL
          Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won
          the joust last night.

                         LARGE
          Congratulations.

                         TIM
          It's not that big a deal, it's
          fixed.

                         LARGE
          What was it that happened to you in
          high school? You had a thing, but
          I forgot what it was.

                         MARK
          He got the shit kicked out of him.

                         CAROL
          No he didn't.

                         MARK
          How do you know? He got the shit
          kicked out of him by Tyrell
          Freedmen.

                         LARGE
          I remember that. That was sofucked
          up. Why did he do that?

                         TIM
          I fucked him up too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         29

                         MARK
          He knocked your teeth out.

                         TIM
          He said I bit off him 'cause I got
          the same Jordans.

                         CAROL
          What?

                         LARGE
          That's right.

                         CAROL
          Who?

                         TIM
          Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I
          got the same Jordans he did. But
          his were the red ones and mine were
          all white.

                         MARX
          Yours were red too by the time he
          was done with you.
          Everybody laughs but Tim.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Air bloody tooth.

                         (BEAT)
          So what are those, like fake teeth
          you got now?

                         TIM
          He only chipped one tooth. So what
          are you up to now, Mark, digging
          graves?
          Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate.

                         CAROL
          Mark's getting into real estate.
           Silence. Mark FLICKS open his Zippo lighter and lights a
          cigarette.

                          CAROL (CONT'D)
          Tim can speak Klingon.

                         LARGE
          What?

                         TIM

          Like the Star. Trek guys?

                         CAROL
          Yup. He can talk in their language.

                         TIM
          She's kidding.

                         CAROL
          No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are
          you being shy?

                         MARK
          Don't be shy, Tim.

                         LARGE
          Yeah let's hear it, man?

                         TIM
          It's just made up. The guy who
          plays the wizard at work is a
          Trekky. I don't really...

                         CAROL
          He's being shy. Say what you said
          to me last night.

                         TIM
          No.

                         MARS
          Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her
          last night.
          Silence. Everyone stares at Tim.

                         TIM
          I gotta get going anyway.

                         MARK

                         (SHARP)
          Say what you said to her last
          night.

                         TIM
          Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo.
          They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing.

                         MARK
          You've got to be kidding me.

                         CAROL
          It means, "I like to mate after
          battle."

                         (QUICKLY)
          That's not what I said.

                         CAROL
          Yes.

                         TIM
          No, that wasn't the one I said.
          This one means "kill Kirk" and also
          'hallelujah" depending on the
          context.

                         MARK
          You must have gotten it confused
          with "Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth
          pleep."
          Theylaugh.

                         CAROL
          That was good, honey.

                         MARK
          You know what that means, Tim?

                         TIM
          No I don't know the whole language,
          I just...

                         MARK
          well I do. It means get the fuck
          out of my house before I chop your
          fuckin' head off.
          Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to
          LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop
          laughing.

                         CAROL
          Mark, he's a knight.

                         MARK
          He's just a fast-food knight.

                         TIM
          I should get going anyway.
          He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his
          chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo
          himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark
          just laugh.

                         TIM (CONT'D)
          Thanks for the cereal. By the way,
          it says "balls" on your face.
          Carol follows Tim out. Large slides to the microwave door's
          reflection.

          My Mom did it.

                         CUT TO:

          IT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- LATER
          Mark and Large sit captivated by ALLIGATORS EATING ZEBRAS on
          TV. Large's forehead is now merely smeared with black ink.
          Mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened,
          colored tube. He coughs out his hit and reclines his bare
          back against the torn pleather couch. Carol enters and stands
          next to them watching the TV.

                         CAROL
          What's this?
          She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the
          ashtray and lights it.

                         MARX
          What the fuck is that shit, Mom?

                         CAROL
          Where's this? Gimme a hit of that.

                         MARK
          Don't bring those fucking people
          here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving.
          I'm serious. No Medieval Times
          people in this house.
          He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down,
          forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_

          MARK (CONT`D)
          I'm declaring it. Now. It's
          declared, now. Thank you. No more.

                         CAROL
          Did you tell Large about the tapes?

                         MARK
          No, Ma. I'm not doin' the stupid
          tapes.

                         LARGE
          what are the tapes?

                         CAROL
          Real estate tapes. You can make up
          to a hundred thousand your first
          year. You should have seen the boat
          this one Oriental had.

                         33
          Be even had his own game show in
          China he made so much money. I
          think Mark would be perfect at it.

                         MARK
          Mom, shut-up about those fucking
          tapes. It's a scam.

                         CAROL
          It's not a scam. They show you how
          to do it. It's not hard, honey.
          Then I could retire and we could
          have our own game show.
          Carol and Large share a laugh.

                         MARK
          In China.

                         CAROL
          In China is right.

                         LARGE
          So... what, you like sell property?

                         MARK
          It's bullshit. You were just all
          baked,out and you thought it would
          be a good idea.

                         CAROL
          Well I'm doin' it. I'm savin' up
          for those tapes. 'Cause I know what
          you could be if you just applied
          yourself.

                         MARK
          I do apply myself, Mom; everyday, I
          work my ass off burying dead
          people, okay? I'm only twenty-six,
          I'm not in any rush. What's your
          rush for? Just let me be, all
          right? I don't rush you.

                         CAROL
          Well then I'm gonna do them then.

                         MARK
          Fine. Do'em.

                         CAROL
          I will and then I won't let you
          come on my yacht. Large, you're
          welcome anytime, but leave your
          friend behind.
          Large LAUGHS. She checks her watch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         34

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          Shit, I gotta go to my meeting.
          Okay.
          She stands up and then leans over and kisses Mark on the top
          of his head.

                         CAROL (CONT'D)
          Okay. Love you. Okay, bye Large
          good to see you.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. Good to see you too.
          She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark.

                         CAROL
          Don't sit in here all day you guys;
          I took the batteries outta that
          carbon monoxide detector 'cause it
          was beeping all night.
          She slams the front door.

                         MARK
          She drives me crazy. She's gets all
          fried out and makes me feel like I
          gotta impress her all the fucking
          time. And you know what? I'm okay
          with being unimpressive; I sleep
          better.
          Large site forward abruptly.

                         LARGE
          Oh not What time is it ?

          IT. NEUROLOGIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
          Large rushes in to the counter. A female Hispanic
          RECEPTIONIST looks up.

                         LARGE
          Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry.
          i'mn a little late for my
          appointment.
          She looks at her watch.

                         RECEPTIONIST

                         (SLIGHT ACCENT)
          okay, Andrew. I'm going to need you
          to fill out this paperwork for me,
          and we'll call you when we're ready
          for you.

                         LARGE
          Okay, thanks. Sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         35
          He site back down and begins filling out the form-
          The door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye-dog
          enters. The Receptionist sees her and calls out:

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Hi Mrs. Lubin.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Oh, hello there.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Just have a seat and we'll be with
          you soon.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Thank you.
          She site. Large turns back to his paperwork. He fills out a
          line before he notices the "seeing-eye-dog" has wandered over
          to him. Large looks at him.

                         LARGE
          (cold, disinterested)
          Hi, how are you?
          The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and
          proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro.
          Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind
          woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about
          to say something to her but he stops himself.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          (under his breath)
          Get off. Off.
          The dog thrusts away.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)

                         (TIGHT WHISPER)
          Stop it. Heel. No thrust.
           Finally Large gives up and decides to just let it hump away-
           He tries to return to his paperwork. Someone BURSTS OUT
          LAUGHING. Large turns to see a cute 20 year old GIRL he
          hadn't seen sitting in the corner. She wears really big
          headphones.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Got any suggestions?

                         GIRL
          Kick his balls.

                         MRS- LUSTN
          Ready for me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         36
          The girl and Large look to each other, the receptionist is
          gone.

                         GIRL

                         (IMPERSONATING

                         RECEPTIONIST)
          Not yet Mrs. Lubin.
          The dog humps away.
          The girl comes over and sits one seat away from Large.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)
          Kick his balls.

                         LARGE
          I don't want to hurt him.

                         GIRL
          It's the only way to teach them. I
          have three Dobermans. If I didn't
          kick them in the balls regularly
          I'd never get anything done.

                         LARGE
          Yeah, but I don't want to like
          destroy future generations of
          charitable dogs. Besides he's got
          to be close to finishing by now.

                         GIRL
          Not yet, here comes the lipstick.
          They sit and watch him go.

                         GIRL (CONT'D)
          Oh, he's gonna be sore tomorrow.
          WIDE SIDE ANGLE ON: the whole waiting room. Everything still
          but the dog's thrusting pelvis.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Mrs. Lubin?

          MRS. LUBIN
          Yes.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          We're ready for you.

          MRS. LUBIN
          Okay. C'mon Arthur.
          Arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her
          side to lead her into the office.

                         LARGE
          I feel so used.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         37
          She laughs.

          LARGE (CON2''D)
          Thanks for your help. Or at least
          your good intentions.

                         SAM
          I recognize you.

                         LARGE
          Oh, did you go to Columbia High?

                         SAM
          No, not from high school, from TV.
          Didn't you play the retarded
          quarterback.

                         LARGE
          (Wishing she'd go away)
          Yeah.

                         SAM
          Are you really retarded?
          He stares at her.

                         LARGE
          No.

                         SAM
          That's cool. Great job, man. You
          were- I mean I thought you were
          really retarded. You were just as
          good as that corky kid and he's
          really retarded. I mean if there's
          some kind of like retarded Emmy you
          could win. You'd kick Corky's ass.

                         LARGE
          I got to fill this thing out, but
          thank you for... that.

                         SAM
          Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an
          actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt
          you'd know him. He was on "Sheena"
          once as some gnome or something. I
          think that's great though.

                         LARGE
          Thank you.

                         SAM
          Oh that last scene where you make
          that speech to the whole stadium
          and your Dad gives you the thumbs
          up; that was - it was emotional. I
          mean I didn't cry, but I think my
          Dad did.

          I couldn't totally see, but he got
          up to go to the bathroom and I
          think I heard him sniffle. Could've
          been dander...

                         LARGE
          Well thanks. Thank you.

          So are you doing anything else?

          No. Not right now I'm just...

                         SAM
          Any other retarded roles? I'm sure
          you could definitely get more of
          those.

          No, I'm just auditioning and.,.

                         SAM
          I can't believe you're not really
          retarded. Jake's not a very good
          actor. I mean on "Sheens" you
          couldn't really tell 'cause he was
          in a hairy gnome suit, but he used
          to put on these really low-budge
          renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber
          musicals in our attic when we were
          kids and they were awful. It sucks
          'cause there isn't a whole lotta
          work for little people, you know?
          Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill
          out your forms.
          Large just stares at her. She's funny.

          After a moment, he takes the phones off and hands them back
          to her. The SONG CONTINUES SOFTLY from the headphones.

          It was nice meeting you.

          Large turns to Sam. She looks away.

          INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY

          Large site alone in a barren office. He pans around the room
          staring at all the diplomas. His eyes follow them up from the
          base-board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal: there's
          actually one on the ceiling. The doctor enters.

                         DOCTOR
          Mr. Andrew Largeman.

                         LARGE
          Yes - hi.

                         DOCTOR
          There's absolutely nothing wrong
          with you.
          Large stares.

                         LARGE
          What?

                         DOCTOR
          I'm just kidding, how would I know
          that?

                         LARGE
          Yeah.
          They shape hands.

                         DOCTOR
          I'm Doctor Cohen. What can we do
          for you today, Andrew?

                         LARGE
          I've been having these really
          intense headaches. They only last
          for a split second and then they're
          gone. It's like a lightning flash;
          almost like a surge of electricity
          and then it's gone.
          He looks at the chart.

                         DOCTOR
          You're Gideon's kid. I didn't even
          put the two together.

          I must have missed you at Shiva
          last night.

                         LARGE
          Yeah.

                         DOCTOR
          So how long have these headaches
          been going on?

                         LARGE
          Well I think I've had them in some
          form since I was a little kid. But
          they've been getting more and more
          frequent over the last year.

                         DOCTOR
          (looking at chart)
          How long have you been on the
          Lithium?

                         LARGE
          Oh uh, I've been on some form of it
          since I was ten or so.

                         DOCTOR
          And what about Paxil, Zoloft,
          Celexa, Depakote; did any of that
          ever help you?

                         LARGE
          No. I mean I don't know. It's
          recently occurred to me that I
          might not even have a problem. only
          I'd never know it, because as far
          back as I can remember I've been
          medicated. I grew up on it. I left
          them in LA. This is the first time
          I haven't had it in my body since I
          can remember.

                         DOCTOR
          Well it'll leave your body pretty
          fast. I'll write you a
          prescription.

                         LARGE
          Actually I. was thinking about
          taking a little vacation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Â¢ 42

                         DOCTOR
          Have you spoken to your
          psychiatrist about that?

                         LARGE
          E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad.
          So uh... he... I think he'd prefer
          me to stay on it. He likes to think
          it makes me happy. And I let him
          think that because he's sort of
          consumed by the idea of making
          everyone happy.

                         DOCTOR
          Well look, I'll examine you and
          give you a Catscan just so you
          won't worry that it's anything
          serious. But to be honest, I think
          the headaches are something else.
          Our bodies do very funny things
          when they're consumed with stress
          and anxiety. Things you'd never
          expect. I found my ex-best friend's
          cuff links in my wife's puree and I
          couldn't get an erection for a year
          and a half.

                         (BEAT)
          For example.

                         LARGE
          But that doesn't really feel like
          it. I mean I don't feel stressed or
          really anxious at all.

                         DOCTOR
          Well with all the Lithium he's had
          you on it's amazing you can even
          hear me right now_

                         LARGE
          Oh, right.

                         DOCTOR
          First of all, I do think you need
          to find a psychiatrist that isn't
          your father. That just's something
          that should have been remedied
          years ago. He knows better.
          Secondly, I'm not in a position to
          comment on whether or not you
          should stay on the meds or not; I
          don't know your story. But my
          opinion, since you're paying for
          it, is that those drugs may help as
          a means to an end. But if you're
          not In any sort of therapy, sooner
          or later what's ever going on in
          your mind will find a way to peek
          it's little head out of the water.
          Just something to think about.

          INT. CATSCAN ROOM - LATER

          AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on
          a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel.
          AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the
          OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his
          chest.
          THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being
          sucked.into the Catscan tunnel.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

          Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus
          stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack
          and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand.
          He pulls up alongside her.

                         LARGE
          Why were you really there?

                         SAM
          Charging. I'm a robot.

                         LARGE
          Do you lie a lot?

                         SAN
          What do you consider a lot?

                         LARGE
          Enough for people to call you a
          liar.

                         SAM
          People call me lots of things.

                         LARGE
          Is one of them "liar"?

                         SAM
          I could say "no", but how will you
          know I'm not lying.

                         LARGE
          Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.

                         SAM
          You can do that?

          I can try.

                         SAM
          Who's bike is this?

                         LARGE
          It was my grandfather's. It was the
          only thing he left to anyone in my
          family and he left it to me. And I
          like it.

                         SAM
          This is the point where you ask me
          if I'd like a ride home?

                         LARGE
          It is?

                         SAM
          Yup.

                         LARGE
          Would you like a ride home?

                         SAM
          Fine, but I ' m not getting in that
          sidecar,

                         LARGE
          Why not?

                         SAM
          Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone
          who gets in that thing is
          automatically your bitch. Thus, I
          will ride on the back.
          She climbs on the back behind him.

          What are you like... a hanglider?
          They drive off.

          EXT NJ STREET/MOVING---DAY

                         SAM
          I thought my boyfriend was gonna
          pick me up on his bike, so I
          brought it... But then he couldn't
          so...

                         LARGE
          So what, it's like one of those
          tandem things?

          this thing.

                         LARGE
          But what kind of helmet is that?

                         SAM
          You can use it on a motorcycle.
          Anyway, how's your head?

                         LARGE
          I should live through the day.

                         SAM
          Cool. Make a right here.
          They stop at a light.

                         LARGE
          Are you doing anything right now?

                         SAM
          Can you elaborate on "doing
          anything"?

                         LARGE
          Well, I just had this idea. I
          promised this guy I'd stop by his
          house that's right up here, but I
          don't really wanna stay very long.
          So I was just thinking if you came
          with me I could say I have to take
          you home when I'm ready to go.

                         SAM
          Wow. well that's pretty damn random
          of ya, Andrew.

                         LARGE
          I know.

                         SAM
          'Nice to meet you. May I use you?'
          That's the Hollywood in ya I guess.

                         LARGE
          No, it's not like that, c'mon.
          It'll be fun. I promise.

                         (BEAT)
          I'll tell you what. We'll have like
          a signal. When you pull on your ear
          that's the code and then I'll say,,
          "Well I've got to get her home
          now." And then we'll go.
          She mulls it over.

          Can we have code names too?

                         LARGE
          If you'd like.

                         SAM
          okay. But don't try and like
          kidnap me or anything, because my
          step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I
          could have you tracked and killed.

          Liar.
          The light changes and they drive off.

          EXT. JESSE'S MANSION'S FRONT YARD - DAY

          The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools,
          fountains. Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an
          enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow
          is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips. Sam and Large look
          terrified.

                         JESSE
          'Kay ready?
          He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them
          scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will
          land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot.
          Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard.

          Sam and Large stand on the front porch of her working class
          house.

          I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
          you've ever brought home?

                         (YES)
          No. But I lied about my boyfriend
          driving a t.inja.

                         LARGE
          He doesn't drive a bike?

                         SAM
          No, I don't have a boyfriend.

                         (BEAT)
          He might drive a bike; wherever he
          is.

          Well we're off to a great start.

                         SAM
          okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird,
          man. About random stuff too; and I
          don't even know why I do it. It's
          like a tick. I swear, sometimes I
          hear myself say something and then
          I think: "Wow, that's not even
          remotely true.

                         LARGE
          So how am I supposed to know what's
          real?

          sit there and not help those
          children. So we sent him letters
          and pictures for years and then I
          got really into ice skating and we
          kind of forgot about'em. Then one
          day the phone rang and it was
          Titembay and he was at the dry
          cleaners around the corner and he
          said that he was going to school at
          Rutgers and living in the dorms,

          has never, ever been done before
          and will never be copied throughout
          human existence. If nothing else,
          you'll be remembered as the only
          person who ever did this.
          He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his
          index finger in the air and twirlsa it.

          How was that?

                         SAM
          Oh, I've done that one before.
          She bursts out laughing. He smiles.
          SAM (CONT ' t3 )
          So I got to bury this hamster
          before the dogs eat him. You warms
          help?

          EXT. SAWS BACKYARD-- DAY

          Rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty
          above-ground swimming pool. Sam carries the shoe box as they
          walk around behind the pool to reveal

          A SMALL GATED PET CEMETERY
          About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different
          pets.

                         LARGE
          Wow.

                         SAM
          Yeah.

                         LARGE
          I mean this is...

                         SAM
          I know.
          They stand in silence.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          It's not that we're bad pet owners
          or anything, it's just that we've
          had so many of them over the years.

                         (BEAT)
          Besides some of these are fish.

                         (BEAT)
          Not to say fish deserve less than
          other animals, but moat people just
          flush them, and we just don't
          believe in that. I mean the idea of
          flushing something that had life in
          it... it just makes me sad, you
          know?

                         56
          You gotta honor something a little
          more than that, like
          "Congratulations, man, you had
          life. Here's your trophy; a little
          spot in the ground to hang out in."

          Anyway, I'm gonna put Jelly right
          here next to "Goliath", the
          Rotweiler Titembay backed over
          during his driving exam.
          She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left
          nearby. Large sits down next to her and watches her dig. A
          brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth.

          No. A second ago before I asked.

                         LARGE
          Uh... Right now I was thinking... I
          was thinking that I've been going
          to a lot of these things lately.

                         SAM
          What, dates?

                         LARGE
          No, not dates. This isn't a date.
          Is this a date? Funerals.

          Oh. Who else died?

          Yeah, I uh... I haven't even really
          told you that yet, but uh... yeah
          my Mom just died.

          God, it's weird to say that out

                         (SHOCKED)
          I'm so sorry. Oh, God I'm so sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          And here I am putting you through
          another one. I mean not that
          Jelly's even comes close to your
          Mom's. .. Although we loved, Jelly--
          But still... I'm so sorry. I didn't
          know.

                         LARGE
          No, it's okay. It's okay actually.
          I'm all right with it. Anyway I
          think it's what she wanted so..,

                         SAM
          How did she die?
          Large thinks about that.

          SAM (CONT ' D)
          I'm sorry, I'm so nosey. Forget I
          asked, I'm sorry. I just need to
          shut--up sometimes.

                         LARGE
          No, its okay. She uh... she
          drowned actually.
          Sam's jaw drops.

                          LARGE (CONT'D)
          My Mom was a paraplegic; she had
          uh... she was in a wheelchair. She
          was uh... taking a bath and then I
          guess she slipped or something.
          That's what they say. I don't know.
          But needless to say, she drowned.
          And so... that's how she died.
          Sam is speechless. Tears well in her eyes.

                         SAM
          When?

                         LARGE
          This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.

                         SAM
          Oh my God.
          Tears roll down her face.

                         LARGE
          (with a laugh)
          Why are you crying?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         58

                         SAM
          I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not
          usually like this. It's just so
          sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It
          is. It's like real life tragedy or
          something.

                         LARGE
          Look, let's change the subject,
          okay? Let's really bring the focus
          back to Jelly. I mean what could be
          ruder than talking about someone
          else who died while you're in the
          act of burying a close friend.
          Sam places the box in the hole she's dug.

                         SAM
          What should we do?

                         LARGE
          Well IIve only been to one of these
          things,
          (re: the other graves)
          you appear to be the expert.

                         SAM
          We usually say something.

                         LARGE
          okay, well I'll go first. I didn't
          really know you, Jelly. But from
          what I hear, you were a good pet.
          Had a little trouble with the
          wheel...

                         SAM
          its not funny. Jelly you were a
          great pet.
          Tears roll down her face.

                         SAM (CONT'O)
          I'm so, so sorry I forgot to take
          the wheel out of the cage. I'm so
          sorry about that.

                         (BEAT)
          Goodbye. I hope that you liked me.
          Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny
          shoe box. THE PATTER of the SOIL HITTING the BOX is the only
          sound we hear as:
          THE CAMERA CRANES UP above them to a bird's-eye perspective
          settling on a final frame that looks down on the whole
          backyard: the above ground pool, the pet cemetery and in the
          bottom right corner, Sam burying as Large watches.

          INT. LARGEMAN MANSION: LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Once again Shiva is in full swing.
          Large passes through a doorway and begins to hear a
          COMPUTERIZED SEEPING to the tune of the "ShmaÂ°. (A Jewish
          prayer.) He looks to his left to see an electronic Mazooza on
          the door frame. it says The Sharper image" on the bottom.
          He moves his head back and forth past it's censor and each
          time it begins the BEEPING of the Shma anew.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          A tired looking man in his 50's eating a cookie.

                         TIRED MAN
          Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to
          be musicals. As in Broadway
          musicals. Can you believe that?
          Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I
          got to do the Elora with Mookie
          Wilson. Miriam and I were at one
          last weekend at the Pierre; whole
          thing was like a winter
          wonderland... live penguins wearing
          yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out
          ten grand alone for some asshole to
          build a barricade of French garbage
          across the boccie lanes at my
          tennis club.
          THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he
          approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on
          her lap.

                         LARGE
          I was just thinking-

                         (BEAT)
          I was just thinking you spend
          you're whole life lusting for
          anything you don't have. You stress
          over money and your career, you set
          your clocks back, you exercise, you
          wait in line, you paint your house,
          get depressed, feel better, buy
          things, take your clothes to the
          dry cleaner, set your clocks
          forward and spend your whole life
          waiting for happiness to arrive in
          the mail. Then you die and people
          are really sad, they cry really
          hard...

          and then they go eat lunch.

          That's so unoriginal. I'd rather
          hold onto who I imagined you'd
          become.

                         LARGE
          Miss me?

                         CYNTHIA
          No. Me?

                         LARGE
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          She didn't like being alive. She
          got what she wanted. This should be
          a party. Instead we're supposed to
          mope. About what? She never did
          anything.

                         CYNTHIA
          She made you.

                         LARGE
          some trophy. I do have to say I'm
          impressed with the turnout.

                         CYNTHIA
          What, you didn't think people would
          come?

                         LARGE
          Seems to me the only thing more
          depressing than a funeral is a
          funeral where no one shows up.
          Don't you ever think about who'll
          show up to yours?

                         CYNTHIA
          No. Right now I'm alive, so I think
          about living.

                         LARGE
          It's one way to determine who your
          friends are. The people who'd show
          up at my funeral if it was held in
          their state, that's one level of
          friend. But my real friends, the
          people who really love me, they'd
          come if it was on the other side of
          the country.

                         CYNTHIA
          So where do I fall into that?

                         LARGE
          You'd be there.

                         CYNTHIA
          Oh you think so?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         61

                         LARGE
          I do. I think you'd show up because
          the truth is, that you really did
          miss met you always thought of me
          as the brother you never had. But
          you've got too much pride to let me
          know that. You want to pout 'cause
          I don't return your calls.

                         CYNTHIA
          you're way more talkative than I
          remember.

                         LARGE
          Today I've been more talkative than
          I remember.

                         CYNTHIA
          What about mine?

                         LARGE
          Funeral? Honestly? I probably
          wouldn't travel for it- no. But
          don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a
          great turnout.

                         CYNTHIA
          Why do you say that?

                         LARGE
          'Cause there's also the guy who
          lives his life to insure a good
          turnout. I think that's how my Dad
          lives his-, like he's sort of
          writing his own eulogy as he goes
          and making life choices dependent
          on how it will sound in a speech.

                         CYNTHIA
          Are you implying that that's why
          I'm going to med school or
          something?

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying a lot of people -
          not necessarily you - a lot of
          people try and accumulate accolades
          that will somehow justify their
          lives.

                         CYNTHIA
          It's said we spend ninety-five
          percent of our lives trying to look
          good.

                         LARGE
          Where do I sign up for not caring?

                         CYNTHIA
          How about sucking it up and really
          having it out with your Dad? That
          would be a tremendous step towards
          not needing to look good.

          Wow, that was so clever how you did
          that. Is he grooming you to be a
          psychiatrist too? Med school's one
          thing, but please don't become him.

                         CYNTHIA
          He's one of the most caring people
          I've ever met.

                         LARGE
          well you would say that; you're the
          son and daughter he never had.
          Hell, you're the family he never
          had. Has he got you on Lithium
          yet? Wait till he does, you'll love
          him even more.
          He stands.

                         CYNTHIA
          I bet my Mom a dollar you were
          coming home with a message. I said
          after nine years, he's definitely
          coming home with a message.

                         LARGE
          i looked for a message; I got bored
          and became an actor.
          He leaves.

          INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

          Large enters the kitchen where JANICE, 50's, Cynthia's Mom,
          is doing the dishes. He walks over to the counter near the
          sink and just stares off across the room. She dries her hands
          and moves to Large. She opens her arms. After a beat he steps
          into her embrace. He rests his head on her shoulder and
          closes his eyes. Neither says a word.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          LARGE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
          Morning sun blasts the entire room. Large site on the edge of
          his bed squinting at pictures:

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          Large peeks his head around the doorway.

                         LARGE
          Hello?

                         (BEAT)
          Dad?
          After shutting the door behind himself he' crosses to the
          dresser and lifts one perfume bottle out from a dozen. He
          smells the nozzle then brings the bottle with him as he edges
          towards...

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM --- CONTINUOUS

          The bathroom is stark white. A large Jacuzzi tub sits at the
          far end of the room. The faucet drips.

          THE MOUTH OF THE FAUCET
          as it wells with water and overflows to DRIP onto the drain.
          Large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to
          stop it from dripping. It continues to DRIP. He stares at the
          empty tub.

          GIDEON (O.S.)
          Hi.
          Large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest.

                         LARGE
          Holy shit, you scared the shit out
          of me.
          He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket.

                         GIDEON
          Just wake up?

                         LARGE
          Yeah.

                         GIDEON
          Sleep all right?

                         LARGE
          Yeah... fine.

                         GIDEON
          Mmmm.

                         (BEAT)
          I haven't even really been in here
          for a while. I've been using the
          one in the hall. Shower pressures
          awful in there though. It's by no
          means as good a bathroom as this
          one is. This one is- well we redid
          all this. Its uh...
          (beat, catching himself)
          This is hard.

                         LARGE
          Yeah.
          Silence. The FAUCET DRIPS. They avoid eye contact.

                         GIDEON
          Janice will make you some lunch.

                         LARGE
          Yeah... good.

                         GIDEON
          Well I guess it's breakfast for
          you. What time is it?

                         LARGE
          Yeah.
          Silence. DRIP. DRIP

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I wanted to ask you... I mean
          if you don't want to talk about
          this its perfectly fine, but I'm
          just...

                         GIDEON
          No I can. I know. I figured you
          would want to...

                         LARGE
          But we don't have to do it now. I
          mean you don't have to do that now.
          It's just at some point I would...
          I have some questions.

                         GIDEON
          I knew that you would.
          Silence.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          Occasionally she would hum.., your
          Mother. Always the same tune and I
          never knew what the song was. I
          don't even know if it was a song or
          if she just made it up - It's funny
          because it always struck me as so
          out of character for her and every
          time she did it... I just always
          liked it. But I never told her I
          could hear her because I knew if I
          ever did she would stop.

                         (BEAT)
          She took a bath every night. And
          she was always very quiet.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         65
          The only thing I would ever hear
          when I'm in the bedroom was a
          little splashing of water when she
          was moving around. And every now
          and then, her humming.

                         (BEAT)
          so anyway, then usually she would
          call me when she was done, so I
          could come and help her out. But
          this time, that night... she never
          called. And I just figured she was
          taking a longer bath or something,
          but when I called out to her, she
          didn't answer. So then I uh... When
          I came in, she was there.

                         LARGE
          So she didn't yell or...

                         GIDEON
          No. I didn't hear anything. The TV
          was on pretty loud. I always watch
          the weather report before I go to
          sleep.

                         LARGE
          It's just weird.

                         GIDEON
          What?

                         LARGE
          I don't know, it's just that you'd
          think if someone was really
          drowning to death they would
          scream. I mean really scream from
          the terror of it all, you know?
          They would splash and scream I
          would think; I would have thought.

                         GIDEON
          I would have too, but no. Nothing.
          (off Large's look)
          What?

                         LARGE
          Don't take this the wrong way.

                         GIDEON
          What ?

                         LARGE
          I'm not reading into this, I'm just
          thinking out loud so don't get

                         UPSET-

                         GIDEON
          What? No.

                         LARGE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         66

                         GIDEON
          Its not that.

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying did they check? I
          mean has someone ruled that out?

                         GIDEON
          No. Because they know she drowned,
          Andrew.

                         LARGE
          I'm just saying the facts.

                         GIDEON
          No.

                         LARGE
          And I suppose it doesn't even
          really matter. But I'd be curious
          to know. I would like to know if
          that's what happened; just for me.
          I mean would that surprise you?

                         GIDEON
          No. Yee!

                         LARGE
          She made it very clear to everyone
          she knew that nothing was ever
          going to make her happy-

                         GIDEON
          I know! Do you think I don't know?!

                         LARGE
          And c'mon let's be honest; she
          tried it before.

                         GIDEON
          Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking
          mouth.
          Large is taken aback.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)

                         (FIGHTING TEARS)
          If nothing else will you please
          just leave, her alone. She's gone.
          That's it. That's all you get. She
          died. We will never see her again.
          She tried very hard, but she just
          couldn't find it. She could never
          find it. And I think - I know that
          she's found it now. I know that.
          And I know there's a certain amount
          of guilt that you must feel for the
          way things unfolded, but it's too
          late now.

                         67
          So I'm asking you, for me, not to
          do that. Don't... come here and do
          that.

                         LARGE
          I think I deserve to know the
          truth.

                         GIDEON
          You want to make her crazy. Why?
          Does that make it easier for you?
          Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet
          and cries.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          It's like you want to torture
          yourself or something! Why would
          you want to think that? That that
          happened. Why would you ever want
          to think that?
          Large moves closer to his father who SOBS with his head in
          his lap and his arms over his head. It takes everything Large
          has to reach out his hand and almost touch his father's
          shoulder, but he doesn't make it and his hand lands on the
          sink next to him.

                         GIDEON (CONT'D)
          I just want everyone to be happy
          again.

                         (BEAT)
          I dreamt last night that I had
          special powers. If I squeezed my
          eyes shut and clinched my fiats
          closed tight enough, we'd all wake
          up in paradise.
          (with a laugh through

                         TEARS)
          I was like a superhero... and that
          was my power.

          Sam and Large are looking through a photo album. Olivia
          enters with an enormous Parrot on her shoulder.

                         OLIVIA
          Andrew would you like to see Sam's
          ice skating tape?

          Mom, no.

                         LARGE
          Absolutely.

                         OLIVIA
          She was so ahead of her time. She
          could have gone to the Olympics.

                         SAM
          No, I couldn't have.

                         OLIVIA
          Yes, you could have. Don't blame it
          on the epilepsy, you had a gift.
          Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him-

                         LARGE
          C'mon let me see it.

          Mom. I'm asking you seriously.

          Don't be shy. Just let me see it.

                         OLIVIA
          Oh, she wants you to see it. How
          could you not want him to see how
          talented you are?

                         SAM
          Were.
          They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing
          rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the
          coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text
          book. White powder reveals fingerprints (and pawprints)
          everywhere, including the TV screen.

          Honey what are you doing?

                         TITEMBAY
          I'm dusting for prints.

          But someone's been pissing on my
          Gamecube and I'm about to close the
          case.

                         OLIVIA
          It wasn't me your honor.

          The pawprints point to a canine.

                         OLIVIA
          Andrew come sit down here next to
          me.
          Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring
          Dobermans. He places his glass of water on the table. Sam
          stands in the doorway.

                         SAM
          I can't believe you're showing him
          this.

          THE SHAKY, AMATEUR VIDEO comes up on the screen: a person in
          a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the
          ice. The lights come down except for a spotlight on the
          alligator.

                         OLIVIA
          There she is.

                         LARGE
          You're the alligator?

                         OLIVIA
          You can tell by the hands.
          The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on
          the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is
          a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful.

                         TITEMBAY
          Here comes the Double Axle...

                         OLIVIA
          And... land! I mean come on. Isn't
          she good?
          Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in
          the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them
          back on.

          right you were amazing.
          Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water
          glass revealing his fingerprints.

                         SAM
          Okay this was great, but we have to
          go now.

          INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           Sam and Large sit in a booth of a local Irish pub drinki ng
           pints. They're buzzed.

                         LARGE
          It was the only thing I ever really
          liked doing; pretending to be
          someone else.

                         (BEAT)
          But I've been so out of it the only

          play handicapped people.

          It's not funny.

                         SAM
          Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a
          joke. If you can't laugh at
          yourself life's gonna seem a lot
          longer than you'd like.

                         LARGE
          So what should we laugh at you
          about?

                         SAM
          I lied again. I have epilepsy.

                         LARGE
          Which part are we laughing about?

                         SAM
          I had a seizure in the law office
          where I work and they said their
          insurance would only cover me if I
          wore "preventative covering".

          The helmet I was carrying.
          Large is silent.

          SAM (CONT' D)
          Oh come on, that's funny. I'm the
          only person in the world wearing a
          helmet to work who isn't putting
          out fires or racing for NASCAR. But
          what do you do? I can't quit; their
          insurance is amazing. What can you
          do? You laugh. I'm not saying I
          don't cry a lot, but in between I
          laugh and realize how silly taking
          anything very seriously is. And
          plus, I look forward to a good cry.
          I just love the way it feels.

                         LARGE
          I haven't cried since I was a
          little kid. I didn't cry at my
          mother's funeral. I wanted to-

                         (A SMILE)
          I... tried. I thought of all the
          saddest things I could think of;
          things in movies, this image from
          Life magazine that haunts me...
          nothing came.

          That actually made me sadder than
          anything; the fact that I felt no
          numb.

          EXT. JESSE'S POOL -- NIGHT

          A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion.
          The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance.
          Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school
          girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of
          the pool.

                         MARK
          One, two, three!
          Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He
          stands there staring at the water.

          Hey! what are you doing?

          Dude maybe you should stay on the
          steps; I don't know CPR.

          You look like a drunken beaver.
          They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps.
          She smiles at him.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          You know that point in your life
          when you realize that the home you
          grew up in isn't really your home
          anymore? And all of a sudden, even
          though you have a place where you
          put your Shit, the idea of "home',
          is gone.

                         SAM
          I still feel at home in my house.

                         LARGE
          You'll gee when you move out. It
          just kind of happens one day and
          it's gone. And you feel like you
          can never get it back. it's like
          you feel homesick for a place that
          doesn't even exist. But maybe it's
          like this rite of passage, you
          know? And you won't ever have that
          feeling again until you create a
          A new idea of "home" for yourself,
          for the family you start, for your
          kids. It's like this cycle.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe that's all a family really
          is; a group of people who miss the
          same imaginary place.
          They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings
          their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam
          leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.

                         SAM
          Maybe.

          INT. JESSE'S MANSION: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

          An enormous and desolate LIVING ROOM devoid of any furniture
          or decoration. Mark, Jesse, Sam and Large sit huddled under
          towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a
          small blaze. They eat potato chips and drink canned beer.
          They are all pretty tipsy. Mark plays with a "Silent Velcro"

          They all laugh.

          So why did they send you away?
          She takes a sip of her beer.

          involved.

          me and sent me to my room, but this
          time, in that moment, the door of
          the dishwasher was open. The latch
          on it was broken and it would just
          randomly fall open. That fucking
          latch; it's funny how so much of my
          life hasbeendetermined by a
          quarterinchpiece of plastic. So
          she fellbackover the door and her
          neck hitthekitchen counter;
          paralyzing her from the waist down.

          Well I was nine. They sent me to
          therapy and my Father put me on
          these drugs that were supposed to
          "curb my anger". And I've been on
          some form of them ever since. My
          Mother who was clinically depressed
          before the accident, sank even
          lower to the point where she just
          ignored everyone but our
          housekeeper, Janice and her
          daughter, Cynthia. And when I was
          sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came
          around to the conclusion that it
          might not be the healthiest
          environment for me to be growing up
          in. So he sent me to boarding
          school. And I haven't been home

                         SAM
          Nice to meet you.

                         CYNTHIA
          You too.
          Sam leaves them alone.

          I should go.

          You know me enough to know I'd
          travel for your funeral right? I
          was kidding yesterday; where ever
          it was... you know I'd be there
          right?

                         CYNTHIA
          Yes.
          He backs away and mounts his bike. Cynthia turns to the
          stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear,welling
          in her eye.

          INT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS/ROUTE 22 --- MORNING

          Mark, Sam and Large enter the tacky lobby. Mark carries the
          gym bag.
          Large and Sam follow Mark down a corridor and into a vending
          machine room. He opens a door labeled "Private" into a
          kitchen area. They weave through the kitchen down another
          hall...

          INT. BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          They arrive at a locked door. Mark knocks.
          After a beat it's opened by an Asian teenager with bad acne
          blasting his walkman. The far wall is entirely covered with a
          blown-up mural of a New Jersey Driver's License used for
          making fake ID's. The space where the face would go is
          missing, revealing an opening in the wall. They climb
          through.

          INT. SECRET HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS


          DURING THE FOLLOWING SCENE, THE CHARACTERS WILL ONLY WHISPER

          IN EACH OTHER'S EARS. WE WILL ONLY KNOW WHAT THEY ' RE SAYING

          FROM SUBTITLES.
          They squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti.
          They come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in
          the wall. Mark taps him on the shoulder. He turns his head
          and nods in recognition.
          When he pulls away from the peep hole, the LIGHT PROJECTS THE

          IMAGE OF THE MOTEL ROOM ON HIS FACE .

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         94
          (Yes, that really happens.) As he looks at Mark, Sam and
          Large, his forehead is filled with the image of a BUSINESS
          MAN brushing his teeth. Mark leans into his ear.

                         MARK

                         (SUBTITLED)
          Down the hall. There's a hooker in
          room 112.. It's crazy down there. I
          figured I'd just chill with this.
          SLOW MOTION: Mark gestures for Large and Sam to follow him
          down the hall. The hall is strewn with young men staring
          into peep holes. As Mark, Sam and Large pass them, the
          Peeping Tom's each turn to see who it is.
          As they turn, each one has the image of what they're watching
          projected on their face. We hear the ECHOES of the SOUNDS
          FROM the ROOMS.
          -- An old couple slow dancing projected on another teen.
          REGULAR MOTION: They arrive at the end of the hall where a
          group of six young guys are glued to the image being
          projected onto the wall opposite the peep hole. An old camera
          lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image
          to appear in perfect focus.
          The projection shows a very hot, YOUNG HOOKER getting taken
          from behind by an OLDER GREASEBALL. Her face is no more than
          three feet from the peep hole. The HOOKER'S MUFFLED MOANING
          can be heard from the other side of the wall.
          Everyone's eyes are glued to the wall. Large notices one kid
          has duct tape over his mouth, while another is sweating
          profusely. Sam's jaw is dropped open.

          GRBASESALL (0.5.)
          I'm fucking you! I'm fucking you.
          Large notices another kid lip-synching along with the
          Greaseball. Mark spots DIEGO, a Hispanic guy, 32, wearing a
          bell-hop uniform and gestures him closer.

          Who's fuckin' you? Hub? Who's
          fuckin' you?
          The Lip-Synching Kid mouths, "You are."

          Dude we're kind of in a rush.

                         DIEGO
          You can wait, he's about to cunt.

                         GREASEBALL
          I'm gonna fucking cum!
          Diegogestures, "Told you."

                         HOOKER
          Cum on my back!
          The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs
          his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we

          Mark, Diego, Large, Sam and others rush out into the outer
          room.They speak in quiet whispers.

          How do you know she's a hooker?

                         DIEGO
          of course she's a fucking hooker.
          Girls that look like her do not
          fuck guys that look like him unless
          it's for money, coke or fame.

          They play wrestle as Sam watches.

          EXT. KIERNAN'S QUARRY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...

          AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY
          Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
          distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.
          The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the
          bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift
          overhead. This glace is surreal.

          Wow.

          broke through into this like
          natural phenomenon. It's like an
          underground Grand Canyon or
          something. So now they're in some

          alongside the abyss.

          Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop
          handle he's found as a walking stick.
          As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
          cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,
          remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
          Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
          FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
          sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
          and welcoming.
          Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
          expected. Rain begins to fall.

          steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.

          After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-

          (with a smile)
          Yes. Come on in out of the rain.
          Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-
          frame ladder that sits next to the hull.

          INT. ALBERT'S BOAT -- CONTINUOUS

          They step inside and the door closes behind them. It's very
          cozy and warm. GREAT MUSIC PLAYS. A wood burning stove heats
          the room and throws warm amber light onto a small LIVING ROOM
          with deep cushy couches.

                         ALBERT
          You guys must be freezing. Make
          yourselves warm by the fire. I'm
          just gonna go put her down. I'll be
          right out.
          The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet
          whispers.

                         SAM
          I must say, I've been continually
          impressed today with how each new
          place you bring us manages to be
          weirder and weirder.

                         MARK
          What do you mean, this is nice.

                         LARGE
          ah nothing, just hanging out in an
          old boat at the bottom of a quarry
          in Newark.

                         MARK
          It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did
          you see that cliff?
          Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring
          looking woman in her early thirties.

                         ALBERT
          This is my wife, Faye.

                         ALL
          Hi. Hello.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101

                         FAYE
          Hi. Welcome.

                         ALBERT
          This is Mark and Sam and Large,
          right?

                         MARK

                         YEAH_

                         ALBERT
          Diego told me when he called.
          Please have a seat, make yourselves
          comfortable.

                         FAYE
          Its really coming down out there,
          huh?

                         LARGE
          Yeah, it just started pouring all
          of a sudden.

                         ALBERT
          Well in a bad storm I like to
          pretend this old boat's my own
          private "ark". Unfortunately, if
          this is the apocalypse, I'm not
          quite sure it still floats.

                         FAYE
          Would any of you like some tea?

                         SAM
          I'd love some tea.
          Large and Mark look at her.

                         LARGE
          No thanks.

                         MARX
          No.. thanks.
          Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely
          nodding at each other.

                         LARGE
          What is it that you do here? What
          is this place?

                         ALBERT
          Good question. We're calling it
          Kiernan's Fault. And no one's
          really quite sure what it is
          because they haven't been able to
          explore it. They're locked in a
          legal battle over who has the
          rights to the land.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         102
          So one of these days it will either
          be a national park or a shopping
          mall. But while their locked in
          litigation, I was hired to make
          sure no one comes inside.

                         LARGE
          Oh. Wow.

                         ALBERT
          What they don't know is that I'm a
          geologist working undercover for
          the preservation lobby. So, at
          night... I go down.

                         FAYE
          He's documenting it to support
          their case.

                         SAM
          Wow. So how deep does it go?

                         ALBERT
          No one really knows. I've been in
          the furthest and that was about two
          miles down. But I like to pretend
          it's infinite.

                         11
          Faye brings them tea.

                         SAM
          It's kind of an odd job isn't it?
          Guardian of an infinite abyss?

                         ALBERT
          Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade
          and deal in antique jewelry. I
          suppose it's pretty odd for you that
          we live down here like this-

                         SAM
          No.

                         LARGE
          Not at all.

                         MARK
          Never crossed my mind.

                         ALBERT
          But we think it's important.

                         LARGE
          Why? What do you think you'll find?

                         ALBERT
          I don't know. It's exciting. New
          frontiers are hard to come by these
          days. I guess I just like the idea
          of discovering something.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         103
          Doing something completely unique
          that no one's ever done before.
          Large looks to Sam.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. "Albert's Abyss".

                         ALBERT
          Who knows? Maybe. But I used to
          think that was all that mattered.
          No matter what it was, as long as I
          could put my name on it. Like it
          would somehow justify the fact that
          I lived; that I was here. "I did
          that. That's mine. I got this plate
          on my travels." But you know what?
          That's all ego; none of that stuff
          really matters. If at the end of
          the day I get to be with her, if I
          get to be with this person right
          here and the baby we created, then
          that's all I need. Just having
          felt that... If I die in an hour, I
          know I've lived.
          Faye kisses his forehead.

                         LARGE
          You know "my whole life I've had
          that same anxiety that if I didn't
          discover something or... save
          something or...

                         SAM
          Save something from being
          discovered.

                         LARGE
          Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted
          my time here. And that somewhere,
          whatever force created us, would
          resent me for it.

                         ALBERT
          Well I think that force would
          rather remind you that "breathing's
          all it takes to be a miracle".
          He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert;
          TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage.

          GREAT MUSIC BEGINS.

                         ALBERT
          Well i suppose you want what you
          came all the way down here for.

                         MARX
          Yeah, that would be great.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         104

                         ALBERT
          It took me awhile to track this
          piece down. But I owe Diego huge.
          He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to
          Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.

                         MARK
          That's it. Thank you.
          They all stand.

                         SAM
          Well thank you for the tea.

                         LARGE
          Yeah, thanks.

                         FAYE
          Okay, good luck in the rain. Would
          you like some garbage bags or
          something?

                         LARGE
          Yeah, that would be great.

          EXT ALBERT'S HOUSE BOAT--DAY
          They open the door and venture into the, DOWN POUR in their
          garbage bag parkas.

                         ALBERT
          Good-bye.
          Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway.
          As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the
          path. Large turns back' around.

                         LARGE

          Good luck exploring the infinite

                         105

          THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES
          SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain
          parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half
          speed.
          Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm
          hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.
          REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with
          everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss.
          Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to
          join hint.
          The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair
          drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,
          with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.
          FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect
          moment.
          UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.
          They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and
          they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MARK'S HOUSE -- LATER

          The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front
          of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar.

                         LARGE
          So I don't know if I'm gonna see
          you.

                         MARK
          I know. Don't you wanna know what's
          in the bag?

                         LARGE
          To be honest, I don't even care
          anymore.
          Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80
          wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a
          square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.

                         MARK
          I'd be lying to ya if I told ya
          this was my plan all along.

                         (BEAT)
          But I got it back. That's got to be
          worth something, right?

                         LARGE
          This whole day was about this?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         106

                         MARK

                         (NODDING)
          And anyway you didn't want it down
          there with her. It's better for you
          to have it.
          Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still
          wearing his garbage bag parka.

                         MARK (CONT'D)
          Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you
          know where to find me.
          Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He
          stares at the pendant in his hand.

                         SAM
          What is it?

                         LARGE
          It's my Mom's favorite necklace.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM -- NIGHT

          They sit, soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where
          Sarah Largeman drowned,, cross-legged facing each other.
          Large wears the necklace around his neck. He plays with the
          pendant...
          EXTREME CLOSE-UP INSIDE TEE PENDANT: It's an antique game
          where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three
          separate indentations.

                         LARGE
          No. I don't want to play this game.

                         SAM
          Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting
          here, across from you and you can
          say anything at all. All the things
          you never got a chance to say.

                         (BEAT)
          No?

                         I (BEAT)
          Well I don't want to push you. I
          just thought it might help. I mean
          isn't that what you came home for?
          Re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath.

                         LARGE
          Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          I would...

                         (BEAT)
          If she were sitting here.

                         107
          if my mother were sitting here I
          would tell her...
          Silence. The faucet DRIPS behind him.

                         SAM
          What?

                         LARGE
          I really don't wanna...

                         (BEAT)
          I would tell her that I'm sorry.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry that she wasn't happy.
          And I'm sorry I couldn't make her
          happy. And you know if I could have
          had anything I ever wanted to have
          happen in my life actually ever
          happen, it would have been that she
          would be happy. And...
          A tiny tear wells in his lid and. spills over.

                         SAM
          Oh, my God, Large I think I see
          one.

                         LARGE
          Shut-up.

                         SAM
          Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should
          save it or something.
          She finds a clear plastic cup.

          SAM (COUT' D)
          Here don't move, I'm gonna get it.
          She tries to coerce the- tear off his cheek into the cup, like
          a child capturing an inch worm.

          I guess I could put it in my

          Is that it?

                         LARGE
          I think so. I don't feel any more
          coming.

                         SAM
          Well if you do, let me know and
          I'll grab the cup, okay?

          Yeah.

                         SAM
          This was a good idea. Keep talking.

                         LARGE
          It's funny; this thing reminds me
          of this really random memory of my
          mother. Its so weird, I haven't
          thought about this in so long, but
          this great memory I have where I
          was a little kid and I was crying
          for one reason or another and she
          was kind of holding me and rocking
          me back and forth. And I could see
          the little balls in this thing just
          rolling back and forth. And there
          was just snot dripping down my
          nose.

                         (HE LAUGHS)
          And she just handed me her sleeve
          and told me to just blow my nose
          into it. And I remember thinking,
          even as a very little kid, "Wow.
          This is love."
          More tears start to well and overflow from his eyes. He tries
          to stifle them with a LAUGH. He cradles the pendant.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          This is love. And it just felt
          so... good to be there. So safe.
          And I didn't feel safe very often,
          but at that moment...
          Tears are now streaming down his face as well as Sam's. She
          holds the plastic cup in her hand.

                         SAM
          oh, Large I'm never gonna be able
          to get all these.
          They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his
          waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          I'm never gonna be able to get all
          these, am I?

                         LARGE
          It's so funny isn't it? But I
          think that's the single most
          amazing moment I remember of my
          Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and
          she wasn't being prodded to be
          happy, she was just there.

                         SAM

          He node and tightens his lips; trying to hold in the faucet
          that his eyes have become; a monumental release. He almost
          looks like a different person. They stare directly into each
          other's eyes. He turns away; it's too vulnerable a place for
          him.

          Let go. Listen to me. Just don't

          What do you feel? Describe it. That
          always helps me. My mom always
          says, "What's the word that's
          burning in your chest..."
          She touches his chest with her hand.

                         SAM (CONT'D)
          What is it?
          He looks away. Soared.

          sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall
          down. So it's like I just...
          barrel through and don't look up,
          so I'll just never fall, you know?
          And that's really... and you know
          it's so sad to say this, but that's
          really how I've been living my
          whole life.

          She comes in for a tight embrace. He kisses her gently on her
          cheek with his eyes closed, then rests his head on her
          - shoulder.

                         SAM
          How do you feel?
          On Large's face as he thinks about that question.

                         LARGE
          Safe.

          up. And I don't want to do that .
          This matters too much to me.

          He checks his watch.

          LARGE (CONT`D)
          This isn't a conversation about
          this being over. It's about me
          needing time to... Look, I just
          fired my psychiatrist, I gotta go
          out and find a new one.
          He stares off. Decision time.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          - I gotta go. I'm gonna call you. As
          soon as I get there I'm gonna call
          you.
          She nods; heartbroken.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          Look at me.
          She doesn't.
          LARGE (CONT' t )
          Look at me.
          She turns.

                         LARGE (CONT'D)
          You've changed my life, Samantha.
          And I've known you for four days.
          This is the beginning of something
          big. But right now I gotta go.
          He kisses her on her mouth. As he pulls away she arcs her
          head to touch his lips for one more second.

          FADE TO BLACK:

          ANCHOR (O.S.)
          Well Paul is off tonight, but we're
          lucky enough to have Ryan Walker
          here to tell us about our weather.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Gideon sits on the edge of the bed cutting his toe-nails.
          He's naked except for white underwear. The SOUND OF WATER
          running in the bathroom.

          ANCHOR (O.S.)
          Ryan, how's it lookin' out there?

          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Gideon?

                         116
          Gideon doesn't hear the voice as he bends over and tries to
          pick each toenail he's cut out of the thick carpet.

          RYAN (O.S.)
          Thank you, Dan. Well I have some
          good news. We are in for some
          gorgeous weather coming our way out
          of the northwest.

                         FEMALE VOICE
          Gideon?
          A SCREAM and a BANG from the FEMALE VOICE in the other room!
          GIDEON'S FACE as it whips up into frame from his task on the
          floor.

          FEMALE VOICE (CONT'A)

          GIDEON!

          SHE SCREAMS AGAIN THROUGH WATER!
          He darts up off the floor and races to the open bathroom
          doorl He is about to enter and then he's STOPPED ABRUPTLY.

                         SARAH

                         GIDEON I
          SARAH IS DROWNING. Through the door we see SPLASHES OF WATER
          as they land on the bathroom floor.
          GIDEON'S FACE. he can't move; fro2en. His mind is racing;
          ADRENALINE. We can almost see how fast:his, mind is
          processing through his EYES.
          The WEATHER REPORT continues low in the background.

                         SARAH (CONT'D)

                         (THROUGH GASPS)

          GIDE...
          And then silence.
          GIDEON'S FACE; Wide-eyed in terror.
          HIS FINGERS as they slide down off the bathroom door frame.
          He backs away slowly to the bed and site down; staring
          blankly at the bathroom door. And then he starts to SOB.
          Quickly his whole body seems to surrender into it and he
          WEEPS hard. His whole back lurches upward with each SOH.

          RYAN (O.S.)
          So there you have it folks; get out
          the picnic baskets, push up those
          storm windows, 'cause it appears
          that Spring has arrived.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         117
          Gideon looks up; lost. His face is covered with tears. He
          reaches down to the phone and dials 911.

                         GIDEON
          I need an ambulance.

          INT. AIRPORT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA-- DAY

          Sam cries in a phone booth. A KNOCK on the glass spins her
          around to see Large. He opens the door.

                         SAM
          What are you doing?

                         LARGE
          Remember that idea I had about
          growing and working stuff out on my
          own and then finding you when I'd
          figured myself out?

                         SAM
          The ellipses?

                         LARGE
          Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's
          an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do
          it. Because like you said, this is
          it. This is life. And I'm in love
          with you, Samantha.
          (with a laugh)
          I think that's the only thing I've
          .ever been really sure of in my
          whole life. I'm really fucked up
          right now, but I don't want to
          waste any more of my life without
          you in it. Okay?

                         SAM
          Yeah.

                         LARGE
          Because I think I can do this. I
          know I can. I want to. We have to.
          Yeah?
          Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.

          Okay.
          (beat, nodding)
          What do we do?
          He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile;

          ALIVE; AWAKE; CHARGED!

          LARGE (CONT - D)
          What do we do?

          They pause for a moment, staring at each other, transfixed by
          adrenaline and spontaneity. Slowly Large leans in and they
          kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area.

               INT. TRIBECA LOFT - DAY

               The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts 
               of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie 
               netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and 
               disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.

               Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky 
               light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.

               An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips 
               of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard 
               dimly in the distance.

               With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes 
               out of nowhere. The wall shudders.

               HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. 
               The wall buckles.

               Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new 
               swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. 
               Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the 
               atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of 
               wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the 
               air. We hear voices talking.

                                     MOLLY (O.S.)
                         What a mess!

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         I told you!

               Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on 
               the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS.

                                     SAM
                         I can't breathe.

                                     MOLLY
                         Use your mask, dummy.

               One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated 
               rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in 
               the air.

                                     SAM
                              (singing)
                         "Volga boat..., man." Whoomph!

               His hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs.

               ANGLE

               The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY 
               JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and 
               a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her 
               eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his 
               late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong 
               forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his 
               brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, 
               removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a 
               fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light 
               penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see 
               a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with 
               something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, 
               a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge 
               clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, look, there's a whole eight 
                         feet up there.

                                     SAM
                         And about eighty years of dust.

                                     MOLLY
                         We have all this height, Sam. We 
                         could add a second floor and put our 
                         bedroom upstairs. That would leave 
                         all this space.

                                     SAM
                              (eyeing her curiously)
                         For what?

                                     MOLLY
                         For space. Just space.

                                     SAM
                         Be great for bumper cars.

               Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with 
               white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.

                                     CARL
                         Sam, this may be none of my business, 
                         but I'm concerned you're doing too 
                         much coke.

               Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hey, Sam, turn around.

               Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and 
               the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, 
               accomplished, and subtly erotic.

                                     CARL
                              (offering his body)
                         How 'bout me?

               Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female 
               torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches 
               it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a 
               Greek statue.

                                     CARL
                         I'll never wash again.

               Molly laughs.

               ANGLE

               Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly 
               begins to count.

                                     MOLLY
                         All together now. One,
                              (they strike the wall 
                              with their hammers. 
                              The wall shakes)
                         two,
                              (they pound again. 
                              The wall begins to 
                              give)
                         three.

               In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster 
               and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the 
               air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. 
               Something rattles inside it, a penny.

                                     SAM
                         Hey, look what I found. There's a 
                         penny inside.
                              (he hands it to Molly)
                         For luck in our new loft. It's a 
                         good omen.

                                     MOLLY
                              (shaking her head, 
                              disagreeing)
                         You're the good omen.

               She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them 
               and grins.

               As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines 
               of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over 
               four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and 
               west. Molly steps back and admires the room.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's gorgeous.

                                     CARL
                         You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you 
                         could sell it tomorrow and double 
                         your investment.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.

                                     CARL
                         What I wouldn't do for a place like 
                         this.

                                     SAM
                         It's gonna be great.

               EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits 
               and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach 
               the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move 
                         your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so 
                         you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He 
                         called yesterday and said he has to 
                         see you today about the Danway stuff. 
                         Three o'clock was the only time he 
                         could make it. Also, the board meeting 
                         in L.A. has been confirmed for the 
                         12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.

               Sam seems preoccupied.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain 
                         surgery you're going into.

                                     SAM
                         I hate pitching to these Japanese 
                         guys. They make me nervous. I mean, 
                         what am I supposed to say, "Who do 
                         you think'll win that big Sumo 
                         championship"?

                                     CARL
                         Sam, you'll be fine. You're great 
                         with people.

               Sam's jacket flares open. He is wearing yellow suspenders. 
               Carl notices.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, nice. I like those.

               Sam, not completely comfortable wearing them, buttons his 
               jacket.

                                     SAM
                         ...Molly.

               Carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa. 
                         That's the car I'm gonna drive when 
                         I'm making two hundred grand.

                                     SAM
                         Better pay off your Mustang first.

               INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, ELEVATOR - DAY

               Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator. It is deadly 
               quiet. Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks. There is something 
               he wants him to do. Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and 
               then relents. He clears his throat.

                                     SAM
                         So Carl, what did the doctor say?

                                     CARL
                         He said it was contagious. Very 
                         contagious. I shouldn't be going 
                         into work today.
                              (he coughs loudly)
                         But what could I do?

               He sneezes. People on the elevator freeze.

                                     SAM
                         And what about the rash?

                                     CARL
                         Not good. It's spreading everywhere.

                                     SAM
                         On your genitals again?

                                     CARL
                         Everywhere. He said be sure not to 
                         touch anyone.

               We see people trying to inch away. Carl coughs again. They 
               hold their breath. The elevator stops at the next floor. All 
               the passengers get off.

               INT. BANK HEADQUARTERS, EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

               Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area 
               bustling with activity. Employees, in various cubicles, are 
               talking on telephones and punching information into computers.

               Sam heads into his executive office. Carl steps into a cubicle 
               across the aisle. ROSE, Sam's secretary, approaches him.

                                     ROSE
                         Morning, Mr. Wheat.

                                     SAM
                         Morning Rose. Listen, when the 
                         Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore 
                         take them right to the...

                                     ROSE
                         They're already here.

               She points to a windowed conference room. Sam turns around 
               and sees a large group of JAPANESE MEN standing inside.

                                     SAM
                         They're early!

                                     ROSE
                         I know. And Andy Dillon called. He 
                         said they need $900,000 transferred 
                         to Albany by noon.

                                     SAM
                         Noon? Damn!

               He hurries over to Carl's cubicle. He is on the phone. Carl 
               cups the mouthpiece.

                                     CARL
                         Hold on.

                                     SAM
                         Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in 
                         Albany by noon. Can you transfer it 
                         to his payroll account?

                                     CARL
                         Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.

               Sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book. 
               He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to 
               Carl.

                                     SAM
                         Discretion, huh?

                                     CARL
                         You bet. I'll do it right away.

               INT. WELL-APPOINTED EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY

               Sam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are 
               sitting around a large granite conference table. Sam stands 
               up and speaks a simple greeting to them.

                                     SAM
                              (in Japanese)
                         Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf 
                         of Market Security Bank & Trust, I 
                         welcome you to our city.

               The men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.

                                     MEN
                         Arigato.

               They look to Sam, expecting more. Uncomfortable, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     SAM
                         I'm afraid that's the only Japanese 
                         I know. But I realize it's not our 
                         language fluency, or lack of it, 
                         that brings you to Market Security. 
                         Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking 
                         expertise, our ability to represent 
                         and anticipate all of your banking 
                         needs. As you know, we are not the 
                         largest banking establishment in New 
                         York.
                              (his throat goes dry 
                              and he takes a sip 
                              of water)
                         But, with combined assets of over 
                         200 billion dollars, we have a firm 
                         commitment to the international 
                         marketplace.

               A SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper. 
               It reads "MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT." She hands him a phone.

               Sam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests.

                                     SAM
                         Excuse me.
                              (he picks up the 
                              receiver)
                         Hello?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOLLY

               dressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters 
               studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working 
               at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside 
               Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into 
               the phone.

                                     MOLLY
                         A man and a woman are lying in bed 
                         when the woman's husband suddenly 
                         comes home. Frightened, she tells 
                         the man he has to leave instantly 
                         through the window. He has no time 
                         to dress.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               SAM

               straight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is 
               important.

                                     SAM
                         Uh hmm.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         It's raining outside. The man, running 
                         naked along the street, sees some 
                         joggers approaching.

               The entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         One of the joggers calls out. "Hey, 
                         do you always go jogging naked?" And 
                         the man says, "Yes, always."

                                     SAM
                         Okay.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         And then the other jogger says, "And 
                         do you always wear a condom?" The 
                         man looks down, embarrassed, and 
                         replies, "Only when it's raining."

               Sam squelches a smile.

                                     SAM
                         Well, that's just fine.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         Now just relax and have fun, okay? 
                         It's not the end of the world if you 
                         lose this account. You've always got 
                         me.

                                     SAM
                         Thank you. I'll remember that.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         See ya.

               He hangs up and stares at the Japanese men. A short smile 
               crosses his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A CARVED WOODEN ANGEL

               eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and 
               that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above 
               the street.

               A group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty 
               bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME.

                                     MOLLY
                         Where you guys from, the New York 
                         City Ballet?

               With a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and 
               tries to grab hold of the ropes. She can't reach them. 
               Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. She 
               screams.

                                     SAM
                         Saved your life.

               Sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. She does not 
               think it is funny.

                                     MOLLY
                         You bastard. Don't do that to me. 
                         You scared me half to death.

                                     SAM
                         Better than seeing this gorgeous 
                         body splattered all over the street. 
                         Here, look out.

               Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings 
               out over the sidewalk. Molly gasps. Sam's feet push at the 
               angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the 
               loft. Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it 
               in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration.

               Suddenly we hear a voice call out.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Sam? Molly? Anybody home?

               Molly looks to Sam.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl? Did you invite him?

                                     SAM
                              (under his breath)
                         I couldn't keep him away.

               Carl enters, shakes Molly's hand, and pats Sam on the back.

                                     CARL
                         Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?

               Before they can answer, a WORKMAN turns to Molly.

                                     WORKMAN (V.O.)
                         Where do you want this?

                                     MOLLY
                         In the bedroom.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly 
               decorated loft for the first time. It is painted now in lovely 
               pastels. The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is 
               lacquered with polyurethane. Furniture and boxes are piling 
               up along the walls. Dominating the space, with a kind of 
               surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures 
               and ceramics. There is also a vintage jukebox. Carl is 
               impressed.

                                     CARL
                         Wow! The place looks great. Really 
                         great.

                                     MOLLY
                         You like it, huh?

                                     CARL
                         "Like" is hardly the word. I never 
                         imagined it would be this beautiful. 
                         This is incredible.

               A mover lugs in a heavy old chair. Molly sees it.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, you kept that chair?

                                     SAM
                         What do you mean? It's comfortable. 
                         For T.V. I love that chair.

                                     MOLLY
                         But it doesn't go with anything.

                                     SAM
                         It goes with me.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's okay, I'll paint it.

               Sam pinches her ass. Molly smiles.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

               Sam, Molly, and Carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating 
               from Cartons of Chinese food. Frank, a gray cat, eats beside 
               them. Unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.

                                     SAM
                         It was the middle of December. I was 
                         sitting in my old office, the one 
                         Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this 
                         woman screaming. I thought someone'd 
                         been shot or something.

                                     MOLLY
                         They took away my MasterCard. It was 
                         Christmas, for godssake.

                                     SAM
                         She was four thousand dollars over 
                         her limit.

                                     MOLLY
                         It wasn't four thousand. And I'd 
                         already sent in the payment! You're 
                         the ones that lost it.

                                     SAM
                         She's still angry.

                                     MOLLY
                         No I'm not.

               The cat begins nibbling Sam's food.

                                     SAM
                         Get outta here, Frank!
                              (the cat scampers 
                              away)
                         You should have seen her. All pink 
                         and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, 
                         like a rose. And she's screaming, 
                         demanding to see the president. So 
                         Wilton brought her to me.

                                     CARL
                         You? You weren't even a VP yet.

                                     SAM
                         She didn't know that.

               Carl smiles.

                                     MOLLY
                         Can you believe it? And the next 
                         thing I know, he's telling me his 
                         life story. I couldn't believe it. 
                         Everything. About his divorce, how 
                         he'd just arrived in New York, how 
                         he didn't know any women. And all 
                         with this Montana accent.

                                     SAM
                         What's a Montana accent?

                                     MOLLY
                         The one you always slip into it when 
                         you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank 
                         you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts, 
                         Ma'am?"

                                     SAM
                              (laughing)
                         I wasn't nervous.

                                     MOLLY
                         Admit it. You liked me. You were 
                         interested.

                                     SAM
                              (matter of factly)
                         I thought you were cute.

                                     MOLLY
                         Cute?
                              (looking at Carl)
                         Do you believe this? I should have 
                         been Picasso's mistress. I should 
                         have been living in Barcelona or 
                         Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a 
                         New York banker who thinks I'm cute.

               She looks at Sam and grins. Carl is staring at Molly, 
               obviously turned on by her. He is embarrassed when she catches 
               his gaze and quickly looks away.

               OMITTED

               INT. MOLLY'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Molly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is sitting at her potters 
               wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters the studio. He 
               is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans.

                                     SAM
                         What are you doing?

                                     MOLLY
                         I felt inspired.

                                     SAM
                         At 2:00 am?

               She nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in 
               front of her. Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, 
               molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured, 
               gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly, 
               almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins 
               kissing them.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         You notice Carl's eyes today? They 
                         were all over you.

                                     MOLLY
                         What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me 
                         tell you something. He's not even 
                         looking at me. It's you he idolizes. 
                         He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, 
                         he's not my type.

               Sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay. 
               Molly looks up at him.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         What are you doing?

                                     SAM
                         I feel inspired.

               His hands dig into the clay. Molly smiles. Their fingers 
               seem to dance together. After a moment, she reaches up to 
               him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving 
               down to his chest. Sam grins and reaches down to her.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SAM'S FINGER

               as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. We watch as the 
               mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers 
               it to the turntable. The arm hovers over the record and then 
               descends. It begins to play. The song is "Unchained Melody" 
               by the Righteous Brothers.

               SAM AND MOLLY

               are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. Moonlight pours 
               through the windows and shines off the floor. Wads of packing 
               paper swirl sensuously around their feet.

               Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is 
               sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers 
               down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her 
               eyes, her lips.

               Sam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving 
               them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance 
               silently, her hair swaying in the soft light.

               We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished 
               floor.

               Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses 
               into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She 
               bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his 
               chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the 
               curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his 
               jeans.

               Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing. 
               Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands 
               move to her backside. He pulls her closer.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               SAM AND MOLLY, making love on the livingroom carpet. Paper 
               and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across 
               the floor. For all their sensuality, it is their hands and 
               eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that 
               is deeply moving. Their lovemaking is full of love.

               JUKEBOX

               The song ends. The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides 
               the record back into its slot.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               OMITTED

               BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sam and Molly are lying together silently. Molly gazes at 
               him.

                                     MOLLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     SAM
                         The matter?

                                     MOLLY
                         I can tell.

                                     SAM
                         Nothing... really.

                                     MOLLY
                         You're worried, aren't you? About 
                         moving in together?

                                     SAM
                         No. Not really.

                                     MOLLY
                         Then what? The promotion?

                                     SAM
                         I don't know. A lot of things. I 
                         just don't want the bubble to burst... 
                         Whenever something good happens to 
                         me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose 
                         it.

               Molly gently strokes his head.

                                     MOLLY
                         You know what?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     MOLLY
                         I love you. I really love you.

               He smiles and strokes her cheek.

                                     SAM
                         Ditto.

               Suddenly the T.V. blares into the room. Sam jumps up, grabbing 
               the remote control unit from under his buttocks. Molly laughs 
               as he turns the SOUND DOWN. The news is on and they are 
               showing the remains of an airline disaster. Sam stares at 
               the tube.

                                     SAM
                         Oh Jesus. Another one.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't watch that stuff.

               He motions to wait. Dead bodies litter the screen.

                                     CORRESPONDENT
                         ...It is estimated that 34 people 
                         died in the crash, the second in 
                         less than two weeks.

               The T.V. goes OFF. Sam, confused, spins around. Molly is 
               holding the remote control. She nods for him to lie down.

                                     SAM
                         I should cancel my L.A. trip... These 
                         things always happen in threes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides, 
                         you lead a charmed life.

                                     SAM
                         Yeah. So did they.

               Sam looks at her and then back at the screen.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Amazing, huh?
                              (he snaps his fingers)
                         Just like that. Blackout.

               EXT. WALL STREET ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               OMITTED

               INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sam is sitting at his computer. His address book with his 
               access codes is sitting open beside him. He seems perplexed 
               by something happening on the screen. After pushing a series 
               of buttons and getting the same response, he whacks the 
               computer on the side. Carl, walking in the door, sees him. 
               Sam looks up sheepishly.

                                     SAM
                         A glitch. What's up?

                                     CARL
                         The Mark Greenberg and Larry White 
                         accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC 
                         code doesn't work.

                                     SAM
                         I changed it.

                                     CARL
                         Why? What's up?

                                     SAM
                         Nothing. I just want to nose around 
                         a bit... Can you keep your mouth 
                         shut?

                                     CARL
                         Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going 
                         on.

                                     SAM
                         I think I've stumbled onto something. 
                         There's too much money in these 
                         accounts.

                                     CARL
                         Too much money. That's ridiculous. 
                         How could there be too much money?

                                     SAM
                         That's what I keep asking myself.

                                     CARL
                         It must be the computer.

                                     SAM
                         I've been checking.

                                     CARL
                         Yeah, Mr. Fixit.
                              (he hits the computer 
                              like Sam did and 
                              laughs)
                         Come on, move over. Let me see what 
                         I can do.

                                     SAM
                         Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit.

                                     CARL
                         Okay, okay. Just call me when you're 
                         ready for help.
                              (he heads for the 
                              door)
                         So, what are you and Moll doing 
                         tonight?

                                     SAM
                         We're going to the theatre. She wants 
                         to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street 
                         Repertory.

               Carl winces. Sam smiles.

               INT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT

               Sam and Molly are sitting in the fifth row of a crowded 
               auditorium. He is sound asleep.

               ANGLE STAGE

               A scene from "Macbeth".

               Sam begins to snore. Molly grabs his nose. He jerks awake. 
               Molly grins.

               EXT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT

               Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit 
               the theatre. It is a beautiful brisk night.

                                     SAM
                         I loved it.

                                     MOLLY
                         I could tell.

               She smiles and squeezes his arm. They walk silently down a 
               dark street, heading toward their loft. The pavement is full 
               of shadows.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Did I tell you what Marcia said?

                                     SAM
                         Six times.

                                     MOLLY
                         Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so 
                         blasé. I'll have two major pieces in 
                         the show. The New York Times reviews 
                         her gallery all the time. This could 
                         be huge.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, the "New York Times" is some 
                         frustrated little critic with pimples 
                         on his ass who flunked out of art 
                         school. Who cares what The New York 
                         Times thinks?

                                     MOLLY
                         Eight million readers, that's who.

                                     SAM
                         Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, 
                         Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone 
                         thinks.

               We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does. 
               Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then, 
               suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected 
               seriousness in her voice.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I want to marry you, Sam.

                                     SAM
                              (taken aback)
                         What?

                                     MOLLY
                         I've been thinking about it for days. 
                         More than thinking. I want to do it. 
                         I want to jump in whole hog...
                              (she pauses)
                         What is that look for?

                                     SAM
                              (staring at her)
                         It's just been so long since... I 
                         mean, you never wanted to talk about 
                         it.

               There is a long pause.

                                     MOLLY
                         Do you love me, Sam?

                                     SAM
                         What do you think, Moll?

                                     MOLLY
                         How come you never say it?

                                     SAM
                         What are you talking about?

                                     MOLLY
                         You say "ditto". It's not the same.

                                     SAM
                         People say "I love you" all the time. 
                         It doesn't mean anything.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sometimes you need to hear it.

               Sam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about 
               to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind 
               him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around.

               AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN

               is standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares 
               at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk. 
               Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then 
               begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath.

               Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the 
               street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them.

                                     MOLLY
                         What should we do?

                                     SAM
                         Let me handle this.

               Sam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in 
               the face. Molly screams.

                                     WILLIE
                         Your wallet!

               Sam waits a beat.

                                     MOLLY
                         Give it to him!

               Sam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and 
               then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.

                                     SAM
                         Take the money. Just leave the wallet 
                         and my...

               He swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger 
               whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the 
               mugger with all his might.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam, No!

               There is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man. 
               Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off 
               running. Sam charges after him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam!!!!!

               The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is 
               already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.

               Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward 
               Molly.

               We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam 
               approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls 
               out.

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               She doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward 
               her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An 
               expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSEUP - MOLLY

               drenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock. 
               Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS 
               WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows 
               and pulls it toward her.

               It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.

               Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands 
               beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He 
               seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the 
               full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.

               Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.

                                     SAM
                         No!!!!!!

               He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold 
               of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as 
               they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up, 
               crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though 
               he is trying to undo what has been done.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         This isn't happening. It's not 
                         happening.

               He reaches out to Molly for help. His hand cuts through her 
               shoulder. He screams.

               FOOTSTEPS. People are running down the street. The sound of 
               SIRENS can be heard in the distance. Two MEN run toward Sam. 
               He yells out at them.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Help me!

               They run right through him. He gasps in stunned terror.

               Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks 
               up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs 
               her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of 
               life.

               The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and 
               begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is 
               no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It 
               is a futile gesture.

                                     SAM
                         Do it! Do it!

               The Man bangs on Sam's chest. Blood gushes from the wound. 
               Molly recoils. He bangs again.

                                                           CUT ABRUPTLY TO:

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Sam shoots up in bed, panting. It is dark. He stares around 
               the loft in sudden confusion. With a lurch he flicks on the 
               night light. Molly is lying beside him, her head buried 
               beneath a pillow. Sam seems stunned.

                                     SAM
                         Molly? Molly!

               Tears stream down his face. Molly stirs.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam? What's the matter? Is something 
                         wrong?

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               Sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly 
               breathe.

                                     MOLLY
                         What is it, honey?

               Molly, groggy, tries to sit up. Sam reaches out for her.

               As she turns around, we see A SKELETEL VERSION OF HER HEAD 
               staring at the camera. It speaks.

                                     MOLLY
                              (mocking him)
                         What is it, honey?

               Sam bolts upright, screaming. It is a scream so consumed by 
               terror that one fears it will never stop.

                                                       CUT UNEXPECTEDLY TO:

               CLOSE-UP OF SAM

               asleep in bed. He is thrashing at his pillow and moaning.

               Suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder. Sam 
               jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               Molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid.

               Sam stares down at her. He is breathing heavily, not trusting 
               his own senses. His hands clutch at the wall.

                                     SAM
                         What's happening to me?!

               ANGLE

               Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a 
               host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, 
               float before us. A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite 
               vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that 
               the light is enchanting him. The entire room begins to 
               disappear in the light.

               Molly screams.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.

               ANGLE

               Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed. She is 
               back on the street. To his amazement, he is on the street, 
               too, still bathed in the soothing light. Frightened, he calls 
               out to her.

                                     SAM
                         Molly!

               She does not hear him. He calls again.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Molly.

               There is no response. Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a 
               moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a 
               painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and 
               walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him 
               disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There 
               is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates 
               into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement. He stands 
               there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward 
               Molly. An AMBULANCE is rounding the corner.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

               Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights 
               and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN 
               wails into the night.

               INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

               Sam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a 
               PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort 
               to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can 
               tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless. 
               Sam yells.

                                     SAM
                         Don't stop! I'm not dead!

               Molly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry 
               in long terrible sobs.

               INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               A DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the 
               emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of 
               swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO 
               POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her.

               Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but 
               then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back 
               just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled 
               into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems 
               stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it.

               A wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench. 
               He begins talking.

                                     MAN
                         So, what happened to you?

               Sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him.

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     MAN
                         You're new, huh? I can tell.

                                     SAM
                         Are you talking to me?

                                     MAN
                         Relax. It ain't like before, you 
                         know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you?

                                     MAN
                         I'm waiting for my wife. She's in 
                         4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.

               The man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's 
               body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified.

                                     MAN
                              (continuing)
                         Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. 
                         Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. 
                         You could be here a long time.
                              (leaning in close)
                         I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't 
                         as bad as you think. Zip zap. They 
                         ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. 
                         You'll catch on.

               Suddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several 
               PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the 
               table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and 
               they seem to be failing.

                                     MAN
                              (continuing)
                         He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it 
                         a million times. He's a goner. See? 
                         Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could 
                         have been the other ones. You never 
                         know.

               ANGLE

               Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room 
               fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks 
               up and freezes.

               The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating 
               down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the 
               operating table. They are emitting a powerful light.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Hurry, we're losing him.

                                     MAN
                         What'd I tell you? Bingo!

               The glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help 
               extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly 
               from a solid object into an ethereal substance.

               Sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit 
               upward. They evaporate through the ceiling.

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's gone.

               ANGLE

               The light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the 
               dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam 
               turns to the Old Man.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you? What's happening...?

               The Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with 
               Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam 
               jumps in front of him.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         No!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The 
               penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He 
               stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly 
               intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary 
               strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the 
               Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of 
               ultimate chaos, the universe within.

               Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is 
               still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling.

                                     SAM
                         Oh God, help me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. 
               The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes 
               a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.

               The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S 
               P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets 
               of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed. 
               Time seems unfixed, malleable.

               We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.

                                     MINISTER
                         As we say farewell to our friend Sam 
                         Wheat, we are reminded of his 
                         kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy 
                         of spirit...

               The CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are 
               among the mourners.

                                     MINISTER
                              (continuing)
                         All that we treasure, our friends, 
                         our loved ones, our body, our mind, 
                         are but on loan to us. We must 
                         surrender them all. We are all 
                         travelers on the same road which 
                         leads to the same end.

               Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of 
               the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. 
               Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.

               As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears 
               just like any normal person until she approaches a large 
               gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.

                                     MINISTER
                         As our loved one enters eternal life, 
                         let us remember that love, too, is 
                         eternal, that although we will miss 
                         him, our love will light the void 
                         and dispel the darkness.

               Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA 
               STOPS.

                                     SAM
                         Molly.

               She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her. 
               Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a 
               tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand. 
               He squeezes it with affection.

                                     MINISTER
                         ...and into Your hands we commend 
                         his spirit. May he rest in peace. In 
                         the name of the Father, the Son, and 
                         the Holy Ghost. Amen.

               The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the 
               grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A 
               shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort 
               she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. 
               It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               LONG SHOT - PEOPLE

               leaving the cemetery. We hear them talking.

                                     VOICES
                         What time you going back to work?... 
                         What's the buzz on Digital? It's 
                         sad. He was so young... How's your 
                         new Honda?... Going away this weekend?

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               CLOSEUP - SAM

               desperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back 
               into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine. 
               He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then, 
               after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body, 
               from his own grave site, he runs after her.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft 
               surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her 
               niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling 
               around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam, 
               standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity 
               he is lost and alone.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               ANGLE

               Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. 
               Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl 
               begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He 
               is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his 
               chest, rocking aimlessly.

               Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts 
               and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl 
               disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes.

               Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly 
               around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to 
               the air.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh God, Sam...

               Sam looks up.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I picked up your shirts this morning. 
                         I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said 
                         to tell you hello. I broke into tears. 
                         It's so hard...

               Sam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches 
               out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         I think about you every minute. It's 
                         like you're still here, like I can 
                         feel you, Sam.

               He stares at her, hoping, wondering.

                                     SAM
                         I am here, Moll. I am.

               ANGLE

               Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. 
               Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, 
               Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the 
               cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. 
               Molly stands up.

                                     MOLLY
                         Frank, what's wrong? Frank?

               The cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes. 
               Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she 
               senses his presence.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing; whispering)
                         Sam?

               She holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly, 
               loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches 
               out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy, 
               Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains 
               IN THE FRAME, alone.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching 
               as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot, 
               are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches 
               for a shirt.

                                     SAM
                         Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my 
                         favorite...

               She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It 
               is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. Sam 
               recognizes it.

               Molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek. 
               After a moment she puts it back. Then, in a surprising 
               outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. 
               Everything comes flying off. Sam reaches out to console her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Molly, don't.

               Unexpectedly, Carl comes rushing into the room. He takes 
               hold of Molly and sits her on the bed.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Say something. Help her, Carl.

                                     CARL
                         It's hard. It's very hard.

                                     SAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Oh good. That's really good.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding 
               piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly 
               lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side 
               pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares 
               at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops 
               to pick it up but Molly gets it first.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam's address book.

               She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes 
               are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box 
               labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" and continues packing. 
               She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked "For 
               Luck". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it 
               on the nightstand beside the bed.

               Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's 
               jackets. He examines them.

                                     CARL
                         Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I 
                         toss 'em?

                                     MOLLY
                         No!

                                     SAM
                         Molly, we hated that concert.

               She takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box. Sam 
               groans.

               Carl finds a half used package of Rolaids. Molly takes them 
               from his hand and puts them in the box, too.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, you want to save those?

                                     SAM
                         Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll?

               Molly just stares for a moment.

                                     MOLLY
                         I miss him, Carl.

               Carl comes over and takes her hand.

                                     CARL
                         We all do.

               Molly buries her head on his shoulder. Carl strokes her hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               Carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door. 
               Suddenly Molly yells out.

                                     MOLLY
                         Wait. Wait. Not that one.

               She hurries over and pulls the "Valuable" box from the stack 
               in his arms. He looks at it with surprise.

                                     CARL
                         Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know 
                         how that got in there.

               He turns to the door and then back to Molly.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's 
                         like summer outside.

                                     MOLLY
                         No.

                                     CARL
                         Just for a stroll. It'd be good to 
                         get out.

               Molly shakes her head and turns away.

                                     MOLLY
                         I can't do it Carl.

               Carl, annoyed, walks over to her.

                                     CARL
                         Molly... you're not the one who died!

               Molly stops and looks at him. He has struck home. After a 
               moment she nods her head.

                                     MOLLY
                         Okay. Just a short walk.

               He gently squeezes her shoulders.

                                     CARL
                         Thata girl.

               Before Sam even understands what is happening, they are 
               exiting the loft. Sam jumps up and runs after them.

                                     SAM
                         Hey, Molly! Wait!

               ANGLE

               The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and 
               desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through 
               it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it 
               penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back.

               Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the 
               door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand 
               pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle 
               resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his 
               ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his 
               entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND 
               shudders up his spine.

               The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does 
               not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into 
               the molecules of the wood.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed. 
               There is a sense of a universe in total chaos. Terrifying 
               SOUNDS charge through his body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM

               pulling back from the door. He is trembling.

               INT. LOFT - AN HOUR LATER

               THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY THROUGH THE LOFT AND GRADUALLY 
               DISCOVERS SAM. He is sitting in a corner singing quietly to 
               himself.

                                     SAM
                         "Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. 
                         Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the 
                         levy was dry. Them good ol' boys 
                         were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and 
                         singing this'll be the day that I..."

               He stops, realizing the last word of the song. He sits 
               silently, staring at the wall.

               Suddenly, there is a SOUND at the door. Sam's eyes shoot up. 
               The door begins to open.

               Sam stands up. His face begins to tighten. We know instantly 
               that something is wrong. His eyes fill with a fury we have 
               not seen before.

               The Mugger, the man who killed Sam, is entering the loft. He 
               has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket. Sam is 
               stunned. The Mugger locks the door.

               ANGLE

               Sam goes wild. He shoots at the man with all his might, 
               attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. His hands and 
               feet pass right through him.

                                     SAM
                         You motherfucking bastard! What the 
                         hell are you doing here? What are 
                         you doing?

               The Mugger, unaware that anything is going on, glances around 
               nervously as he moves through the vast space.

               ANGLE

               Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and 
               quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to 
               leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for 
               something but cannot find it.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Suddenly we hear a KEY TURNING in the front door. The Mugger 
               seems startled. He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly 
               behind one of the large sculptures. We hear the door OPEN. 
               Molly is standing there.

               Sam goes crazy.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, no! Get out!

               Molly closes the door and locks it shut. Sam freezes as she 
               heads for the bedroom. She walks right past the Mugger. To 
               Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. There is a 
               curious expression on her face. Seeing nothing she continues 
               through the loft.

               The Mugger pulls out his gun. Sam looks on in absolute terror.

               Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove 
               her clothes. She turns on the radio.

               Sam doesn't know what to do. The Mugger seems excited by 
               Molly's semi-nudity. He begins skirting the edges of the 
               loft, moving toward the bedroom. Sam is crazed.

               Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet. 
               Sam's eyes light up. He drops to his knees, crawls over to 
               him, glares into his eyes, and screams.

               ANGLE - THE CAT

               SCREECHES and jumps straight up. His claws shoot out at the 
               mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye.

               Blood appears. The mugger sees it dripping through his 
               fingers. The sight of it upsets him. He grabs the cat angrily 
               by the neck. It SQUEALS. Molly in her bra, peers from the 
               bedroom.

                                     MOLLY
                         Frank, what's wrong?

               The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. Seeing and hearing 
               nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom.

               The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor. 
               Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. Sam 
               runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through. 
               He is left inside.

               ANGLE - SAM

               stares at the closed door in a wild panic. He doesn't know 
               what to do. Then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a 
               blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it.

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               There is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force 
               field, a miniature universe inside the door.

               ANGLE - SAM

               as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side. He 
               seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with 
               himself.

               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

               The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward 
               the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his 
               eye.

               Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of 
               people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is 
               frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at 
               him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their 
               arms cutting through his ghostly form.

               Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people 
               approach him from all angles.

               We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly 
               falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let 
               go.

               A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than 
               he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close 
               to the Mugger.

               EXT. NEW YORK SUBWAY STATION - DAY

               The Mugger heads down a flight of steps into the IRT.

               INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

               The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a 
               corner of the train watching him.

               Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One 
               of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward 
               him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes 
               right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is 
               happening, but then it is too late.

               ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST

               With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack 
               is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how 
               to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs 
               hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head 
               plows right through it.

               ANGLE

               on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel 
               rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The 
               look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling 
               down on him.

               ANGLE

               on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost 
               as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, 
               Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the 
               Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching.

               Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds 
               himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway 
               Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane 
               look.

                                     GHOST
                         Stay off! This is mine!

               ANGLE FAVORING WINDOW

               With shocking impact, the Ghost's fist goes flying into the 
               window. To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS. 
               The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover. 
               Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion. 
               Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel 
               into broad daylight.

               EXT. ELEVATED SUBWAY STATION - DAY

               The train stops at an elevated subway platform in Brooklyn.

               OMITTED

               SAM'S P.O.V.

               Sam sees the Mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes 
               after him.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the 
               street.

               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY

               The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are 
               lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded 
               up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of 
               heavy machinery onto the pavement.

               Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and 
               notices a sign, "SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, 
               ADVISOR." He looks up to a third story window and sees a 
               similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on 
               the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the 
               Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes 
               after him.

               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY

               Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 
               Prospect Place.

               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

               Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he 
               opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it 
               is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail.

               INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled 
               paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.

               Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops 
               in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's 
               license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. 
               Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, 
               knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window 
               and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. 
               Nothing happens.

                                     SAM
                         Damn!

               Willie dials the phone. Someone comes on the line.

                                     WILLIE
                         She came home. I couldn't get it. 
                         Give me a couple of days. I'll go 
                         back.

               He hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion.

                                     SAM
                         Get what? Who the hell are you? What 
                         were you doing at Molly's? What the 
                         hell's going on?

               Willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies 
               down. After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo 
               from the drawer. He studies it slowly.

               Sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage. There 
               is nothing he can do.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Stay away from her!

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected, 
               utterly aimless. He is seething inside.

               Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the 
               street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside 
               her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to 
               the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it. 
               Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam, 
               unsettled, rushes away.

               As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out 
               of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph 
               needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A 
               woman's voice booms out:

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Sorry 'bout that.

               PANNING SHOT

               to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC 
               blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.

               Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church 
               with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, 
               ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. "Contact 
               the dearly departed. $20.00".

               Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is 
               compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open 
               door.

               INT. STOREFRONT - DAY

               A record player is sitting near the storefront window, a 
               makeshift microphone placed in front of it.

               Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with 
               nothing on it. A number of people are sitting there, mostly 
               women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a 
               waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on 
               the platform and calls out:

                                     WOMAN
                         Rosa Santiago.

               MRS. SANTIAGO tucks a Spanish paperback romance into her 
               purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall. Sam follows 
               after her.

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - DAY

               Mrs. Santiago enters a dark room with a window and door 
               leading to a side street. A paisley bedspread is tacked over 
               the window.

               In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two 
               heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing 
               beside an open closet. It is empty.

                                     WOMAN
                         Please be seated.

               Mrs. Santiago sits at the table. She seems apprehensive. 
               Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as 
               though demonstrating that they are solid.

                                     CLARA
                         My sister will be with us soon.

               She steps back out and closes the door. Louise inserts a 
               tape into a boom box and then steps forward.

                                     LOUISE
                         Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of 
                         your all-seeing presence. Appear for 
                         us now.

               ANGLE FAVORING CLOSET

               She turns back to the closet and opens the door. Like magic, 
               ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black 
               woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes 
               it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is 
               wide-eyed. Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Mrs. Santiago.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Buenos dias.

               She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it 
               to Oda Mae. Clara graciously intercepts the money.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I understand you are hoping to contact 
                         your husband.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Si. Si.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Well, I believe he's gonna be with 
                         us today.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Oh, tsank you, tsank you.

               Tears well up in her eyes. She crosses herself several times.

                                     ODA MAE
                         But there's no telling about the 
                         other world. You gotta cast out all 
                         doubt. You gotta believe. Do you 
                         believe?

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (nodding her head 
                              vigorously)
                         Si. Si. I believe. I believe.

                                     ODA MAE
                         And remember, we don't make no 
                         promises. I can phone up there till 
                         I'm blue in the face,
                              (she points to the 
                              ceiling)
                         ...but it don't necessarily mean 
                         he's gonna be home. Them folks go 
                         shopping, they play bingo. It's just 
                         like here. You can't always get 'em.

               Mrs. Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.

                                     SAM
                         Sure lady!

               Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though 
               she heard something, and then she continues.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay, let's get ready then.

               Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves 
               behind Oda Mae. The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. Oda 
               Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. There 
               is a hush in the room. Her body begins to tremble. Mrs. 
               Santiago clutches her chair. Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of 
               her trance.

                                     ODA MAE
                         We got a problem here. I don't think 
                         he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did 
                         he know someone who's passed over, 
                         someone named Anna... Mary... 
                         Consuela... Maria?

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.

                                     SAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Oh my God...

               Oda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. 
                         Now I got two souls I gotta contact. 
                         I don't know about that. It's 
                         difficult, you know. The pain. The 
                         effort.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         I pay more. How much? How much?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Twenty dollars.

                                     SAM
                         Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

               Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back 
               at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither 
               can Oda Mae.

               Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill 
               changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits 
               down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up 
               into their sockets.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                         Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

               Oda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her 
               shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly 
               her whole body stiffens.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                              (continuing)
                         Have mercy! Have mercy!

               Mrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda 
               Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising 
               from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes 
               a normal pose.

               After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to 
               speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds 
               deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on 
               theatricality, it is strangely convincing.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are 
                         fortunate today. The channel is clear. 
                         Many spirits are gathering.

                                     SAM
                              (scanning the room)
                         Yeah? Where?

               Oda Mae jerks. Her eyes dart nervously around the room.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         My husband?

                                     ODA MAE
                              (a bit uneasy)
                         I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, 
                         he is drawing toward us now. I can 
                         see him coming.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he 
                         look?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, he is a very handsome man.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (surprised)
                         Handsome?

                                     ODA MAE
                         In our Father's Kingdom we are all 
                         handsome.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                              (understanding)
                         Julio!

               Sam looks on dismayed.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He is standing before me. He is 
                         wearing a black suit.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was 
                         buried in that.

               Mrs. Santiago begins to cry. Sam looks around the room with 
               growing disgust. Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells 
               into her ear.

                                     SAM
                         What a crock of shit!

               Oda Mae nearly falls off her chair. She spins around.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Who's there?

               Sam is stunned. Clara and Louise look at one another in total 
               confusion. This is obviously not part of the act. Mrs. 
               Santiago seems frightened.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Where are you?

                                     SAM
                              (looking around)
                         Who?

               Oda Mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air. Her knee 
               kicks the table and sends it toppling. Mrs. Santiago is 
               terrified.

                                     MRS. SANTIAGO
                         Julio! Julio!

                                     SAM
                         What's going on?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Get out of here! Leave me alone!

               Mrs. Santiago doesn't know what to do. She begins to cry.

                                     SAM
                         Who are you talking to?

               Clara runs up to Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Keep him away!

               Louise looks at the empty room.

                                     SAM
                         Are you talking to me?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Do something. Help me.

               Clara just stares at her sister. Sam is excited and amazed.

                                     SAM
                         I don't believe this. Hey you. My 
                         name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me? 
                         Sam Wheat!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Stop it!

                                     SAM
                         Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!

                                     CLARA
                         Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam Wheat!

               Sam nearly falls on his face. Clara's eyes widen. She is 
               more confused than ever.

                                     SAM
                         Jesus!

                                     CLARA
                         Samweet?

               Oda Mae runs into the closet.

               It has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left 
               side and she barricades herself inside it. Clara and Louise 
               stand outside pulling on the handle. They seem frightened.

                                     CLARA/LOUISE
                         Oda Mae! Oda Mae!

               INT. CLOSET - DAY

               Oda Mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying. Sam's 
               feet enter the frame beside her.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I 
                         promise, Lord. I don't want to go to 
                         hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a 
                         penance. Just make him go away.

                                     SAM
                         Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right 
                         here!

               Oda Mae screams, jumps back into the closet, and bolts up 
               against the door. It tears from its hinges and falls into 
               the seance room, nearly crushing Louise. Mrs. Santiago runs 
               out screaming. Oda Mae takes one look around and collapses 
               in a dead faint.

               OMITTED

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - DAY

               Beads of sweat collect on Oda Mae's brow and cheeks. She 
               seems feverish. Clara and Louise are sitting beside her with 
               damp towels nervously soaking up the perspiration. Oda Mae 
               appears to be talking to herself until we PULL BACK and reveal 
               Sam nearby.

                                     ODA MAE
                         My mama, her mama, may they rest in 
                         peace, they had de gift. Mama always 
                         said I had it, but I never did. She 
                         tol' me all about it, how it felt 
                         an' all. But now that it's happenin' 
                         I don't know what to do. You're 
                         scarin' me half to death. Please, 
                         you gotta go away, you gotta find 
                         someone else.

               Clara and Louise look at one another with growing concern.

                                     SAM
                         Someone else? Are you outta your 
                         mind?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm gettin' there fast.
                              (she pushes Louise's 
                              hand)
                         Leave me alone.

                                     SAM
                         Not till you help me.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Where are you?

                                     LOUISE
                         Where? I'm right here.

                                     SAM
                         I'm standing right beside you.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (mimicking his words)
                         "I'm standing right beside you."
                              (she pauses and looks 
                              up)
                         Are you white?

                                     SAM
                         What?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why 
                         me?

               Louise looks at her sister and shakes her head.

                                     SAM
                         Listen, damn it. You can help me. 
                         There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's 
                         in terrible danger. The man who killed 
                         me broke into our apartment. He's 
                         going to go back. You've gotta warn 
                         her.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Why would she listen to me?

                                     SAM
                         She has to! This man's a killer! 
                         He's got a key.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it, mister. I can't.

                                     SAM
                         It's just a phone call. You're all 
                         I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin' 
                         till you help me. I don't sleep 
                         anymore, so I can sit here day and 
                         night. I don't care how long it takes. 
                         I can talk forever.

               Oda Mae gulps, a horrified expression on her face.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               The telephone rings. Molly, preparing dinner, runs to answer 
               it.

                                     MOLLY
                         Hello.

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         Molly? Is this Molly speaking?

                                     MOLLY
                         Yes.

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual 
                         reader and adviser.
                              (she hesitates)
                         I'm calling for a friend of yours. 
                         He asked me to call. This is 
                         important. You gotta believe me. 
                         Don't be afraid.

                                     MOLLY
                         Who is this?

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         I got a message from Sam.

                                     MOLLY
                              (stunned)
                         What?

                                     ODA MAE (V.O.)
                         Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.

               Molly slams down the receiver, panting. For several seconds 
               she doesn't move. Slowly, she walks to the couch and sits 
               down. She is trembling.

               INT. ODA MAE'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Oda Mae hangs up the phone.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What'd I tell you.

                                     SAM
                         You gotta go there.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Look, I don't care what you do to 
                         me, I'm not goin' nowhere.

               INT. ODA MAE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sam is sitting on the edge of Oda Mae's bed, singing. It 
               sounds like he's been singing for hours. He is very hoarse.

                                     SAM
                         "I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery 
                         the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin' 
                         married to the widow next door / 
                         She's been married seven times before 
                         / And every one was an Henery / 
                         Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / 
                         I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery / 
                         Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery 
                         the Eighth I am / Second verse same 
                         as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth 
                         I am..."

               Oda Mae bolts upright in her bed, her hands over her ears.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut 
                         your mouth.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY BUS - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               INT. BUS - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae are sitting at the rear of a crowded bus. 
               She appears to be talking to herself.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I can't believe I'm doin' this. I 
                         gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the 
                         city with you. I never go there. 
                         What the hell you doin' in my life, 
                         huh? Why me?

               Several people move away.

               OMITTED

               EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY

               Oda Mae approaches the loft building and buzzes Molly's 
               apartment. She waits a few moments.

                                     ODA MAE
                         There's nobody there.

                                     SAM
                         Just wait.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No, sir. I did what I promised. I 
                         said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't 
                         say anything 'bout waitin'.

                                     SAM
                         Just one more time. Please. It's a 
                         big place.

               Oda Mae turns to leave. Sam, desperate, starts to sing.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the 
                         wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"

               Oda Mae stops. She turns back to the buzzer and rings once 
               more. Suddenly Molly answers.

                                     MOLLY (V.O.)
                         Hello, who's there?

                                     ODA MAE
                              (nervous)
                         Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I 
                         called you last night. Your friend 
                         Sam says you gotta talk to me.

               There is a CLICK as Molly hangs up.

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly walks away from the intercom, shaken. Suddenly we hear 
               Oda Mae yelling up from the street.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                         Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to 
                         me! this is for real. Sam is here. 
                         He needs to talk to you.

               Molly walks over to the window and looks down. Oda Mae is 
               standing in the street looking up. She is calling out at the 
               top of her lungs. Molly pulls back. She is afraid.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         He says remember the starfish at 
                         Montego Bay? Remember the picture he 
                         took a' you in Reno?
                              (pause)
                         Remember his green underwear, the 
                         pair you wrote your name on? She 
                         wrote her name on 'em?

               Molly tenses. There is a sign of recognition in her eyes.

               EXT. TRIBECA STREET - DAY

               Oda Mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to Molly's 
               fifth floor window. Several people stare at her curiously. 
               She turns to them.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Hey, do you mind? This here's a 
                         private conversation.

               The people turn away. She turns back to the window. Sam 
               prompts her.

                                     SAM
                         Ask her about the sweater in the 
                         closet, the one she knitted that's 
                         too big.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What about the sweater you knitted 
                         that was too big?

                                     SAM
                         Four sizes.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Four sizes.

                                     SAM
                         She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I 
                         was there.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You couldn't throw it out. He saw. 
                         He was there. This is for real. Hey 
                         do you hear me up there?

               A WORKMAN peers out of a second story window.

                                     WORKMAN
                         I hear you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm not talkin' to you.

                                     WORKMAN
                         Haven't you ever heard of phones?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Kiss my behind!
                              (yelling again)
                         Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all 
                         day.

                                     WORKMAN
                         Thank God.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it. I've had enough of this.

               Oda Mae is about to walk away when the entrance door opens. 
               Molly steps outside. Oda Mae sees her and stops.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Molly?
                              (Molly nods)
                         I'm Oda Mae Brown.
                              (walking over and 
                              shaking her hand)
                         You can call me Oda.

               INT. SOHO LUNCHEONETTE - DAY

               Molly and Oda Mae are sitting in a booth staring at one 
               another.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why should I believe you? Why should 
                         I believe any of this?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Girl, if you think I'd come down 
                         here for the fun of it, you got 
                         another think comin'. This Sam of 
                         yours... I don't know, lady. I mean, 
                         you ever hear a whole night of "Henry 
                         the Eighth I am?"

                                     MOLLY
                         He did that? That's how he got me to 
                         go out with him.

                                     ODA MAE
                         And he cain't carry a tune.

                                     MOLLY
                         I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy. 
                         I can't believe I'm talking to you 
                         like this. I don't believe in these 
                         things. I don't believe in life after 
                         death.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her she's wrong.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says you're wrong.

                                     MOLLY
                         You're talking to him right now?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What? You think I'm makin' it up?

                                     MOLLY
                         Where is he?

                                     ODA MAE
                         How should I know? It's not like I 
                         can see him. I just hear his voice.

                                     SAM
                         I'm holding her hand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he's holding your hand.

                                     MOLLY
                         I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why 
                         are you doing this to me? I don't 
                         believe a word you're saying. Sam is 
                         dead. He's dead.

                                     SAM
                         I'm holding her hand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he's holding your hand.

               Molly's hand jumps. Oda Mae looks at her. There is a long, 
               poignant moment. Sam chokes up.

                                     SAM
                         God, I love her. I love her so much.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he loves you... so much.

                                     MOLLY
                              (shaking her head)
                         No. He would never say that.

                                     SAM
                              (his eyes brightening)
                         Ditto. Tell her "ditto".

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ditto? What's that mean, ditto?

               Molly starts, an expression of true astonishment shining in 
               her eyes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam?

               INT. LOFT - DAY

               Molly is pressed up against the edge of the couch listening 
               nervously as Oda Mae speaks. Sam wanders around the room, 
               anxiously.

                                     ODA MAE
                         To tell the truth, I don't know how 
                         I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially, 
                         nothin' like this never happened to 
                         me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't 
                         turn it off.
                              (she sees a photo of 
                              Sam)
                         Is this you? Is this him?

               They both say "yes" at the same time.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                         Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd 
                         be blue.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't understand. Why did he come 
                         back? Why is he still here?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's 
                         between worlds. It happens sometimes, 
                         when their spirits get out too quick. 
                         He thinks he still has stuff t'do 
                         down here.

                                     SAM
                         Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude.

               Molly stares at Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         I do not have an attitude.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         We're having a discussion.
                              (back to Sam)
                         Whataya mean, you're not angry? If 
                         you weren't angry you wouldn't be 
                         raisin' your voice like that.

                                     SAM
                         Goddamn it, Oda Mae!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't 
                         talk to anybody who takes the Lord's 
                         name in vain.

               She stands up, as if to leave. Molly watches with growing 
               discomfort as Oda Mae seems to be talking to herself.

                                     SAM
                         Relax, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You relax. You're the dead one. You 
                         want my help, then you apologize. 
                         Nobody talks to me like that, 
                         understand?

                                     SAM
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.

               Oda Mae heads for the door. Molly is confused.

                                     MOLLY
                         I don't believe I'm watching this.

                                     SAM
                         Damn it. All right. I apologize.

               Oda Mae stops, pauses a moment, and walks back to the couch. 
               Sam, relieved, paces back and forth.

               Oda Mae's eyes follow his voice as Molly watches her 
               curiously.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell 
                         Molly what I'm saying. You gotta 
                         tell her word for word.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Monsieur has a message for you.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, you're in danger.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You can't tell her like that. And 
                         would you stop movin' all over the 
                         place? You're makin' me sick.

               Molly looks concerned. Sam leans into Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         Say it!

                                     ODA MAE
                         He's sayin' you're in danger.

                                     MOLLY
                         Danger?... What do you mean?

                                     SAM
                         I know the man who killed me. Willie 
                         Lopez. I know where he lives.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he knows the man who killed 
                         him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican.

               Molly grows pale as she listens. Her forehead tightens.

                                     SAM
                         Write it down.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Write it down.

                                     SAM
                         You do it!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Now I'm a secretary.

               Oda Mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil.

                                     SAM
                         321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.

                                     ODA MAE
                         321? Hey, that's my neighborhood.

               Oda Mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it 
               to Molly.

                                     SAM
                         Molly, he's got my wallet and my 
                         key. He was in here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He's got his wallet and key. He was 
                         in here.

                                     MOLLY
                         In here?

                                     SAM
                              (directly to Molly)
                         You have to go to the police. The 
                         Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a 
                         setup, Moll. I was murdered.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He says he was set up, that he was 
                         murdered. He wants you to go to the 
                         police.

               Molly stands up, afraid. Oda Mae stands up, too.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to 
                         do with this.

               Oda Mae heads for the door as Molly watches in a daze.

                                     SAM
                         Where you going?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Don't follow me! I've done all I'm 
                         gonna do.
                              (opening the door)
                         I'm finished. And I ain't comin' 
                         back. So don't you come botherin' me 
                         again cause it's over. I mean it. 
                         This is it. Have a nice life. Have a 
                         nice death. I'm goin'.

               She lets herself out. Sam just stands there as the door slams 
               shut.

               OMITTED

               INT. KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

               Carl is pacing nervously. He seems very upset. After a moment 
               he approaches Molly. Sam is behind her.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, there's no one on earth who'd 
                         like it to be true more than me, but 
                         you've got to be rational about this. 
                         I understand your desire to hold on 
                         to him, but this... this is absurd.

                                     MOLLY
                         It was real, Carl. She was real.

                                     SAM
                         Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She 
                         needs some support here.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, you're a grown woman. How can 
                         you believe some fortune teller from 
                         Brooklyn...?

                                     MOLLY
                         She was in touch with him.

                                     CARL
                         I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a 
                         minute.

                                     SAM
                         Come on, Carl. Open your mind.

               Carl sits down beside her.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, she knew things.

                                     CARL
                         What kind of things?

                                     MOLLY
                         I told you, the picture in Reno, the 
                         starfish,... damn it, Carl.
                              (with great difficulty)
                         She said Sam knew who killed him. 
                         That he was set up... murdered.

                                     CARL
                         Oh boy. This is getting deranged. 
                         We're going off the deep end here.

                                     SAM
                         Give him the address, Moll.

                                     MOLLY
                         She had a name, an address -- Willie 
                         Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said 
                         he had Sam's wallet.

               Sam smiles. Carl stands up. His voice begins to rise.

                                     CARL
                         This is sick. This is really sick. 
                         How can you swallow this crap? Who 
                         knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's 
                         just setting someone up.

                                     MOLLY
                         That's what I have to find out.

                                     CARL
                         Find out? What are you talking about?

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam wants me to go to the police.

                                     CARL
                         Sam wants you to go to the police? 
                         Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your 
                         mind? What are you gonna tell 'em? 
                         Some storefront psychic's been getting 
                         messages from the dead? Do you know 
                         how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts 
                         here, for God's sake.

               Molly looks suddenly vulnerable.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I'm sorry. This stuff just really 
                         gets to me.

                                     MOLLY
                         You don't believe me. You don't 
                         believe any of this, do you?

                                     CARL
                              (half heartedly)
                         I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll 
                         make you sleep any better, I'll check 
                         it out, okay? Now why don't you go 
                         to bed. Try and get some sleep.

               Molly looks at Carl, annoyed. She doesn't believe him for a 
               second.

               INT. CARL'S CAR - NIGHT

               Carl, in his red Ford Mustang, is speeding up town. Sam is 
               beside him in the front seat.

               INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Carl steps into the lobby of Willie's building. Sam follows, 
               wide-eyed. He seems both intrigued and astounded by what 
               Carl is doing. When Carl stops to read the apartment number 
               on Willie's mail box, Sam is thrilled.

                                     SAM
                         Way to go, Carl!

               Carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches Willie's 
               door. He bangs on it, loudly.

               ANGLE - THE DOOR

               opens a crack as Willie peers out. Carl pushes it hard and 
               it opens the rest of the way. Willie steps back.

                                     WILLIE
                         Carl, what're you doin' here?

               Sam freezes as Willie addresses Carl by name. He can barely 
               move.

                                     CARL
                              (scared, in over his 
                              head)
                         Who've you been talking to?

                                     WILLIE
                         Talking to? What the hell do you 
                         mean? What's going on?

                                     CARL
                         Some woman knows all about you. The 
                         murder, everything. Where's she 
                         getting it from, huh?

                                     WILLIE
                         What the hell are you talking about? 
                         I haven't said a word.

               Sam is staggered. His body is shaking.

                                     CARL
                         She knows your name, goddamn it! She 
                         knows where you live!

                                     WILLIE
                         A lot of women know where I live.

               Carl is fuming.

                                     CARL
                         This isn't a joke, man. You find 
                         that bitch, whoever she is, and... 
                         get rid of her, you hear me? I've 
                         got four million dollars stuck in 
                         that fucking computer. If I don't 
                         get those codes, if that money's not 
                         transferred soon, I'm dead. If I 
                         lose Balistrari's money, we're both 
                         dead.

                                     WILLIE
                         Tell him you only wash dirty money 
                         on the first of the month.

                                     CARL
                         What is wrong with you? Is everything 
                         a joke? You were supposed to steal 
                         his wallet. You weren't supposed to 
                         kill him. Was that a joke?

                                     WILLIE
                              (casually)
                         I did you a favor. Freebee.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus!
                              (sickened)
                         These are drug dealers, man.
                              (pause)
                         Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've 
                         risked my job here. I could go to 
                         jail. A hundred thousand of that 
                         money goes to me. Now give me Sam's 
                         key. I'll get that address book 
                         myself.

               Willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key. Sam, 
               unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. Hauling 
               back, he slugs Carl with all his might. His fist has no 
               impact.

                                     SAM
                         You killed me, Carl. You had me 
                         killed. Look what you've done to me! 
                         Look what you've done!

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Carl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside 
               him, yelling right into his face.

               He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl 
               doesn't hear him.

                                     SAM
                         You fucker! You mother fucker! I had 
                         a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!

               From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like 
               hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is 
               nothing he can do.

               EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY

               Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab. 
               She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling.

                                     MOLLY
                         You white fascist bigot. Who do you 
                         think you are? Bed Stuy's part of 
                         New York, you know. This is America.

               The driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - ELEVATED TRAIN - DAY

               Molly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street. 
               She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as 
               she passes.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?

               Molly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and 
               run away.

               TRACKING SHOT

               When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and 
               she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A 
               group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks 
               by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking.

               EXT./INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING

               Molly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby. 
               It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines 
               the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away, 
               afraid.

               INT. LIVINGROOM - DAY

               A dresser drawer opens and a box labeled "Sam's Things -- 
               Valuable" is slowly pulled out. A hand reaches inside it and 
               extracts Sam's address book. As THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we 
               see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom. 
               Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code 
               numbers he finds in the back. His eyes sparkle with 
               excitement.

               INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Molly is sitting in a room opposite DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS 
               BEIDERMAN, 48, and SERGEANT DOROTHY WALLACE, 29. Both officers 
               are staring at her as she speaks. She seems very 
               uncomfortable.

                                     MOLLY
                         Look, you've gotta believe me. I 
                         don't even believe this stuff, myself. 
                         But this is real. Do you think I'd 
                         come here if it wasn't real? You 
                         told me to come if I had any new 
                         information. Well, here I am.

               The officers don't respond.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Don't look at me like that. You guys 
                         use psychics all the time.

               There is dead silence.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Damn it. I know how this sounds. I 
                         hear myself saying it and I want to 
                         cringe. But this woman knew things 
                         she couldn't have known, intimate 
                         details.

                                     WALLACE
                         How intimate?

                                     MOLLY
                         Things Sam only said to me.

                                     WALLACE
                              (smirking)
                         Okay, let me get this straight. 
                         According to this psychic lady, there 
                         are ghosts and spirits all over the 
                         place, watching us all the time, 
                         huh?...
                              (she stands up)
                         I'm sorry. I've got important things 
                         to do.

               She leaves the room. Molly gives her a dirty look and turns 
               to Beiderman.

                                     MOLLY
                         I'm telling you. The killer's name 
                         is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. 
                         You've got to check it out.

               Sgt. Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         Okay. You just wait here. Let me see 
                         if this guy's got a record.

               He heads out of the room. Molly sits back with an air of 
               enormous relief and gratitude. Sergeant Wallace comes into 
               the room again and picks up a folder. Molly waits nervously. 
               After a moment Sergeant Beiderman returns with a police file 
               in his hands. Molly looks up at him, and then smiles at 
               Wallace as she sees it. She feels vindicated. He lays the 
               thick folder on the desk and opens it up. She hurries over 
               to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MUG SHOTS OF ODA MAE

               and reams of police paperwork. WIDEN as Molly stares at it 
               all in sudden shock.

                                     MOLLY
                         What are you doing? Where's your 
                         file on Willie Lopez?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         There's no file for a Willie Lopez. 
                         He was probably some old boyfriend 
                         she was trying to get even with. 
                         This psychic woman's record goes 
                         back a long way. Fraud, numbers 
                         rackets, you name it. She's a real 
                         pro.

               CUT BACK AND FORTH between the records and Molly's stunned 
               reaction. We see recent photos of Oda Mae and others going 
               back to her youth. They are fascinating and revealing. We 
               even see photos of her mother and grandmother. In addition, 
               there are pages of arrest records and prison files.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery, 
                         selling false ID. Served one year. 
                         1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud, 
                         numbers racketeering. Served ten 
                         months. 1974. Hattiesburg, 
                         Mississippi. Fraud, seven months. 
                         1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny. 
                         It goes on and on.

               Molly is overwhelmed by the evidence.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         This woman's a charlatan. You can't 
                         believe anything she said.

                                     MOLLY
                         This isn't possible. There were words, 
                         private things. How could she have 
                         known all that?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         They have ways.

                                     MOLLY
                         Ways? What ways?

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         They've got a million cons. A lot of 
                         times they read the obits. All she 
                         had to do was see the word "banker". 
                         Hell, they even go through your 
                         garbage to find things they can use, 
                         letters, old papers. They don't need 
                         much.

               Molly turns away.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It 
                         could have been anything. What about 
                         that underwear she knew all about?

               Molly's eyes widen.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                              (continuing)
                         Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed 
                         right in on that.

                                     MOLLY
                         No! She was real. She said things. 
                         She knew about a sweater I knitted, 
                         about songs we sang... She knew about 
                         this place we went, Montego Bay...

               Molly begins to cry.

                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN
                         I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People 
                         want so much to believe. They're 
                         grieving, vulnerable. They'd give 
                         anything for one last moment... money, 
                         insurance policies. Believe me, these 
                         people know what they're doing. Look, 
                         I know how you must feel. You know, 
                         you can press charges.

               Molly shakes her head no. Sgt. Beiderman closes the file. 
               Molly sits for a long time. She is in terrible pain.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.

               Sgt. Beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns 
               away.

               INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (THE SAME DAY)

               Molly is sitting in her bedroom. The glow of the late 
               afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed. She 
               seems deeply depressed and alone. Gradually her gaze falls 
               on a jar sitting on the nightstand. In it is the penny Sam 
               found when they were first working on the loft. A label on 
               the jar says, "For Luck!" In a moment of sudden rage, she 
               picks it up and throws it against the wall. It SHATTERS on 
               the floor.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The code from Sam's address book, jotted on a piece of paper, 
               is sitting beside Carl.

                                     CARL
                              (excitedly)
                         God, let this be it!

               Anxiously, Carl punches the code into a computer and, 
               suddenly, Sam's old accounts appear on the screen. A look of 
               relief wafts across Carl's face.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Oh God, yes!

               Carl is staring at the same accounts Sam was examining the 
               afternoon before he was killed, the accounts with too much 
               money in them.

               Carl picks up the phone and punches a number. Someone answers.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set. 
                         We're fine. Everything's fine. Just 
                         tell me what you want me to do.

               A VOICE on the other end begins to speak.

                                     VOICE
                         We want you to transfer the money 
                         from the 12 separate accounts into a 
                         single account under the name "Rita 
                         Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes

                         I'll do that.

               Carl hangs up. He seems deeply relieved.

               He is standing in front of Carl, watching. Quickly, Carl 
               begins punching commands into the computer. He is setting up 
               the dummy account. Rita Miller, #926-31043.

               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT

               Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A 
               magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the 
               loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back 
               and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.

                                     SAM
                         Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need 
                         you.

               Suddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps.

               Molly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled.

                                     MOLLY
                         Who's there?

                                     CARL
                         Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?

               Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and 
               then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding 
               up the stairs.

                                     SAM
                         Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!

               There is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant, 
               almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is 
               still in a suit and tie.

                                     CARL
                         Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm 
                         sorry to disturb you. I felt bad 
                         about last night. This supernatural 
                         stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. 
                         I don't even read horoscopes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Don't worry. It's okay.

                                     CARL
                         No it's not. You needed me to hear 
                         you and I didn't and that was wrong. 
                         I want you to know that I'm your 
                         friend, Moll.

                                     SAM
                         You were never our friend.

                                     CARL

                              bag)
                         Hey, I brought you some Japanese 
                         apple pears. I know you like them.

                                     MOLLY
                              (taking the bag)
                         Oh, that's so sweet.

                                     CARL
                         Listen, can I come in for a minute? 
                         I won't stay long. I've had one of 
                         those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?

                                     SAM
                         No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him 
                         in!

                                     MOLLY
                              (hesitating)
                         Sure.

               INT. LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Carl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on 
               the couch drinking coffee. We notice that Carl is wearing 
               yellow suspenders. Sam is beside himself, watching them.

                                     MOLLY
                         Are you alright? You look nervous, 
                         upset.

                                     CARL
                              (glancing at her thighs)
                         What can I tell you. It's been tough. 
                         Hell, you know. It still hurts so 
                         much.
                              (he poses sadly)
                         Then on top of it all... it's the 
                         responsibilities. They've given me 
                         my own accounts, but I've had no 
                         time to adjust. My mind has been 
                         reeling.

               Molly reaches out and pats his arm. There is an awkward pause.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Where were you this morning? I thought 
                         you were coming to the bank to sign 
                         those papers.

                                     MOLLY
                         I didn't have time.
                              (beat)
                         I went to the police, Carl.

               Sam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens. 
               He laughs nervously.

                                     CARL
                         You're kidding. You really did it? I 
                         don't believe... What did you tell 
                         them? What did they say?

                                     MOLLY
                         You were right, you know. I felt 
                         like such a fool. They brought out a 
                         file on this psychic woman ten inches 
                         thick. It was awful.

                                     CARL
                              (relieved)
                         A ripoff artist, huh?

                                     SAM
                              (shocked)
                         Molly, no.

                                     MOLLY
                         The sad part is that I believed her. 
                         I believed her, Carl.
                              (pause)
                         It was all a sham.

                                     CARL
                              (relaxing)
                         Sometimes we need to believe.

                                     MOLLY
                         Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe 
                         anything anymore. Why would people 
                         do such things?

               Sam is devastated.

                                     CARL
                              (milking it)
                         It's hard to face reality, Moll, the 
                         hard cold facts of it. What you have 
                         to remember is the love you felt. 
                         That's what's real. You have to 
                         remember how good Sam was. How much 
                         he loved you.

               Molly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes 
               her hair.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         You were everything to him, Molly. 
                         You were his life.

                                     MOLLY
                              (finally crying)
                         I feel so alone.

                                     CARL
                         You're not alone. You're young. You've 
                         got so much talent. You're 
                         fantastically gorgeous.

                                     MOLLY
                              (appreciating his 
                              words)
                         Oh God, I don't know what's real 
                         anymore. I don't know what to think.

                                     CARL
                         Just think about Sam. Think about 
                         what he meant to you, the years you 
                         had together, how wonderful they 
                         were.

               Carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Let your feelings out.

               Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her 
               neck. As she moves, her robe opens slightly. Carl notices, 
               glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. Sam notices, too. He 
               freezes.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Life turns on a dime, Moll. People 
                         think they have forever, that they'll 
                         always have tomorrow. But it's not 
                         true. Sam taught us that. We have to 
                         live for now, for today.

               Molly can barely contain her tears. Carl moves toward her 
               moist cheeks and kisses them gently. Slowly, he guides his 
               lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and 
               sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.

               Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice 
               his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling 
               it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the 
               robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what 
               to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For 
               a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her 
               thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls 
               closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.

               Molly's eyes close. She says nothing.

                                     SAM
                         No!!!

               OMITTED

               ANGLE

               Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing 
               uncontrollably at the two of them. Unexpectedly his foot 
               kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's 
               sitting on an end table. The picture CRASHES to the floor, 
               the glass SHATTERING.

               Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo 
               and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away.

               Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries 
               kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot 
               goes right through it.

               Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears.

                                     MOLLY
                         I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's 
                         too soon... You've been great Carl, 
                         but... I need you to leave. Please. 
                         I need you to.

                                     CARL
                         Sure. It's okay. I understand. I 
                         really do.

               She reaches out and takes his hand.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow 
                         night? Just talk. Can I interest you 
                         in that?

                                     SAM
                         NO!!!

               Molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head "yes". Carl 
               smiles.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

               Sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway 
               station. A train is just leaving. He jumps on board.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT

               Sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something. 
               It is not there. Another train can be seen speeding past the 
               window. Sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing 
               through the walls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMITTED

               ANGLE - SAM

               disappointed. Suddenly, an express train passes alongside 
               his local. Sam sticks his face inside it. Suddenly, he smiles 
               and rushes onto it.

               ANGLE

               Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the 
               terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. 
               We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue 
               pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained 
               teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.

                                     GHOST
                         Get off my train!

               This time Sam does not back away. He holds his ground. The 
               Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. Posters come 
               flying off the walls. A bag of groceries topples from a 
               woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a 
               boy's Mets cap flips off his head. People on the train move 
               quickly to other cars.

               Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach. 
               Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. He is angry 
               now. He begins raging at the other Ghost. The Ghost is 
               shocked.

                                     SAM
                         Teach me how you do that! I want to 
                         learn! I'm not leaving til you teach 
                         me!

               The Ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with 
               appreciation.

                                     GHOST
                         You stubborn asshole.

               Sam nods in agreement.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM AND THE GHOST

               sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station. Sam is 
               trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         What are you doing? What are you 
                         doing? You can't push it with your 
                         finger. You're dead.

               The Ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side. 
               Sam can't quite tell how he did it.

                                     SAM
                         I don't get it.

                                     GHOST
                         It's your mind, you idiot. It's all 
                         in the mind. The problem is you think 
                         you're still real, that you're 
                         standin' on the floor, that you're 
                         wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You 
                         don't even have a body anymore. It's 
                         all up here. You wanna move things, 
                         you gotta use your mind. You gotta 
                         focus! You hear what I'm saying?

                                     SAM
                         How do you focus?

                                     GHOST
                         I don't know how you focus! You just 
                         focus!

               With surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and 
               sends it shooting across the subway platform.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         It's all in the anger. You gotta 
                         direct it. You gotta channel it.

                                     SAM
                         I'm angry all the time. It doesn't 
                         do a thing.

                                     GHOST
                         Cause you're angry all over. You 
                         gotta be angry here, in the pit of 
                         your stomach. Bring it down here. 
                         Let it explode.
                              (he makes an explosive 
                              gesture)
                         It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!

               He kicks a Coke can toward Sam. Sam tries to kick it back 
               and misses. The Ghost laughs. Sam gets angry. He tries again 
               and falls on his head. The Ghost laughs louder. Now Sam is 
               really angry. We see him forcing the anger down into his 
               stomach. He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the 
               can with all his might. To his shock and amazement, it sails 
               right through the Ghost's head. The Ghost smiles.

                                     SAM
                         I did it!

                                     GHOST
                         Way to go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM

               practicing. He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his 
               fist. Nothing happens.

                                     GHOST
                         From your gut. What do I keep tellin' 
                         you?

               Sam's stomach bulges. He tries again. Nothing.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         Give it time! What else have you 
                         got?

               Undaunted, Sam tries once more. This time the tennis shoe 
               moves. The Ghost nods his head approvingly. Sam is thrilled.

                                     SAM
                         How long have you been here?

                                     GHOST
                         Since they pushed me.

                                     SAM
                         Someone pushed you?

                                     GHOST
                         Yeah, someone pushed me!

                                     SAM
                         Who?

                                     GHOST
                         What? You don't believe me? You think 
                         I fell? You think I jumped? Well, 
                         fuck you!
                              (an unexpected rage 
                              starts to build)
                         It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed 
                         to go! I'm not supposed to be here!

               Venom spews from the Ghost's mouth. Suddenly he rams a 
               cigarette machine full force with his head. The glass SHATTERS 
               and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere. He throws himself 
               on top of them with terrible longing.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         I'd give everything for a drag. Just 
                         one drag.

               He rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the 
               cigarettes in all directions. Suddenly he looks up and sees 
               Sam. He is unable to control his fury.

                                     GHOST
                              (continuing)
                         Who the hell are you? Why are you 
                         hounding me like this? Leave me alone.

               AN EXPRESS TRAIN

               is shooting through the station. The Ghost throws himself 
               into it and in an instant he is gone.

               OMITTED

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

               Sam, all alone, walks through the station. Suddenly, he 
               reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid. It swings back and 
               forth. He is delighted. A beer can is sitting on a bench. He 
               pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with 
               childlike glee.

               Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security 
               Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. "Special 
               Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you." 
               Something registers in Sam's eyes. He yells and jumps straight 
               up, hitting a subway sign with his finger. With great 
               excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the 
               station.

               OMITTED

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               ORTISHA JONES, a black woman with brassy red hair, is sitting 
               at Oda Mae's seance table surrounded by several of her 
               relatives. Clara and Louise stand behind Oda Mae helping 
               with the ritual. Oda Mae goes into her trance.

               ANGLE

               A GROUP OF GHOSTS is milling behind Oda Mae. Sam comes barging 
               into the room and looks at them in amazement.

                                     SAM
                         What the hell?

               Oda Mae, startled, jumps up in her chair. Everyone else jumps, 
               too. Clara and Louise look worried.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         What is all this? What's goin' on?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What'd you do, tell every spook in 
                         town about me? I got spooks from out 
                         of town here. There's stuff goin' on 
                         you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly 
                         believe it myself.

               Ortisha and her relatives look up, confused.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is 
                         for real. How do you like that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I don't.

                                     SAM
                         Come on. Look at this. You're doing 
                         great.

               One of the GHOSTS standing in the background butts in.

                                     GHOST
                         Can you hurry this up? My husband's 
                         in the waiting room.

                                     SAM
                         I need your help, Oda Mae. There's 
                         something we need to do.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Forget it. I'm not doin' anything. 
                         You're holdin' on to a life that 
                         don't want you no more. Give it up.

                                     SAM
                         Give it up? I'm already dead.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished 
                         dyin'. Give up the ghost.

                                     SAM
                         And how am I supposed to do that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         You're asking me?

               Ortisha looks at Oda Mae. She has no idea what's going on.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Are you speaking to me?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Does it look like I'm speakin' to 
                         you?
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                         So, are you gonna leave or not? I've 
                         got work to do.

               Ortisha is totally confused. Oda Mae turns back to her.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         What's a matter? You're supposed to 
                         be concentrating. How do you expect 
                         me to do this if you're not 
                         concentrating? Okay then. You ready? 
                         Let's do it.

               ANGLE

               Oda Mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet. One of the 
               ghosts draws close. Oda Mae's eyes roll up into her head. 
               Then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs. We see the 
               spirit pull back and dive right into Oda Mae. Oda Mae gulps. 
               Her nostrils flare. Her eyes bulge.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me?

               Oda Mae's body goes into bizarre convulsions as the Ghost 
               tries to move inside her. She looks strangely stuffed and 
               enormously uncomfortable.

               Sam and the others watch in astonishment as she tries to 
               speak, but nothing comes out.

               Then suddenly the GHOST speaks through Oda Mae.

                                     ORLANDO
                              (screaming)
                         Ortisha?!

               Ortisha and her relatives jump up in amazement.

                                     ORTISHA
                              (excitedly)
                         Orlando! Is that you?

                                     ORLANDO
                              (disoriented)
                         Ortisha, where are you? I can't see 
                         too good.

                                     RELATIVES
                         Here! She's here!

                                     ORTISHA
                         In front of you! I'm right here!

               Orlando suddenly zeros in on Ortisha. His eyes widen.

                                     ORLANDO
                         Mother of God, what've you done to 
                         your hair!?

               Ortisha smiles excitedly.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Orlando, do you like it? It's Autumn 
                         Sunrise.

               Suddenly Oda Mae's body begins to shake wildly and her voice 
               booms out, screaming with all her might.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Get out of here, you little shit!

               With frightening speed, she sends the spirit catapulting out 
               of her body. Clara and Louise jump up. Oda Mae is shaking.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that 
                         to me!

                              (confused)
                         Orlando!?

               ANGLE ORLANDO

               He is lying on the floor, exhausted.

                                     ORLANDO
                         What happened to me? I can barely 
                         move.

                                     GHOST
                         You should know better than to try 
                         that. It's not worth it. It'll wipe 
                         you out for days.

                                     SAM
                         That was incredible, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Never again. Never.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Where's Orlando?

                                     SAM
                         He spoke through you. It was amazing.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No more, uh uh, no more.

                                     ORTISHA
                         What happened to Orlando? Where'd he 
                         leave the insurance policy?

                                     SAM
                         You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real 
                         medium. It's what you were born for.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I want everybody out.

                                     ORTISHA
                         Orlando?

               Ortisha looks around the room, befuddled. Clara and Louise 
               aren't sure what to do.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Now!

               Ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast. The ghosts, too, 
               begin passing through the wall. Oda Mae lays her head on the 
               table. Suddenly her whole body begins heaving. She is starting 
               to cry. Sam is surprised.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, what's wrong?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Out! I said out! That means you, 
                         too!

               Sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the 
               others through the wall.

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Clara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in.

                                     CLARA
                         Oda Mae, there's a man here who says 
                         he has to see you right away.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I ain't seein' nobody.

               Willie pushes his way into the room. Clara isn't sure what 
               to do. Oda Mae looks up. She does not know him.

                                     WILLIE
                         Are you the one that can talk to the 
                         dead?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing 
                         customers right now.

                                     WILLIE
                         I said I need to know if you're the 
                         one.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm the one. But not now.

                                     WILLIE
                         This is important. I have a friend. 
                         He died recently. Some say he was 
                         mugged. I think he was murdered.

               Oda Mae stares at him curiously.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         I'm told you can contact people like 
                         that. Is that true?

                                     ODA MAE
                         It's been known to happen. But it's 
                         not gonna happen now, so come back 
                         later.

                                     WILLIE
                         I can't wait til later.

               He sits down across from Oda Mae and shows no signs of 
               leaving. Oda Mae observes him quietly for a moment.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What's your friend's name?

                                     WILLIE
                         Good question. Why don't you tell 
                         me?

               Oda Mae glares at him.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         You're the psychic, right?

                                     ODA MAE
                         This ain't no guessin' game.

                                     WILLIE
                         Then what is it, lady?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lookit, I don't know what your trouble 
                         is...
                              (getting nervous)
                         Who are you?

                                     WILLIE
                         You're the mindreader. I hear you've 
                         been tellin' people about me for 
                         days. What's my name?

               ANGLE - ODA MAE

               confused and uncomfortable. Sam comes wandering back into 
               the room. His eyes bulge.

                                     SAM
                         Willie!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Willie!?

               Willie sits straight up in his chair, amazed.

                                     WILLIE
                         How'd you know that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Because I'm psychic.

               With a sudden thrust, Oda Mae sends her foot shooting into 
               Willie's balls. As he recoils she knocks the table into his 
               lap and rushes for the closet. We see her barricade herself 
               in the hidden chamber.

               Willie, shaking, scrambles to his feet and, before Sam can 
               stop him, BLASTS his gun at the closet door. It is riddled 
               with bullets. Sam screams out. Willie runs to the side door 
               and escapes to the street. Clara and Louise come rushing in.

               Sam charges into the closet and sees that Oda Mae is safe 
               behind the false door. Then he hurries to the street.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Sam rushes to the sidewalk and looks in all directions. Willie 
               is nowhere to be seen. He hurries back to Oda Mae.

               OMITTED

               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

               The room is a disaster area, full of hysterical women. Oda 
               Mae is being dragged from the closet, unhurt but in a state 
               of shock.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He tried to kill me! Why? Why?

               No one answers.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Talk to me!

               Her sisters start talking but she shoos them away.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, we're in trouble...

                                     ODA MAE
                         We're in trouble? Who's we? You're 
                         already dead.

                                     SAM
                         I can stop them. But I can't do it 
                         alone. You've gotta help me.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Help you? It's me they're tryin' to 
                         kill.

                                     SAM
                         You're right. And they'll be back. 
                         I'm your only chance.

                         and rattle some chains.

                         I need you Oda Mae. I need you to 
                         get some fake ID's.

                         Help me now, they'll never bother 
                         you again. I promise.

                         Help you? Whataya talking about 
                         exactly? What else do I have to do?

               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

               Oda Mae, dressed to the hilt, is walking with Sam toward the 
               main branch of Market Security Bank & Trust. She seems nervous 
               and upset.

                                     ODA MAE
                         This is crazy. This ain't gonna work. 
                         I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'.

                                     SAM
                         I'll teach you. You'll learn fast.

               As they reach the entrance of the bank, they pass a pair of 
               NUNS collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless. 
               One of them holds out a collection box. Oda Mae passes her 
               by, carefully avoiding eye contact.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Oda Mae enters Sam's bank. She seems completely out of place. 
               Sam, walking beside her, directs her every move.

                                     SAM
                         See where it says "New Accounts"? 
                         That's where you're going.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (paranoid)
                         I'm not givin' 'em any money.

                                     SAM
                         Just do what I say.

               Oda Mae approaches the New Accounts desk. She seems very 
               uptight. A woman OFFICER behind the desk looks up at her.

                                     OFFICER
                         Can I help you?

                         in today.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Carl Bruner opened it for me. He 
                         asked me to come in today.

                                     OFFICER
                         Ah.

               The Officer checks out the name and account number on her 
               computer screen. It all seems to jive. She pulls out a card 
               from her desk and hands it to Oda Mae. Oda Mae stares at it.

                                     SAM
                         Just sign you name at the bottom on 
                         the first blank line.

               Oda Mae nods and starts to sign "Oda Mae". Sam stops her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         No, no, no. Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to the officer)
                         Can I have another one please? I 
                         signed the wrong name.

               Sam hits his forehead with his hand. The Officer gives her 
               another card. Oda Mae signs it.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her to see that it goes right 
                         up to the third floor file since you 
                         have a transaction to make.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I need you to put that in the third 
                         floor file cause I got a transfusion 
                         to make.

                                     OFFICER
                         A what?

                                     ODA MAE
                         You know what I mean.
                              (innocently)
                         Umm, can I keep the pen?

                                     OFFICER
                              (surprised, not sure 
                              what to say)
                         ...uh, sure.

               Oda Mae, delighted, walks away smiling and gives the officer 
               a wave. She is loving this.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Thanks.

               The clock on Carl's wall says 3:40. He seems anxious. The 
               phone RINGS. Carl jumps. He pushes down the speaker button.

                                     CARL
                         Hello. Carl Bruner speaking.

                         Carl?

                                     CARL
                         Mr. Balsitrari

                                     VOICE
                         Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John. 
                         I've got the info on the Bradley 
                         portfolio.

                                     CARL
                         Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll 
                         pick it up later.

               He hangs up. His hand is shaking.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing 
               administrative personnel. They approach a GUARD who is 
               standing there.

                                     SAM
                         Tell the guard you're here to see 
                         Lyle Furgeson.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Lyle Furgeson, please.

                                     GUARD
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     ODA MAE
                         No. I'm here for the fun of it.

                                     SAM
                         Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's 
                         here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Tell him Rita Miller's here.

                                     GUARD
                         Just one moment, please.

                                     SAM
                         Don't embellish.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Yes, Sir.

                                     GUARD
                              (turning around)
                         Excuse me?

               She waves him on.

                                     SAM
                              (whispering)
                         Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a 
                         real jerk.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Why are you whispering?

                                     SAM
                              (he doesn't know)
                         Just be quiet and listen. I've known 
                         him five years and he still thinks 
                         my name's Paul.

               We see the Guard leaning over Mr. Furgeson's desk. FURGESON 
               looks up and sees Oda Mae. He shrugs his shoulders.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         He's a social moron. You don't have 
                         to worry about anything. Tell the 
                         guard Furgeson knows you. You spent 
                         time with him and his wife Shirley 
                         at the Brewster's Christmas party 
                         last year.

               The Guard comes back.

                                     GUARD
                         What is this regarding?

                                     ODA MAE
                         What? He doesn't remember me? We 
                         were together at the Brewster's 
                         Christmas party. With his wife 
                         Shirley. They had that lovely tree... 
                         all those presents. Why, I'll never 
                         forget all those beautiful...

               Sam pokes her. She yelps, surprised, and glances around. The 
               Guard gives her an odd look.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Oops. Gas.

               She forces a smile. He smiles back and then goes over to Mr. 
               Furgeson.

                                     SAM
                         This'll be easy. Furgeson was so 
                         drunk at that party, he could have 
                         had a conversation with Tina Turner 
                         and he wouldn't remember.

               The Guard whispers in Furgeson's ear. Furgeson appears totally 
               flummoxed. He looks up at Oda Mae, embarrassed, and waves. 
               The Guard motions her to come back. She walks proudly over 
               to his desk. He sticks out his hand.

                                     FURGESON
                         Hello, hello. Of course, of course. 
                         It's been so long.

                                     ODA MAE
                         A long time.

                                     SAM
                         Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.

                                     ODA MAE
                         How are Bobby and Snooky doin'?

                                     FURGESON
                              (perplexed)
                         Why, they're just fine, thank you. 
                         Nice of you to ask. And how is your... 
                         family?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Couldn't be better.

                                     FURGESON
                         Well, isn't that wonderful.

                                     SAM
                         Tell him you've been wondering how 
                         they did on the Gibraltar securities.

                                     ODA MAE
                         So tell me, Fergie, how did you do 
                         on the Gibraltar securities?

                                     FURGESON
                              (surprised)
                         The Gibraltar securities! Well, it 
                         looks like we topped out, huh?

                                     SAM
                         "We sure did!"

                                     ODA MAE
                         We sure did.

                                     FURGESON
                              (impressed)
                         That was a wonderful tip.

                                     SAM
                         "Good old Randy".

                                     ODA MAE
                         Good old Randy. Got a real head on 
                         his shoulders.

                                     SAM
                         "Her" shoulders.

                                     ODA MAE
                         "Her" shoulders.

                                     FURGESON
                         Sure does. Well... well. So what 
                         brings you here today?

                                     SAM
                         You're closing an account.

                                     ODA MAE
                         I'm closing an account.

                                     FURGESON
                         Well... wonderful. Do you have your 
                         account number?

                                     SAM
                         926-31043.

                                     ODA MAE
                         926-3143.

                                     SAM
                         31-0-43.

               She looks up into the air. Furgeson eyes her strangely.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm 
                         dyslexic.

               He punches Rita Miller's number into the computer. A figure 
               appears on the screen. He stares at it for a few seconds and 
               then punches it in again.

                                     FURGESON
                              (trying to be calm)
                         Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing 
                         four million dollars from us today, 
                         is that correct?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Four million dollars?!

                                     SAM
                         Say "yes"!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (gasping)
                         Yes! Four million. That's right. 
                         That's right.

                                     FURGESON
                         And how will you want that?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Tens and twenties?

                                     FURGESON
                         Pardon?

                                     SAM
                         A cashier's check! Tell him a 
                         cashier's check.

                                     ODA MAE
                         A cashier's check.

                                     FURGESON
                         Fine. Of course, you realize we're 
                         required to get some identification 
                         from everyone. It's just procedural. 
                         You understand.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Of course.

               Oda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S 
               LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and 
               walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An 
               OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a 
               stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles.

                                     ODA MAE
                         You know, if you put that Brillo pad 
                         in the freezer, it'll last twice as 
                         long.

               The Officer nods appreciatively.

               INT. CARD FILE ROOM - DAY

               Furgeson lays Oda Mae's ID next to her signature card. The 
               signatures match up. He nods his head in approval.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY

               Carl looks up at the clock. It is 3:50. He pushes down a 
               button on the phone. A SECRETARY answers.

                                     SECRETARY (V.O.)
                         Yes, Mr. Bruner.

                                     CARL
                         Get me the First Island Bank of 
                         Nassau. It's on the rolodex.

               INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Mr. Furgeson returns with Rita Miller's signature card and a 
               cashier's check for $4,000,000. Oda Mae's hand shakes as she 
               examines it.

                                     FURGESON
                         I'll just need your signature right 
                         here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sure.

                                     SAM
                         Sign Rita Miller.

               Sam looks up and gulps. Molly has just entered the bank and 
               is heading toward them. He jumps up nervously.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         I'll be back in a minute. You're on 
                         your own. Don't say anything foolish.

               Oda Mae signs a form closing the account. Of course the 
               signatures match. Mr. Furgeson examines them both and smiles. 
               He shakes Oda Mae's hand.

                                     FURGESON
                         Now you be careful with this. It's 
                         like carrying cash, you know.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (positively glowing)
                         I sure do.

               Sam rushes over to Molly. He is not sure what to do. He 
               notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about 
               to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a 
               hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused, 
               thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam, 
               delighted, flicks another stack.

               Oda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Then my mother took all the money 
                         from the oil wells and put it in 
                         gasoline pumps. Every gas station 
                         has 'em you know, sometimes six or 
                         more. It adds up.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out 
                         of here. Say goodbye.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (abruptly getting up)
                         Well, I've got to leave. It's been a 
                         pleasure doin' business with you. 
                         Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for 
                         me.

                                     FURGESON
                         Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to.

               Oda Mae smiles and leaves. There is a new lilt in her walk. 
               Suddenly Sam looks and sees Molly about to stand up.

                                     SAM
                         Hurry up, Oda Mae.

               At that second, Oda Mae spots a quarter lying on the ground. 
               She stoops down and picks it up.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (excitedly)
                         What a day!

               Molly sees her, does a double take, and starts to go after 
               her. Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before 
               Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment 
               and then looks back across to the executive area. She sees 
               Lionel Furgeson and hurries over to him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Lionel?

               He is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous.

                                     FURGESON
                         Molly. How are you?

                                     MOLLY
                         Lionel, a woman who just left, a 
                         black lady, about my height, did you 
                         see her?

                                     FURGESON
                         Well, yes. I just took care of her.

                                     MOLLY
                         What did she want? Did it have 
                         anything to do with me? Did she ask 
                         about Sam?

                                     FURGESON
                              (not understanding)
                         Sam? No. Why?

                                     MOLLY
                         Was her name Oda Mae Brown?

                                     FURGESON
                         No, Rita Miller. She just closed an 
                         account.

               Molly stares at Furgeson. She is not sure what to think.

                                     FURGESON
                              (continuing)
                         Is there a problem?

                                     MOLLY
                              (hesitating, not sure 
                              what to say)
                         No. I guess not. Thanks.

               She walks away, confused.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - DAY

               Carl, in front of his computer, is going crazy. He keeps 
               punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears 
               over and over on the screen. "RITA MILLER, #926-31043. ACCOUNT 
               CLOSED. BALANCE $00.00."

               Panicked, Carl jumps up. He moves quickly, erratically around 
               the office and then back to the computer. He punches the 
               keys over and over. The same answer appears on the screen. 
               The account is closed.

               HALL OUTSIDE CARL'S OFFICE

               Carl runs through the office. He seems crazed. People look 
               at him.

                                     LEEDEN
                         Carl, is something wrong?

                                     CARL
                         Is someone playing with the computers?

                                     LEEDEN
                         What?

                                     CARL
                         Is this a joke? One of my accounts 
                         is closed.

                                     LEEDEN
                         Which account? What's wrong?

               Carl freezes. He doesn't answer.

                                     LEEDEN
                              (continuing)
                         You want me to call someone?

                                     CARL
                              (changing his demeanor)
                         No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's 
                         all right. I can do it.

               EXT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY

               Sam and Oda Mae are walking down the street in front of the 
               bank. Oda Mae is talking to herself.

                                     ODA MAE
                         $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae. Take the check out of your 
                         purse.

               She stops. There is a nervous look on her face.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Take it out? Why?

                                     SAM
                         Just do it.

               Oda Mae, worried, removes the check but holds onto it tightly.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (in shock)
                         Endorse it? Why?

                                     SAM
                         Do what I say.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No!

                                     SAM
                         That's blood money, Oda. I was killed 
                         for that money. Endorse it now.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     SAM
                         We're giving it away.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Away? What do you mean? To who?

                                     SAM
                         Look to your left.

               Oda Mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless. 
               She recoils.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Are you outta your mind?

                                     SAM
                         Do what I tell you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         No!
                              (clutching the check)
                         I can't.

                                     SAM
                         Yes, you can. If you don't do it, 
                         they'll track you down. Your only 
                         protection is to get rid of it, now.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go 
                         to heaven for this.

               Oda Mae growls at him.

               With great difficulty, she approaches the nuns.

               The nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion.

                                     SAM
                         Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".

               With great hesitation, Oda Mae begins to write. We sense 
               that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert 
               their eyes from the check.

                                     NUN
                         Bless you, child.

               Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.

                                     SAM
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Don't you talk to me. I don't want 
                         you comin' round no more. I mean it. 
                         Understand?

                                     SAM
                         Come on, we're friends.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Friends? Friends?

               She turns on her high heels and wobbles away. Sam calls after 
               her.

                                     SAM
                         I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.

               She growls again. In the background we see the nuns secretly 
               peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead 
               away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an 
               attempt to revive her.

               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. 
               Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands 
               on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn.

               Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the 
               monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, 
               smiling.

                                     SAM
                         Search, you bastard! You'll never 
                         find it. It's gone.
                              (he smiles)
                         They'll kill you for this, Carl. You 
                         and Willie. They'll wipe you off the 
                         face of the earth.

               In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against 
               the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up 
               and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, 
               and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing 
               is working.

               Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and 
               storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, 
               hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The 
               computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the 
               computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. 
               Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it 
               back on again. Carl stares at it.

                                     CARL
                         What the...?

               Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and 
               letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, 
               mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. 
               The word "M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R" is emerging before him.

               Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to 
               see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Who's doing that?

               There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to 
               type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word 
               appears. "S-A-M".

               Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes 
               to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for 
               breath.

               Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying 
               scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his 
               ribs.

                                     SAM
                         You bastard! You goddamn bastard!

               Carl grabs his side.

                                     CARL
                         Ah!

               He hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain.

                                     SAM
                         It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you 
                         have a date with Molly, you creepy 
                         son-of-a bitch?

               Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles 
               over as though he's going to throw up.

                                     CARL
                         Jesus! Oh God!

               Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. 
               He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes 
               stark white as the attack continues.

               Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares 
               hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly 
               and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the 
               office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room.

               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT

               Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, 
               asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does 
               not look well. Sam is with him.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl? Where were you? I thought we 
                         were having...?

                                     CARL
                         I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. 
                         I completely forgot.

                                     SAM
                         Old Carl had a little trouble at the 
                         office.

                                     MOLLY
                         Forgot? I was worried. Is everything 
                         okay? Are you all right?

                                     CARL
                         I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I 
                         talk to you for minute? Can I come 
                         in?

               Molly eyes Carl with concern as he enters the loft.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I need to ask you a question.

                                     SAM
                         He needs to borrow four million 
                         dollars.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, I know what the police said, 
                         but when you thought Sam was here, 
                         when you thought he spoke to you, 
                         what did you feel? What did he say?

                                     MOLLY
                         Why? What happened?

                                     CARL
                              (very tense)
                         Molly, that psychic woman, I want to 
                         know what she told you. I want to 
                         know what she said.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. 
                         I told you. It wasn't real. She's a 
                         charlatan.
                              (she hesitates and 
                              stares at Carl)
                         Does this have anything to do with 
                         her being at the bank today?

                                     SAM
                         Oh shit!

                                     CARL
                              (gulping)
                         At the bank?

               Sam tenses. He holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop.

                                     MOLLY
                         I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says 
                         she was taking out money. It turns 
                         out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. 
                         It's Rita Miller or something.

               Carl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         What's wrong?

                                     CARL
                         Stomach. My stomach. Do you have 
                         anything? Pepto Bismol.

                                     MOLLY
                              (worried)
                         Sure. Just a second. What's going 
                         on?

               Concerned, she hurries from the room. Sam digs his hands 
               into Carl's back. Carl jerks forward in intense pain and 
               begins flailing at the air.

                                     CARL
                         What are you doing to me. Get away! 
                         Get away!

               INT. KITCHEN

               Sam does not go away. Freaked, Carl runs into the kitchen 
               and rushes to the stove. Quickly he turns on the gas. He 
               looks crazed. Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly.

                                     CARL
                         You touch me again and I'll set her 
                         on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her. 
                         I'll blow up the whole building if I 
                         have to. Stay away!

               Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off. 
               Carl sees it move. Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and 
               pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Go on, try it again. Let me see you 
                         turn it off now.

               Sam, frightened, tries with all his might but he cannot twist 
               it. Carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if 
                         you hurt me.

               Sam rushes at Carl about to jam his full fist into his chest, 
               but then he stops, afraid. He pulls back, shaken. Carl stands 
               there waiting for a blow that doesn't come. He begins to 
               gloat.

                                     CARL
                         What's a matter? You believe me, 
                         huh? You better believe me! I want 
                         my money. I need that money and I 
                         want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that 
                         psychic lady doesn't bring it here, 
                         Molly's dead.

               Sam freezes. Molly enters the kitchen. She grabs her nose.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh my God. Is that the gas?

               Carl acts as if that's the reason he came into the kitchen.

                                     CARL
                         You must have left the stove on.

               He fiddles with the dials and turns it off.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Just glad I smelled it.

                                     MOLLY
                              (confused)
                         Me, too.

               She opens a window.

                                     CARL
                         Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go. 
                         Look, there's something going on. I 
                         can't talk now. Some trouble at the 
                         bank.

                                     MOLLY
                         Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it 
                         that woman, the psychic?

                                     CARL
                         I don't have time to talk now. What 
                         if I come back? Around 11:00?

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, what's going on? Let me help 
                         you.

                                     CARL
                         I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but 
                         it's important. I'll be back.

               Molly is speechless.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Eleven!

               OMITTED

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Oda Mae is watching T.V. with Clara and Louise. Suddenly she 
               jumps, aware of Sam's presence in the room.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam!

               Clara and Louise jump, too.

                                     CLARA
                         Not again!

                                     ODA MAE
                         What're you doin' here?

                                     SAM
                         Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want 
                         the check. They're comin' to kill 
                         you. We gotta get outta here.

                                     ODA MAE
                         The check? What do you mean, "the 
                         check". You said they'd never find 
                         out.

                                     CLARA
                              (afraid)
                         What's happenin' Oda Mae?

               EXT. STREET

               A red Mustang SCREECHES to a stop on the street below. Sam 
               and Oda Mae run to the window. Carl and Willie are looking 
               up.

               INT. LIVINGROOM

                                     SAM
                         It's them.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're comin' to kill me.
                              (to Sam, crazed)
                         What have you done?

               EXT. ODA MAE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Willie and Carl jump out of the car. They head for Oda Mae's 
               building.

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Sam steps back from the window.

                                     SAM
                         They're heading for the door.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (terrified)
                         Jesus have mercy.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Willie forces open a back door. They head into the building.

               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and the others hurry into the hall. They rush down 
               the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbor's door. A WOMAN 
               opens it a crack.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Emergency! Let us in!

                                     WOMAN
                         Who you kiddin'?

               The Woman slams the door and locks it shut. Oda Mae looks 
               frightened.

               INT. APARTMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               Carl and Willie climb the stairs two at a time.

               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door. No 
               one is home. Across the corridor an ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her 
               head out to see what is going on. Before she can say anything 
               they push their way inside.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         What're you doin'? You can't come in 
                         here. The cat don't like visitors. 
                         She'll pee all over the couch. You 
                         wanna pay for...

               Oda Mae grabs the woman's mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - FISHEYE LENS VIEW

               just as Willie and Carl emerge from the stairwell. They head 
               down the hall toward Oda Mae's door. Willie pulls out a gun, 
               and fires. The lock shoots open. They rush inside.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               ODA MAE

               in the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the 
               peephole. The old woman is struggling and still trying to 
               talk. Oda Mae's knees are wobbling.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're gonna find us.

                                     SAM
                         No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that?

                                     SAM
                         Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I?

               INT. ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               Willie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun 
               pointed, ready to fire. He seems furious when he realizes no 
               one is there.

                                     WILLIE
                         Looks like someone just left.

                                     CARL
                         I'll check the building.

               ANGLE

               He rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the 
               apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over 
               and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, 
               he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, 
               he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway 
               is empty.

               As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam 
               steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie 
               nearly jumps out of his skin.

                                     WILLIE
                         Damn!

               He stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant, 
               a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and 
               crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked.

               Suddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the 
               STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie 
               spins around in total dismay.

               Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie 
               recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. 
               His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes 
               it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the 
               room. Sam laughs.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         Who's there? Who's doing that?

               ANGLE

               A pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly 
               hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie 
               runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot 
               water faucet turns on by itself.

               Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries 
               to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears 
               to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees.

                                     WILLIE
                         Oh God!

               There is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are 
               appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as 
               the word "B-O-O!" emerges before him. He cries out.

                                     WILLIE
                              (continuing)
                         Let me outta here!

               Shaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror. 
               Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs 
               hold of the door and yanks it open.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs 
               and stumbles down the three flights to the street. Carl, 
               running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops 
               his gun. Carl picks it up.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT

               Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk. 
               People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman. 
               Carl, confused, runs after him.

               Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away.

               Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over 
               him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up, 
               Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back 
               to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he 
               calls out to a bystander.

                                     WILLIE
                         Help me!

               People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands 
               exactly what is happening.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the 
               street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He 
               does not get out of their way.

               One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His 
               car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and 
               suddenly both cars crash right into him.

                                     CARL
                         Look out!

               Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles 
               as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and 
               writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as 
               they rush past. No one stops.

               Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the 
               street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body 
               lying there. He begins to scream.

               A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam 
               looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from 
               the shadows.

               With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down 
               and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are 
               dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the 
               sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.

               ANGLE

               Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing 
               in the crowd, turns and runs.

               INT. OLD LADY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in 
               the entryway to her apartment. They all appear frightened. 
               The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering 
               in the hall outside.

               Sam walks up to Oda Mae. She feels his presence.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam? What happened?

                                     SAM
                         He's dead, Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Dead!
                              (she utters a sigh of 
                              relief)
                         Oh, thank God. It's over.

                                     SAM
                         No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's 
                         still Carl.

               Oda Mae freezes. She turns to Sam.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Who's Carl?

               INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

               Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown.

                                     SAM
                         Tell him to hurry!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Can't you hurry up?

                                     DRIVER
                         Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I 
                         can.

               Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal. The cab shoots 
               forward. The driver seems shocked.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Problems?

               He gives her a dirty look.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               There is a KNOCK at the door. Molly goes to it. Fastening 
               the latch, she opens it a crack.

                                     MOLLY
                         Carl, is that you?

               Oda Mae wedges her foot inside.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you 
                         think of me, but your life is in 
                         danger. You have to listen to me. 
                         Sam's here, too. You gotta let us 
                         in.

               Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot.

                                     MOLLY
                         Get the hell out of here. I'm calling 
                         the police.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Go ahead. We want you to call 'em. 
                         You're in trouble. Let us in.

                                     MOLLY
                         No!

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam's death was no accident. He was 
                         murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering 
                         money at the bank. Sam found out. 
                         He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. 
                         He'll kill you, too.

                                     MOLLY
                              (screaming)
                         Why are you doing this to me? Get 
                         away from me! I know all about you. 
                         You're a fake. You're just a fake. 
                         Leave me alone!

               We see Sam's inside the room with Molly. He gazes at her 
               lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae.

                                     SAM
                         Tell her she's wearing the blouse I 
                         spilled the Margarita on and the 
                         earrings I gave her for Christmas.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Sam says you're wearin' the blouse 
                         he spilled the Margarita on and the 
                         earrings he gave you at Christmas.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               MOLLY

               grabbing hold of her beads. Her hand is shaking.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         See, I'm no fake.

                                     MOLLY
                         Go away!

                                     SAM
                         Gimme a penny quick.

                                     ODA MAE
                         What?

                                     SAM
                         Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.

               Oda Mae obeys. A pile of coins falls on the floor.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         Push a penny under the door.

               Oda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft. Molly sees 
               it. Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the 
               bottom of the door. Pushing gently, he moves the penny up 
               the door until it's eye level with Molly. She watches it, 
               amazed.

               Then, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the 
               door and hovers in the air. There is a look of wonder in 
               Molly's eyes as it floats toward her.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing; calling 
                              to Oda Mae)
                         Tell her it's for luck.

                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)
                         Sam says it's for luck.

               Molly stands there dumbfounded. Her face is completely white. 
               After a moment she reaches for the penny. It falls into her 
               hand. There are tears in her eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HALLWAY

               Oda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins 
               to open. Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares 
               at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly. She hesitates for a 
               long moment and then invites Oda Mae in.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Molly is on the phone. Oda Mae is beside her.

                                     MOLLY
                         Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. 
                         We're a red brick building with the 
                         entrance on the left side. Please 
                         hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be 
                         waiting right here.
                              (she hangs up)
                         Police are on their way.

               Oda Mae takes her and leads her to the couch.

                                     MOLLY
                         What do we do now?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Just wait.

               There is a period of awkward silence.

                                     MOLLY
                         Is Sam here?

                                     SAM
                         I'm sitting beside you.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (pointing)
                         Right here.

               Molly reaches out tentatively. Sam meets her hand. She 
               flinches for a second but does not pull back.

                                     MOLLY
                              (fingering the air)
                         Can you feel me, Sam?

                                     SAM
                         With all my heart.

                                     ODA MAE
                         With all his heart, he says.

                                     SAM
                         I'd give anything to be alive again, 
                         just to feel you once more.

                                     ODA MAE
                         He wishes he could touch you, just 
                         one more time.

                                     MOLLY
                         Oh, Sam.

               Oda Mae looks away uncomfortably. The CAMERA HOLDS on her 
               face. After a moment she turns around and addresses the air.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Okay, damn it, you can use me if you 
                         want.

               Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae.

                                     ODA MAE
                              (continuing)
                         Come on. Before I change my mind.

               Suddenly he understands what she means.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JUKEBOX

               Sam's finger presses down two keys. We see a record slide 
               out of its slot and move toward the turntable. We know what 
               it is going to play.

               ANGLE

               Oda Mae closes her eyes. "Unchained Melody" begins to play. 
               Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly 
               slides his ghostly body into her solid form. We sense Oda 
               Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside 
               her. After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly.

               Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures, 
               touches Molly's hand. Molly swallows hard. She closes her 
               eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               Sam. It is as though he alone is there with Molly. His eyes 
               are full of tears. He can barely move. His hand glides slowly 
               down Molly's cheek. He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and 
               pain.

               The experience is more than he can bear. He pulls back.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam!

               Molly reaches out, takes Sam's hand, and guides it to her 
               soft lips. Sam can barely breathe. He seems totally absorbed 
               in the experience, the sensation of human flesh.

               His eyes are absolutely still and full of light. He seems to 
               be glowing.

               Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet. 
               Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. 
               With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before 
               he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, 
               touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their 
               new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down 
               over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. 
               She stands motionless. Her face shines. She knows beyond all 
               doubt that it is him.

                                     MOLLY
                         I love you so much.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE

               A LOUD JARRING SOUND. It takes a moment to realize that it 
               is someone KNOCKING at the door. The light slams back into 
               its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his 
               ghostly form. Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center 
               of the room. Sam is beside them. He appears shaken and dizzy.

               There is a another loud POUNDING at the door.

                                     MOLLY
                         The police!

               Molly heads for the door. Sam calls out. He can barely speak.

                                     SAM
                         No!

                                     ODA MAE
                              (to Molly)
                         Wait!

               Sam tries to go instead. To his amazement and ours he is 
               extremely weak, barely able to move.

                                     SAM
                         What's happening to me?

               His ghostly functions are diminishing.

               There is another KNOCK and a voice rings out.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Molly, open up. It's me.

                                     MOLLY
                         It's Carl!

                                     SAM
                         Get out of here! The fire escape.

               Oda Mae grabs Molly.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Come with me.

               Oda Mae and Molly run for the fire escape window. We hear 
               Carl yelling in the hallway.

                                     CARL (O.S.)
                         Molly. Open up. Are you there?

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Carl is standing on the landing. He is holding a gun. He 
               aims it at the lock and FIRES. The door to the loft flies 
               open.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Carl moves rapidly through the huge space.

                                     CARL
                         Molly!

               It is obvious that no one's home.

               ANGLE

               Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with 
               his fists. To his great shock, he has no impact. Carl walks 
               right through him.

               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape.

               INT. LOFT - NIGHT

               Carl runs to the fire escape window. He looks out just in 
               time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window.

               INT. NEW LOFT - NIGHT

               Molly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under 
               construction. It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls. 
               The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them 
               half to death. They rush blindly toward the front door. It 
               won't open.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Back to the fire escape. Head for 
                         the roof.

               Oda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears 
               on the other side. She screams. Carl tries shoving the window 
               open. It won't budge.

               Molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. There 
               is an opening at the top.

                                     MOLLY
                         This way!

               Molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the 
               roof.

               With a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside. 
               The window slams behind him.

               Oda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a 
               loose cable and she falls to the ground.

                                     ODA MAE
                         Help us, Sam!

               OMITTED

               ODA MAE

               A hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl 
               is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the 
               floor.

                                     CARL
                         I want the check. Just give me the 
                         check.

               Molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream.

                                     MOLLY
                              (screaming)
                         God almighty, Carl! What are you 
                         doing? What have you done!?

               She descends quickly and runs toward Carl.

                                     CARL
                         Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's 
                         not her money.

               Carl kicks Oda Mae. Molly rushes at him, attacking him 
               violently. Carl aims his gun at her.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Keep out of this, Molly!

               He grabs Oda Mae by the hair.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Where is it?

               Oda Mae cries out.

                                     ODA MAE
                         In my purse.

                                     CARL
                         Where?

                                     ODA MAE
                         Over there.

               She points across the room.

               Carl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it. Yanking it 
               off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. There is 
               no check. He grabs Oda Mae.

                                     CARL
                         Where is it, goddamn it? Where is 
                         it?

                                     ODA MAE
                         I gave it away.

                                     CARL
                         You're lying! Don't lie to me!

               He aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when, 
               suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams 
               and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.

               In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS 
               his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for 
               cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his 
               strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs 
               Molly and aims his gun at her head.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll 
                         kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give 
                         me the check.

               The gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the 
               camera dollies toward Carl.

                                     CARL
                              (continuing)
                         Sam, please. I didn't mean for him 
                         to kill you. It's not my fault. Come 
                         on, Sam, give me the check. Give it 
                         to me and I'll leave her alone.

               Nothing happens. Carl looks nervous.

               ANGLE

                                     CARL
                         Sam? Sam?

               In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at 
               his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by 
               an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with 
               a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and 
               floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.

               Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the 
               floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the 
               door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.

               Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With 
               growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, 
               colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to 
               the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The 
               apartment looks like a scene from another world.

               Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from 
               Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he 
               scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot 
               see him.

               Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort, 
               he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. 
               Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing 
               the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns 
               and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get 
               to him in time.

               Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an 
               electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying 
               toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A 
               huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl 
               looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his 
               chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs 
               and slices into his heart. His body quivers.

               Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to 
               spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes 
               through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He 
               tries to breathe. There is no breath.

               ANGLE

               With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, 
               his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks 
               down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is 
               gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around 
               and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is 
               happening.

                                     CARL
                         Sam?

               There is a strange, silent moment between them.

               Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is 
               heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. 
               Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming 
               toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the 
               window sill.

               Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and 
               envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges 
               with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some 
               invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.

               And then it is silent. It is over.

               ANGLE

               Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly 
               against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is 
               filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we 
               see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible 
               longing.

               Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling 
               and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam 
               turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. 
               The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he 
               looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. 
               His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his 
               face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, 
               silent moment.

                                     SAM
                         Goodbye, Moll.

               Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.

                                     MOLLY
                         Sam? Is that you?

                                     SAM
                              (stunned)
                         Molly?!

                                     MOLLY
                         I hear you, Sam.

               She starts to cry.

               Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is 
               beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment, 
               Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.

                                     MOLLY
                              (continuing)
                         Oh God!

               Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed 
               by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another 
               without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a 
               silent exchange, charged with emotion.

               Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch, 
               the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous 
               image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him 
               as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.

                                     SAM
                         I can't stay anymore.

               Tears roll down her cheek.

               The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a 
               sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. 
               Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.

                                     ODA MAE
                         They're waiting for you, Sam.

                                     SAM
                              (smiling)
                         I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.
                              (with deep felt 
                              gratitude)
                         Thank you. Your mama would be proud.

               Oda Mae smiles warmly.

               Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining 
               moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.

                                     SAM
                         I love you, Molly. I've always loved 
                         you.

               Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.

                                     MOLLY
                         Ditto.

               The light inside Sam intensifies. A sweet smile emerges on 
               his lips.

                                     SAM
                         It's so amazing, Moll...

               His face fills with joy.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         The love inside.

               He whispers, almost crying.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         You take it with you.

               They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its 
               ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up 
               silently for a moment, her face filled with love.

                                     MOLLY
                         See ya.

               We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly 
               through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room 
               grows dark.

               Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and 
               wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to 
               help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently 
               takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they 
               walk quietly from the room.

                                         THE END

1	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - DAY
	SHOT - HELICOPTER'S POV - 

	Moving through clouds.  The clouds separate and, far below, we can
	see a giant outdoor amphitheatre.  There is no SOUND but the WIND.
	As we move closer to the amphitheatre, we can hear SNATCHES OF WORDS
	and PHRASES as though from a public address system.

2	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - PODIUM - DAY - SHOT OF BEN

	in cap and gown, standing in front of a microphone.  The WIND is
	BLOWING.  He has to hold on to the papers from which he is reading.

3	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF AUDIENCE - DAY

	Thousands of expressionless STUDENTS are sitting there.

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge
		that I shall endeavor to carry it
		with me forever.

5	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring at him impassively.

6	INTERCUT BETWEEN SHOTS

	of impassive students, seated, watching; of Ben standing
	alone on the huge amphitheatre stage; of CLOSEUPS of Ben
	speaking; of loudspeakers; of wind-blown papers on the
	podium.

7	EXT. PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
			(continuing)
		The purpose, my fellow graduates - 
		the purpose is -

	He stops, trying to think of the word.

8	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He begins to sweat.

9	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE

	watching.

10	SHOT - PODIUM of AMPHITHEATRE

	Ben's hands searching through the pages of his speech.
	The pages begin to blow away in the wind.

11	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE AUDIENCE - DAY

	staring.

12	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- there is a reason, my friends,
		and the reason is - 

13	CLOSEUP - BEN

	He is in a panic.  He looks up from his papers at the audience.

14	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	The audience is gone.

15	SHOT - PODIUM OF AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

				BEN
		- the reason is - the purpose is -

	SOUND of the WIND becoming the ROAR of an AIRCRAFT coming at
	us through the air.

16	SHOT - AMPHITHEATRE - DAY

	Huge and empty.  SOUND of AIRCRAFT.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE

		Ladies and gentlemen, we are about
		to begin our descent into Los Angeles -

	SOUND of a SONIC BOOM.

								CUT TO:

17	INT. PLANE - CLOSEUP - BEN - NIGHT

	His eyes open suddenly.

				CAPTAIN'S VOICE
		The sound you have just heard is the
		landing gear locking into place.  The
		Los Angeles weather is clear and the
		temperature is a pleasant 72.  We do
		not expect any traffic delay and will
		make our four hour and eighteen minute
		flight plan smack on the nose.  We
		enjoyed having you on board and look
		forward to seeing you again in the near
		future.

18	SHOT

	PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with
	snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the
	ceiling of the aircraft.  There is snow on all of them.

19	REVERSE ANGLE

	PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers
	staring straight ahead, their headsets on.  Ben turns and
	looks out the window.

20	EXT. LOS ANGELES - FROM THE AIR - NIGHT

	Los Angeles, at night, its lights stretching endlessly in every
	direction.

	SOUND - MUZAC and the STEWARDESS' LANDING SPEECH.

	START OF MAIN TITLES

	UNDER titles:

				STEWARDESS' VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen please fasten your
		seat belts in preparation for the landing
		and observe the no smoking sign.  After
		we land, you will notice an increase in
		the sound level as the thrust of the engines
		is reversed to help reduce forward speed.

21	INT. AIRPORT - MOVING SIDEWALK - NIGHT

	Ben and the other passengers on the automatic sidewalk.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Your attention, please!  American Airlines
		Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop
		to New York is now leaving from Gate
		Number 40.  All aboard, please.

28	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	His eyes are open and he is trying to remember something.
	There are the SOUNDS of many people TALKING and LAUGHING
	in other rooms.  A RADIO nearby PLAYS MUSIC.  After a
	while, there is the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING.  The SOUNDS
	of the people TALKING are lower.  MRS. TERHUNE'S voice
	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

				BEN
		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(as she passes the
			CAMERA)
		Wonderful party.

								CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

								CUT TO:

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in

	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped

				BEN

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

		What else?

		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward

		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for

	She straightens up.

				BEN

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the
		Robinsons' over for dinner on
		Thursday.

95	SHOT - BEN

	He slides off the raft and goes underwater.

96	SHOT - BEN UNDERWATER

	His hair streaming up, his eyes open.

							CUT TO:

97	INT. SPECIAL SET BRADDOCK DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

							CUT TO:

98	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben surfaces and pulls himself up on the side of the
	pool.

				BEN
		I'll go call Elaine now.

	Mr. and Mrs. Braddock cling exhausted to the raft and
	try to smile at each other.

	SOUND:  Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.

							CUT TO:

99	EXT. & INT. ROBINSON FRONT DOOR, HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

	The door opens.  Mr. Robinson stands there with a huge
	smile.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about
		time you got around to this.
		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I'll see if she's ready.

	Mr. Robinson exits.

100	SHOT - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

		about it, Benjamin.

	Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

				ELAINE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Well - I want you to keep your
		wits about you tonight.  You never
		know what tricks Ben picked up
		back there in the East.

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

								CUT TO:

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

								CUT TO:

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

				BEN
		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
	up.

	SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
	radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
	YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
	car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

118	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
	house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -
		we could do something - go
		somewhere else.

				ELAINE
		All right.

	He starts the car immediately and drives away from the

	Ben is driving.

				ELAINE
		Isn't there one in the Taft
		Hotel?

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if
		they have a bar or not.  I mean
		let's go see.  Let's go see if
		they do or not.

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside
	the door.  They start in a few steps.

				BEN
		Listen, Elaine - it seems to me

		I mean - as far as I know.

				ELAINE
		Of course there is.  Look -
		The Veranda Room - right there.

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

	CAMERS BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY.  A BELLBOY passes

				BELLBOY
		Hello, how are you, sir?

	The room clerk smiles at them.

				ROOM CLERK
		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the

	revealing many people moving back and forth in the
	lobby, passing Ben and Elaine.

				BEN
		I don't know.  They must think

	PAN WITH THEM as they start down the steps.  Coming up
	the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of
	another ELDERLY LADY.

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the
		first thing for so long that
		I've liked.  The first person
		I could stand to be with.

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a
		waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - are having an
		affair with someone?

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.  That is not my
		business.

				BEN
		It just happened.  It was just
		this thing that happened along
		with everything else.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		With a family?

				BEN
		Yes.  She had a husband and a

				ELAINE
		Did they ever find out?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		And it's all over now.

		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Okay.

				BEN
		You sure you really want to?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	SHOT - INT. BEN'S CAR - BEN DRIVING

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
		with Elaine.  We're going for
		a drive.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at him
			for the first time)
		Do exactly what I say.

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

	As they drive.

				BEN
		Now it seems to me -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Listen to me very carefully,
		Benjamin.  You are not to see
		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then you'd better start believing me.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
	door.

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

127	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

		Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

	Ben turns and looks.

128	SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

				BEN
		NO.

	He turns around.

129	NEW ANGLE

	Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
	still holds the shoe in her hand.

				BEN
		Why aren't you ready?

				ELAINE
		Because I want to know what's
		happening.

	SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

				BEN
		There isn't time!

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you
		something.

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				BEN
		That woman -

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

				BEN
		Yes.  The married woman - it
		wasn't just some woman -

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
	hall.

				ELAINE
		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.
			(holds the package
			out to her)

				ELAINE
		Get out of here.

	She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
	the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

		Get out!

	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.

		Say that again.

		I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

	MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Well - well - well -

	He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand
	to shake it.  Mrs. Braddock appears in the doorway.  Ben
	is shaking his father's hand.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What's happening?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben says he and Elaine are getting

		No.  I think you'll want to wait

		They don't know?

				BEN
		No - they don't.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well - when did you decide all
		this?

				BEN
		About an hour ago.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Wait a minute.  You talked to
		Elaine this morning?

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're
		coming up to Berkeley?

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

166	SHOT - BEN

	He looks at the massed group moving toward him, horror
	taking over his face.  He starts forward.  As he passes
	Elaine and her friends he seems to take a deep breath and
	hold it.

	She stops and slowly turns to look in his direction.  Her
	companions also stop.  Ben changes his direction and
	makes a circle to his left as though he has just changed
	his mind.  He looks at her.  He does not stop walking.
	He makes a slow circle around her as he speaks.

				BEN
		Elaine.  Hey - what a surprise.
			(not quite looking
			at her)
		Say - I thought I remembered that
		you were going to school up here
		- well - we'll have to get together
		sometime - I'll be up here myself
		for a little while.

167	SHOT - BEN'S POV

	Elaine and the others staring at him.

168	SHOT - BEN

				BEN
		- it certainly has been nice -
		I think I'm late - yes, I am -

	He turns and walks away from them.  They stand still
	watching them go.  He starts to walk faster and faster.
	They watch him as he gets further and further away and
	then breaks into a run.  He disappears in the distance.

	SOUND:  Footsteps running, a door opening and closing,
	footsteps running upstairs, a door opening and slamming.

171	INT. TELEGRAPH STREET RESTAURANT - DAY

	Ben is sitting at a table by the window through which
	we can see the street.  He is drinking a beer.  Other
	tables are filled with students having animated discussions.
	Ben starts to pour some beer from the bottle into the
	glass.  He stops as he sees something through the window.
	He leans forward.

	Elaine comes out of a bookstore across the street.  She
	crosses the street and moves to a bus stop.  He stands,
	fumbles in his pocket for money, puts a dollar on the
	table and rushes out.

172	EXT. RESTAURANT TELEGRAPH STREET - DAY

	Ben comes out of the door just as Elaine gets into a bus
	and the doors close behind her.

	The bus starts off.  Ben runs after it.  The bus gets to
	the next corner and stops for a red light.  Ben catches
	up with it, runs to the front door and knocks on the
	door.  The door opens and he climbs in.

174	INT. BUS NO. 1 - DAY - SHOT ELAINE

	She is seated next to an OLDER LADY by the window immediately
	in front of the rear exit door.  She keeps looking out
	the window, almost holding her breath as she hears:

				BEN'S VOICE
			(getting closer as
			he moves past people
			toward her)
		Excuse me - I'm sorry - I
		wonder if I could get by -
		excuse me -

	There is a pause and then, immediately behind her:

				BEN'S VOICE
			(cheerfully)
		Well - how about this for a
		coincidence.

175	NEW ANGLE

	Ben's face is right behind Elaine, between her and the older
	lady sitting next to her.  Ben is standing on the steps
	to the rear exit door.  Elaine continues to look out the
	window.

				BEN
			(leaning in a little)
		I was wondering where you were
		headed.

	Elaine doesn't answer.  The lady sitting next to Elaine
	takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben,
	then looks at Elaine again.

				ELAINE
		I'm meeting someone.

				BEN
		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Where are you meeting this person?

				ELAINE
		At the Zoo.

				BEN
		The Zoo.  They have a pretty good
		one here, do they?

				ELAINE
		I've never been to it.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I haven't either.  I
		might just ride out there with you.

	Hold on them riding.

							CUT TO:

176	EXT. ZOO - DAY

	Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the
	outside animal cages.  Ben is walking a step or two behind
	Elaine.  He is darting glances to the right and left.

				BEN
		Is that him over there?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going
		to meet you?

				ELAINE
		I thought he said by the monkey
		house.

				BEN
		Oh.

	She stops.  Ben stops.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I would like to know
		what you're doing here.

				BEN
		Here?  In Berkelely?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

				ELAINE
		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't
		seem to mind.  They've been
		very congenial about it.

	She looks at him and starts to shake her head.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - you're - I don't
		know what to say - you're --

				BEN
		Maybe we could get together
		some time and talk about it.

				ELAINE
		- really incredible -

				BEN
		Here he comes.

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

				BEN
		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	front door below.

	BEN

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

				BEN
		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens
	it.  Elaine is standing in the hall.

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

				BEN
		Come in.

				ELAINE
		No.  I want to know why you're
		here in Berkeley?

				BEN
		Because - I am.

				ELAINE
		Is it because I'm here?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				ELAINE
		I think it is.

	Ben nods.

				ELAINE
		I said I think it is.

				BEN
		All right then!  Yes!

				ELAINE
		Well, I want you to leave.

				BEN
		Elaine - I love you.

				ELAINE
			(looking down)
		How could you do that, Benjamin?

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

	SOUND:  A KNOCK on the door.

				MR. McCLEERY'S VOICE
		What's going on in there?

	Elaine sits up and drinks the water.  Ben looks at
	her then goes to the door and opens it.

				BEN
		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

				MR. McCLEERY
		Screaming isn't all right.  Not
		in my house it isn't.

				BEN
		It was just a visitor.  But it's
		all right now.

	Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see
	into the room.  Ben edges through the door into the
	hallway.

184	INT. ROOMING HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

				MR. McCLEERY
		What did you do to her?

				BEN
		Look - she's all right.  She's
		upset and she screamed.  But
		she's okay now.

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,
		Braddock?

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				BEN
		Mr. McCleery?

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

				MR. McCLEERY
			(going down the
			stairs)
		Because I don't like you.

	Mr. McCleery disappears down the stairs.  Ben turns and
	goes back into the room.

185	INT. ROOMING HOUSE - BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Elaine is standing at the sink.  She is putting water on
	her face.  Ben goes to the closet and takes out his suit-
	case and carries it to the bed.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the
	suitcase.

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to
	the bureau and puts it back in the drawer, takes some
	ties from the drawer and crosses to the suitcase.  Elaine
	gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

				BEN
		I don't understand.

				ELAINE
		I don't want you to go anywhere
		until you have a definite plan.

				BEN
		But Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Goodbye.

	She walks out, shutting the door behind her.  He crosses
	to the window.

	He gets out of the bed.

		Benjamin?

				BEN

		Will you kiss me!

	He goes to her and they kiss.

				BEN
		Will you marry me?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		You won't?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		But you might.

				ELAINE
		I might.

				BEN
		Is that so?  You might marry me?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		When?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

				BEN
		How about tomorrow?  I don't mean
		to be pushy but -

				ELAINE
		I don't know.  I don't know what's
		happening.

				BEN
		You mean you're confused?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well - look - don't be confused.
		We're getting married.

				ELAINE
		I don't see how we can.

				BEN
		We just can.

				ELAINE
		I have to go back now.

	She goes to the door.

				BEN
		Elaine - are you serious about this?

				ELAINE
		I'll think about it.

				BEN
		You really will?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

	She opens the door and steps into the hall.  He goes to the

		Do you want - do you want to try

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

4	EXT. AMPHITHEATRE - SHOT OF PODIUM - DAY

				BEN
		- and today it is right that we
		should ask ourselves the one most
		important question: What is the
		purpose of these years, the purpose
		for all this demanding work,
		the purpose for the sacrifices
		made those who love us?  Were
		there NOT a purpose, then all of
		these past years of struggle, of
		fierce competition and of uncom-
		promising ambition would be mean-
		ingless.  But, of course, there
		is a purpose and I must tell it
		to you.  I ask you to remember
		this purpose always and I pledge

	can be heard among them.

				MRS. TERHUNE'S VOICE

		-- associate editor of the college
		newspaper in his junior year - 
		managing editor in his senior
		year -

	The SOUND of the DOOR CLOSING.  Mrs. Terhune's VOICE and
	the VOICES of the other guests FADE DOWN.  Mrs. Terhune's
	VOICE can be HEARD with varying clarity through the
	remainder of the sequence.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of a LIGHT SWITCH
	being SNAPPED and light, as though from an overhead fixture,
	falls across BEN's face.  He does not move.

	After a few moments, there is the SOUND of the RADIO being
	SNAPPED OFF.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What's the matter?

	Ben's mouth opens a little bit and closes again.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		The guests are all downstairs,
		Ben.  They're all waiting to see you.

				BEN
		Look, Dad - could you explain to
		them that I have to be alone for
		a while?

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		These are all our good friends,
		Ben.  Most of them have known you
		since - well - practically since
		you were born.

	Ben has not moved.  Now the bed on which he is lying moves
	as though someone has sat down upon it next to him.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		What is it, Ben?

	The CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK SLOWLY.

				BEN
		I'm just - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- worried?

				BEN
		Well - 

				MR. BRADDOCK
		About what?

				Ben
		I guess - about my future.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		What about it?

				BEN
		I don't know.  I want it to be -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		To be what?

				BEN
			(quietly)
		Different.

	As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and
	MRS. BRADDOCK looks in.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Is anything wrong?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		No!  No - we're just on our way
		downstairs!

	Mr. Braddock gets off the bed and goes to a chair and
	picks up Ben's jacket which is lying across it.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Carlsons' are here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to Mrs. Braddock)
		They are?
			(to Ben)
		Come on.

	Mr. Braddock puts the jacket on Ben.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They came all the way from
		Tarzana.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		It's a wonderful thing to have
		so many devoted friends.

	They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben.

29	INT. HALLS AND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the
	Braddocks are moving down.

				MR. CARLSON
		Hey - there's our award winning
		scholar.

				MRS. CARLSON
		We're all very proud of you,
		Ben.

				BEN
		Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

				MR. CARLSON
		Is that the new car out there?
		The little red Wop job?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That's Ben's graduation present.

				MR. CARLSON
			(putting his arm
			across Ben's shoulder)
		Won't have much trouble picking
		them up in that, will you?

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. CARLSON
		The girls.  The chicks.  The -
		the teeny boppers.

				MRS. CARLSON
		I think Ben has gotten beyond
		the teeny bopper stage - haven't
		you, Ben?

	Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink.  Ben tries to smile
	and return the wink politely.

				BEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs.

				BEN
		Excuse me - I think I'd just
		like to check something on
		the car for a minute -

	Ben moves to the front door and opens it.  MR. LOOMIS
	steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Here's the track star himself.
		How are you, track star?

				BEN
		Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

	Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the
	hall.

				MR. LOOMIS
		I want to get a drink and then
		I want to hear all about that
		thing you won.  That Hopperman
		award.

				BEN
		Helpingham.

				MR. LOOMIS
		Helpingham!  Right!  Now you
		wait right here.

	Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room.  Ben
	moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of
	the living room.  One lady takes Ben's right hand, another
	lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket.

				LADY 1
		Ben - we're all so proud of
		you.

				LADY 2
		Proud, proud, proud, proud,
		proud.

				LADY 3
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I was going to go upstairs for a
		minute -

				LADY 3
		No - I meant with your future.

				LADY 2
		With your life.

				BEN
		Well - that's a little hard to say -

	MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben!

				Ben
			(to the ladies)
		Excuse me.
			(he turns around)
		Mr. McQuire

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(overwhelmed with pride)
		Ben.

				BEN
		Mr. McQuire.

	Mr. McQuire takes Ben's arm and steers him down the hall
	toward the back of the house and out through the back door.

30	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	The pool is eerily lit.  There are FOUR PEOPLE standing and
	TALKING, drinks in their hands, at the back of the yard.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Ben - I just want to say one word to
		you - just one word -

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Are you listening?

				BEN
		Yes I am.

				MR. MCQUIRE
			(gravely)
		Plastics.

	They look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Exactly how do you mean?

				MR. MCQUIRE
		There is a great future in plastics.
		Think about it.  Will you think
		about it?

				BEN
		Yes, I will.

				MR. MCQUIRE
		Okay.  Enough said.  That's a deal.

	Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house.  The
	people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben.

				WOMAN #1
		Here he is now.  Here's Ben.

				BEN
		Excuse me just a minute -

	Ben goes into the house through the back door.

31	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - NIGHT

	We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his
	way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he
	goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room.

	SOUND of a door SLAMMING.

32	INT. - EXT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben stands with his back against the door.  The SOUNDS of the
	PARTY downstairs and, as Ben walks across the room to a
	window, the SOUND of the WIND.

32A	SHOT - LONG SHOT (Location)

	Over Ben to pool area and people below.  SOUND of the door
	OPENING.  Ben turns.  MRS. ROBINSON enters the room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh.  I guess this isn't the
		bathroom, is it?

				BEN
		It's down the hall.

	They stand for a moment, loocking at each other.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you, Benjamin?

				BEN
		Fine, thank you.  The bathroom is
		down at the end of the hall.

	Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge
	of the bed.

				BEN
		Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't
		mean to be rude but -

	Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and
	lights it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is there an ashtray in here?

				BEN
		No.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh - I forgot.  The track star
		doesn't smoke.

	She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on
	the bedspread.  Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over
	to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the
	wastebasket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it a girl?

				BEN
		Is what a girl?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Whatever it is you're upset
		about.

				BEN
		Oh - no.  I'm just sort of
		disturbed about things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In general.

				BEN
		That's right.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to ask you
		something.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you take me home?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband took the car.  Will
		you drive me home?

	Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson
	a set of car keys.

				BEN
		Here - you take it.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him.

				BEN
		Do you know how to work a
		foreign shift?

	Mrs. Robinson shakes her head.

				BEN
		You don't?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.
			(there is a pause)

				BEN
		Let's go.

	She throws the keys to him.  He catches them.

								CUT TO:

33	EXT. BRADDOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING THROUGH THE OPEN FRONT DOOR.  Mr. Braddock is
	talking to the Terhunes at the door.  Ben and Mrs.
	Robinson come down the hall.

				BEN
		Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride
		home.  I'll be right back.

	Mr. Braddock pats Ben on the shoulder.  Mrs. Robinson
	is walking ahead through the front door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(as she passes the
			CAMERA)
		Wonderful party.

								CUT TO:

34	OMITTED

35	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car comes to a stop in the Robinson driveway.  They sit
	for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	She doesn't move.  Ben gets out and goes around to her side
	and opens the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you come in, please?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want you to come in till I get
		the lights on.

				BEN
		What for?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't feel safe until
		I get the lights on.

	They move to the door.  She takes out her key and opens
	the door.

36	INT. ROBINSON HALL AND SUNROOM - NIGHT

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you mind walking ahead of
		me to the sun porch.  I feel
		funny about coming into a dark
		house.

				BEN
		But it's light in there now.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please.

	Ben turns and walks down the hall.  They enter sunroom.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?  Bourbon?

				BEN
		Look - I drove you home.  I was
		glad to do it.  But I have some
		things on my mind.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		All right then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you drink?

	He looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this
		way, but I don't want to be
		alone in this house.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Please wait till my husband
		gets home.

				BEN
		When is he coming back?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't know.

	She pours herself a drink.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drink?

				BEN
		No.

	She hands him a drink.  There is a pause.

				BEN
		Are you always this much afraid
		of being alone?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, why can't you just lock
		the doors and go to bed?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'm very nuerotic.

	She turns on the phonograph.  SOUND of PHONOGRAPH.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I ask you a question?

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What do you think of me?

				BEN
		What do you mean?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You've known me nearly all of
		your life.  You must have
		formed some opinion.

				BEN
		Well - I've always thought
		that you were a very - nice -
		person.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know I was an alcoholic?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you know that?

				BEN
		Look - I think I should be
		going -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - if you don't
		mind my saying so - this
		conversation is getting a
		little strange.  Now I'm sure
		that Mr. Robinson will be here
		any minute and -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		My husband will be back quite
		late.

	They look at each other.  Ben is half standing.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He should be gone for several
		hours.

	She takes a step toward him.  He puts his hand up and
	retreats around the other side of the chair.

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Pardon?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What's wrong?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
		I mean you didn't expect -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean - you didn't really
		think that I would do something
		like that.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Like what?

				BEN
		What do you think?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I don't know.

				BEN
		For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson,
		here we are, you've got me into
		your house.  You give me a
		drink.  You put on music, now
		you start opening up your
		personal life to me and tell
		me your husband won't be home
		for hours.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		So?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - you are trying
		to seduce me.

	There is a pause.  She looks at him.

				BEN
			(weaker)
		Aren't you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why no.  I hadn't thought of it.
		I feel rather flattered that
		you -

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
		me for what I just said?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's all right.

				BEN
		It's not all right, it's the
		worst thing I've ever said
		to anyone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Sit down.

				BEN
		Please forgive me.  Because I
		like you.  I don't think of you
		that way.  But I'm mixed up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now finish your drink.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
		that I said that to you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'll forget it right now.
		Finish your drink.

				BEN
		What is wrong with me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you ever seen Elaine's
		portrait?

				BEN
		Her portrait?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We had it done last Christmas.
		Would you like to see it?

				BEN
		Very much.

	We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom,
	into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to
	the doorway to Elaine's room.

37	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait.

				BEN
		Elaine certainly is an
		attractive girl, isn't she?

	In the b.g. Mrs. Robinson watches him.

				BEN
			(looking at the
			portrait)
		I don't remember her as having
		brown eyes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you unzip my dress?

	He steps back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I think I'll go to bed.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, goodnight.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Won't you unzip my dress?

				BEN
		I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you still think I'm trying
		to seduce you -

				BEN
		No, I don't.  But I just feel
		a little funny.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - you've known me all
		your life.

				BEN
		I know that.  But I'm -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Come on.

	She turns her back.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's hard for me to reach.

	Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Right.

	Ben walks toward the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What are you so scared of?

				BEN
		I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then why do you keep running
		away?

				BEN
		Because you're going to bed.  I
		don't think I should be up here.

	Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Haven't you ever seen anybody
		in a slip before?

				BEN
		Yes, I have -

	He looks up at the portrait of Elaine.

				BEN
		But I just - Look - what if Mr.
		Robinson walked in right now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What if he did?

				BEN
		Well, it would look pretty
		funny, wouldn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you think he trusts us
		together?

				BEN
		Of course he does.  But he
		might get the wrong idea.
		Anyone might.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't see why.  I'm twice as
		old as you are.  How could
		anyone think -

				BEN
		But they would!  Don't you see?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I'm not trying to
		seduce you.  I wish you'd -

				BEN
		I know that.  But please, Mrs.
		Robinson.  This is difficult
		for me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why is it?

				BEN
		Because I am confused about
		things.  I can't tell what
		I'm imagining.  I can't tell
		what's real.  I can't -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would you like me to seduce you?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is that what you're trying to
		tell me?

				BEN
		I'm going home now.  I apologize
		for what I said.  I hope you can
		forget it.  But I'm going home
		right now.

	Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall.  The
	CAMERA PUSHES with him to the door.  We see the entire
	stairway and part of the downstairs hall.  Ben gets to
	the stairs and starts down.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		BENJAMIN?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring up my purse before
		you go?

				BEN
		I have to go now.  I'm sorry.

	Mrs. Robinson walks into the hall.  Her back is to us.
	She is holding her dress in front of her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I really don't want to put this
		on again.  Won't you bring it
		up?

				BEN
		Where is it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On that chair in the hall.

	She walks out of the shot.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BEN
		Well here's the purse.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Could you bring it up?

				BEN
		Well I'll hand it to you.

	Ben starts back up the stairs.

				BEN
		Come to the railing and I'll
		hand it up.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin - I am getting pretty
		tired of all this suspicion.
		Now if you won't do me a simple
		favor I don't know what.

	Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs.

				BEN
		I'm putting it on the top step.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		For God's sake, Benjamin, will
		you stop acting that way and
		bring me the purse?

	Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly
	down the hall.

				BEN
		I'm putting it here by the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Will you bring it in to me?

				BEN
		I'd rather not.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		All right.  Put it in the room
		where we were.

				BEN
		Right.

38	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the
	bed and puts the purse down.  As he starts to turn
	back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a
	movement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He
	turns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the
	door to the bedroom behind her.

				BEN
		Oh God.

	She smiles.

				BEN
		Let me out.

	She turns the lock on the door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't be nervous.

				BEN
		Get away from that door.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I want to say something first.

				BEN
		Jesus Christ!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - I want you to know
		I'm available to you.  If you
		won't sleep with me this time -

				BEN
		Oh my God.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you won't sleep with me this
		time, Benjamin, I want you to
		know you can call me up any
		time you want and we'll make
		some kind of arrangement.

				BEN
		Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand what I said?

				BEN
		Yes.  Yes.  Let me out!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I find you very attractive
		and any time -

	There is the SOUND of a CAR in the driveway outside.
	Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside,
	struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into
	the hall and down the stairs.

39	INT. SUNROOM - NIGHT

	Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down.  SOUND of
	FOOTSTEPS on the driveway outside.  Ben jumps up, gets
	the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again.
	SOUND of the front door OPENING and CLOSING.

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Is that Ben's car in front?

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		Yes, sir!

	FOOTSTEPS approach the sunroom.  MR. ROBINSON enters.

				BEN
		I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson
		home.  She wanted me to drive
		her home so I - I drove her home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Swell.  I appreciate it.

				BEN
		She's upstairs.  She wanted me
		to wait down here till you got
		home.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Standing guard over the old
		castle, are you?

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

	Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Here.  It looks like you need
		a refill.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I've got to go.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is anything wrong?  You look
		a little shaken up.

				BEN
		No.  No - I'm just - I'm just
		a little worried about my
		future.  I'm a little upset
		about my future.

	Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Come on.  Let's have a nightcap
		together.

	Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks.
	Ben takes several deep breaths, straightens his tie
	and checks to see if his fly is okay.  Mr. Robinson
	turns and brings him the drink.

				BEN
		Thank you very much, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - how old are you now?

				BEN
		Twenty.  I'll be twenty-one
		next week.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(taking out a
			cigarette)
		That's a hell of a good age
		to be.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I wish I was that age again.
		Because, Ben -

				BEN
		Sir?

				MR. ROBINSON
		You'll never be young again.

				BEN
		I know.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, can I say something to
		you?

				BEN
		What?

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have we known each
		other now?

	Ben shakes his head.

				MR. ROBINSON
		How long have you and I known
		each other?  How long have
		your Dad and I been partners?

				BEN
		Quite a while.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I've watched you grow up, Ben.

				BEN
		Yes, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		In many ways I feel as though
		you were my own son.

				BEN
		Thank you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		So I hope you won't mind my
		giving you a friendly piece
		of advice.

				BEN
		I'd like to hear it.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I think - I think you
		ought to be taking it a little
		easier right now than you seem
		to.

	Ben nods.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Sow a few wild oats.  Take things
		as they come.  Have a good time
		with the girls and so forth.

	Mrs. Robinson enters the room.  She is now wearing the
	dress she wore earlier.  Ben starts to get up.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't get up.

	Ben sits.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I was just telling Ben here he
		ought to sow a few wild oats.
		Have a good time while he can.
		You think that's sound advice?

	Mrs. Robinson nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I do.

				BEN
		I've got to go.

	He stands.  Mr. Robinson stands up with him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You have yourself a few flings
		this summer.  I bet you're
		quite a ladies' man.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What?  You look like the kind
		of guy that has to fight them
		off.
			(to Mrs. Robinson)
		Doesn't he look to you like
		the kind of guy who has to
		fight them off?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, he does.

	They start out of the sunroom.

40	INT. ROBINSON HALL - NIGHT

				MR. ROBINSON
		Oh say - Elaine gets down from
		Berkeley on Saturday.

				BEN
		Oh yes.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben - I want you to give her a
		call.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Great.

	Mr. Robinson opens the front door and Ben goes out.

41	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	SHOOTING OVER THE CAR toward the house.  Ben comes toward
	the car.  Mrs. Robinson appears in the doorway; the light
	behind her makes it difficult to see her face.
				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Yes.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you for taking me home.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll see you soon, I hope.

	Ben continues to walk toward us.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ladies and gentlemen - your
		attention, please - for this after-
		noon's feature attraction.

42	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The sun shines brightly.  Standing and sitting around
	the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends MR.
	and MRS. ARNOLD, and the Arnold children, PETER and
	LOUISE, who are eight or nine.  Watching from across the
	fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next
	door and her boy friend.  Across the fence on the other
	side of the house: a quartet of adults, formally dressed
	as though for a cocktail party, holding drinks and watch-
	ing.  One of them holds a baby.  The Braddocks, the
	Arnolds and their children are dressed in California
	Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely
	too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too
	old for them.

	Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the
	house.  The others are grouped, more or less, at the other
	end.  Mr. Braddock is hamming it up.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Hey, over there -- I mean you!
		Your attention please!

	Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the
	house, the window into the kitchen.  He speaks quickly -
	in a fake sotto voce - towards the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Are you ready in there, feature
		attraction?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Could I speak to you for a second,
		Dad?

	But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window
	and is readdressing his audience.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- what was I saying?

				MRS. ARNOLD
		Feature attraction.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Right.  Hey - I'm glad to see
		you're paying attention.  A
		feature attraction that will be
		one of the most astounding
		events ever to take place in
		this particular backyard.

	They all laugh and some applaud.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Now I'm going to ask for a big
		round of applause to bring this
		boy out here - wait a minute -
		let me amend that - to bring
		this young man out here - because
		today he is twenty-one-years-
		old -

				MR. ARNOLD
			(his hands like
			a megaphone)
		Let's get on with the show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Just hang on a minute because
		I have a few words to say -

				MR. ARNOLD
		You always do.

	They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as
	he grinningly acknowledges the reponse to his snappy
	comeback.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - could we just talk about
		this for a second?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Twenty-one-years-old, ladies
		and gentlemen; four of those
		years spent accomplishing some
		rather extraordinary things at
		one of our nation's leading
		seats of learning -

				MR. ARNOLD
		Bring him out!

				PETER AND LOUISE
		On with the show!  On with the
		show!

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to the window)
		I can't hold them much longer,
		Ben.  You better get out here.

				BEN'S VOICE
		I'd like to discuss this.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(to his audience)
		This boy - I'm sorry - this
		young man - is soon to continue
		his education as a Frank Halping-
		ham Award Scholar - but before
		he does -

	Mr. Braddock darts back to the window.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- before he does -
			(to the window)
		You're disappointing them, Ben.
		You're disappointing them.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Dad - can you listen -

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(meaning it)
		I'll give you ten seconds.
			(back to the
			people)
		He is going to give us a
		practical demonstration of
		what I feel safe in saying is
		a pretty exciting birthday
		present - and it better work
		or I'm out over two hundred
		bucks - so let's hear it for -

	Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open.
	It slams against the wall inside.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		- Benjamin Braddock!

44	INT. BRADDOCK BREAKFAST KITCHEN - SHOT DOWN THE HALL - DAY

	At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben,
	dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers
	on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the
	mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling.
	He holds a spear gun in his hand.

	The people applaud.

45	EXT BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - FROM BEN'S POV

	The people in the backyard.  His father stands just
	outside the screen door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Folks - this remarkable young
		man is going to perform for you
		some spectacular and amazing
		feats of daring in water that is
		over six feet deep -

	Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down.

	We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD
	down the hall.  Everything is slightly distorted through
	the glass.  Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing
	apparatus in it.

	SOUND: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
	SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
	applauding and chattering noiselessly.

	We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool.  Mr. Braddock
	is running back and forth, clapping his hands and
	delivering his now soundless pitch.

	We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
	pool.  Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool,
	motioning toward us to come down to the deep end.  He
	joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool.  They both
	begin to motion us toward them.

	We get to the deep end of the pool.  Mr. Braddock signals
	us with his hand to go under.  He kneels down by the edge
	of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
	under.  He has a big smile.

	We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look.  The
	figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
	of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling;
	the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their
	fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding
	encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees,
	smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
	under.  We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool.

46	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	OVERHEAD SHOT (HELICOPTER POV)

	Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at
	the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking
	down into it.

	PULL UP AND UP AND UP

	Until there are thirty houses below us, with its owners,
	swimming, playing, eating, cooking, reading, dancing,
	sunbathing, constructing and gardening around thirty pools.
	SOUND of Ben's BREATHING APPARATUS, fading into the SOUND
	of the WIND.

	Hold for a few seconds, then:

	SOUND of a dime DROPPING into a pay phone and DIALING.

								DISSOLVE TO:

47	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - BEN

	In a phone booth.  The booth is in the entrance area of
	the hotel between the lobby and the driveway.  Ben holds
	the receiver to his ear.  SOUND of PHONE RINGING.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I don't quite
		know how to put this -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		Look - I was thinking about that
		time after the party -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		- and I was wondering if I could
		buy you a drink or something -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Where are you?

				BEN
		Uh - The Taft Hotel.

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Did you get a room?

				BEN
		No.  Now I know it's pretty
		late and if you'd rather -

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Give me an hour.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		I'll be there in an hour.

	SOUND of her HANGING UP.  Ben hangs up slowly.
	He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about
	uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and
	carrying it folded across his arm in front of him,
	leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that
	lead to the main lobby.  As he is about to go in, the
	doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming
	out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering
	to each other and helping each other out of the door and
	down the steps.  Ben holds one of the doors open for them
	and stands politely to one side.  As they get through,
	Ben starts to move inside.  At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG
	PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push
	him to one side and move past him into the lobby.  He
	moves back against the other door, holding it open and
	allowing them to go in first.  He smiles politely and they
	pay no attention to him at all.  He follows them into the
	lobby.  They move toward the front desk and he moves with
	them.  One of the boys at the front of the group leans in
	and says something to the CLERK behind the desk.

	The clerk points across the lobby and says something to
	him.  There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some-
	where.  The group of young people passes by the desk
	and Ben moves in behind them.  He pauses at the desk and
	looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against
	the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the
	keys dangling suggestively.

				ROOM CLERK
		Can I help you, sir!

				BEN
		What?  Oh - no - I'm just -

	He points vaguely in the direction of the other young
	people.

				ROOM CLERK
		Are you here for an affair,
		sir?

	Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes.  He looks
	helplessly at the clerk.

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		The Singleman party, sir?

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.

				ROOM CLERK
		It's in the main ballroom.

				BEN
		Ahh - thank you.

	Ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby.
	He puts on his jacket as he goes.  He gets to the entrance
	to the main ballroom.  He pauses at the door, looks in.

	What he sees:  People dancing, talking, sitting, etc.
	He turns back toward te lobby.  He stops.

	What he sees:  The room clerk scross the lobby watching
	him.

	Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom
	as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman
	affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.

48	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	As Ben steps inside.

				VOICE
		Hello.

	Ben turns.  Four people stand in a row.  Official greeters,
	they are:  A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, AN OLDER MAN, AN ELDERLY
	LADY AND A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD BOY, dressed formally and they
	are smiling with great determination.

				BEN
		Hello.

	It is the older lady who has said hello.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		You must be one of the Porters.

	She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm not -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'd like you to know my sister,
		Miss DeWitte -

	MISS DEWITTE, who, from the looks of things, always has
	been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand.

				MISS DeWITTE
		How do you do?

				BEN
		How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

	Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's
	hand.

				BEN
			(apologetically)
		Oh - sorry -

				JEFFREY SINGLEMAN
		Fine, thank you.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		That's Jeffrey, of course.

	Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand.

				BEN
		Of course.

				MR. SINGLEMAN
		I didn't get your name, sir.

				BEN
		Benjamin Braddock, sir.

	Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been
	holding.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Braddock - Braddock?

				BEN
		Yes, but I'm afraid -

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'll find your table in a moment.
		Braddock.  Not Braniff?  We have
		a Braniff.

				BEN
		No - actually I'm just looking
		for a friend.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		I'm afraid I don't understand.

				BEN
			(backing off)
		I'm not with your party - I'm
		sorry.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Hey - I don't get it.

	Ben is backing out.

				MISS DeWITTE
		I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr.
		Braniff.

				MRS. SINGLEMAN
		Angela - please!

	Ben backs out of the ballroom.

49	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben crosses the lobby, passing PEOPLE going in and out of
	the hotel.  He stops at the entrance of the Veranda Room:

50	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	This is a large room with a bar and many tables along the
	windows that look out over the hotel grounds.  It is quite
	dark and cool inside and there are no more than a dozen
	people seated around.

	The CAMERA STAYS at the door as Ben walks into the room
	and crosses to the far end where he sits down at the table
	by the window.

	PUSH IN toward Ben as he sits there.  MUZAK is playing.

								CUT TO:

54	ANGLE ON BEN

	In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson.
	She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts
	toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does
	not see her approach.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh.  Hello.  Hello.

	He rises quickly.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I sit down?

				BEN
		Of course.

	He pulls out a chair, for her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	They sit down.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How are you?

				BEN
		Very well.  Thank you.

	Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down
	at the center of the table.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I have a drink?

				BEN
		A drink?  Of course.

	Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand.
	The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs.
	Robinson apologetically.

				BEN
		He didn't see me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Waiter!

	For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The
	waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter
	moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back.
	The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I will have a martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Yes, madam.

	The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to be so nervous,
		you know.

				BEN
		Nervous.  Well, I am a bit
		nervous.  I mean it's - it's
		pretty hard to be suave when
		you're -

	He shakes his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did you get us a room?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Have you gotten us a room yet?

				BEN
		I haven't.  No.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to?

				BEN
		Well - I don't.  I mean I could.
		Or we could just talk.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want me to get it?

				BEN
		You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to get it now?

				BEN
		Now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I don't know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you get it.

				BEN
		Why don't I get it?  Well -
		I will then.
			(he stands up)
		If you'll excuse me.

	Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

55	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.

				ROOM CLERK
		Yes sir?

				BEN
		A room.  I'd like a room,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		A single room or a double
		room?

				BEN
		A single.  Just for myself,
		please.

				ROOM CLERK
		Will you sign the register,
		please?

	He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben.  Ben writes his
	name on the card and then stares at it for a moment,
	crumples it up and fills out a second card.

				ROOM CLERK
		Is anything wrong, sir?

				BEN
		What?  No.  Nothing.

				ROOM CLERK
			(taking a key from
			behind the counter)
		Do you have any luggage, Mister --
			(looks at registration
			card)
		Gladstone?

				BEN
		Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is it?

				BEN
		What?

				ROOM CLERK
		Where is your luggage?

				BEN
		Well it's in the car.  It's
		out in the car.

				ROOM CLERK
		Very good, sir.  I'll have a
		porter bring it in.

				BEN
		Oh no.

				ROOM CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		I mean I'd - I'd rather not
		go to the trouble of bringing
		it all in.  I just have a
		toothbrush.  I can get it my-
		self.  If that's all right.

				ROOM CLERK
		Of course.

	Ben reaches for the key.

				ROOM CLERK
		I'll have a porter show you the
		room.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well actually, I'd just as
		soon find it myself.  I just have
		the toothbrush to carry up and
		I think I can manage it myself.

				ROOM CLERK
		Whatever you say, sir.

	He hands Ben the key.

				BEN
		Thank you.

56	INT. VERANDA ROOM - NIGHT

	Mrs. Robinson sits, patiently and calmly.  Her face betrays
	absolutely nothing as she stares ahead of her and sips
	her martini.

				WAITER No. 1
		Mrs. Robinson.

	She looks up.  A waiter is standing next to the table
	with a telephone.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

	The waiter plugs the phone into the wall socket next to
	the table and hands her the receiver.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

	The waiter nods and leaves.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(into phone)
		Hello.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Mrs. Robinson?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		It's Benjamin.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Benjamin Braddock.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin -- where are you?

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you look through the glass.

	Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the
	glass into the lobby.

57	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT - WHAT SHE SEES

	Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty
	feet away.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Can you see me now?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes, I can.

58	INT. LOBBY PHONE BOOTH

	Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the
	glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in
	the Veranda Room.

	INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION

				BEN
		I got a single room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's fine.

				BEN
		But there's one thing.  The desk clerk
		seemed to be a little bit suspicious.
		I mean - I don't know what their policy
		is - but -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well - do you want to go up first?

				BEN
		Yes - I think that would be good.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll be up in five minutes.

				BEN
		Well - goodbye then -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Isn't there something you want to
		tell me?

				BEN
		To tell you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well - I want you to know how much
		I appreciate this - really -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The number.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The room number, Benjamin.  I think
		you ought to tell me that.

				BEN
		Oh?  You're absolutely right.  Absolutely.
		It's 512.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.  Well - I'll see you
		later, Mrs. Robinson.

	He hangs up.

59	INT. LOBBY - PHONE BOOTH - SHOT - BEN

	He leaves the hpone booth and walks back into the main lobby.

60	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts
	to pat his breast pocket.

				BEN
		I've got it.

	The desk clerk looks up.

				BEN
		I say I've got it.

				CLERK
		Sir?

				BEN
		The toothbrush.  I got it all right.

				CLERK
		Very good, sir.

				BEN
		Yes.  Well - goodnight.

				CLERK
		Goodnight, sir.

	Ben walks out of shot.

60A	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Ben leaves elevator, walks down corridor to hotel room and
	opens door.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben closes the door behind him and leans with his back against
	it for a few moments looking at the room.  The only light
	is that coming in the window.  Ben turns on the light switch
	on the wall near the door.  The room blazes with the light
	from three lamps and an overhead fixture.  He turns the switch
	off.  He crosses to the bathroom.  Ben steps in and turns on
	the light.

61	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben steps out, moves to the window.  We see the pool area
	through the window.  Ben closes the blinds.

61Cont.There is a KNOCK on the door.  Ben crosses to the door and
	opens it.  Mrs. Robinson moves to the bureau and puts her
	purse and gloves on it.  She looks at herself in the
	mirror for a moment then turns slowly, looking at the room,
	finally ending on Ben's face.  She steps toward him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

	He clears his throat and then he kisses her.

				BEN
		Well.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin.

				BEN
		Yes?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I'll get undressed now.  Is that all
		right?

				BEN
		Sure.  Shall I - I mean shall I just
		stand here?  I mean - I don't know
		what you want me to do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why don't you watch?

				BEN
		Oh - sure.  Thank you.

	She takes off her jacket.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you bring me a hanger?

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		A hanger.

	Ben opens the closet door.

				BEN
		Oh - yes.  Wood?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Wood or wire?  They have both.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Either one will be fine.

				BEN
		Okay.

	He brings her a hanger.  She puts her jacket on it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Will you help me with this,
		please?

	She turns her back.

				BEN
		Certainly.

	He undoes the zipper at her neck.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		You're welcome.

	She turns and looks at him.  He backs away.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Would this be easier for you
		in the dark?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I can't do
		this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You what?

				BEN
		This is all terribly wrong.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin - do you find me undesirable?

				BEN
		Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.  I think -
		I think you're the most attractive
		of all my parents' friends.
		I just don't think we could
		possibly --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you afraid of me?

				BEN
		No - but look - maybe we could
		do something else together,
		Mrs. Robinson - would you like
		to go to a movie.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, is this your first time?

				BEN
		Is this - what?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It is, isn't it?  It is your
		first time.

				BEN
		That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
		That's really a laugh.  Ha ha.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You can admit that, can't you?

				BEN
		Are you kidding?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It's nothing to be ashamed of -

				BEN
		Wait a minute!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On your first time -

				BEN
		Who said it was my first time.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That you're afraid -

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		 - of bring - inadequate -  I mean
		just because you happen to be
		inadequate in one way - 

				BEN
		INADEQUATE!

	LONG pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(starting to dress)

				BEN
		Don't move.

	He slams the bathroom door shut.  The light in the room
	disappears.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

62	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool
	and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the
	pool.  Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds
	a beer can in one hand.

	SOUNDS:  teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby pools;
	a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to
	a ball game.

65	CLOSE SHOT - BEN

	SOUND of the back door CLOSING.  Ben opens his eyes and
	moves his head slightly.

66	WHAT HE SEES

	Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire.  Mrs.
	Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some
	ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil.

67	SHOT - BEN

	He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool.  He
	climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a
	chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and
	goes through.

68	INT. SPECIAL SET - TAFT HOTEL ROOM

	Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him.  He
	is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers.

	PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson
	who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her brace-
	let and watch.  He moves to a chair and sits.

	He picks up a cigarette from an ashtray on a table next
	to the chair.  Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in
	front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt.

	He takes the cigarette out of his mouth.

	We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock
	den, in which Ben is sitting.  In the dining room, Mr.
	and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking
	through the doorways toward Ben.  Ben stands, crosses back
	to the door to the den and shuts it.

70	INT. BRADDOCK DEN - NIGHT - REVERSE

	On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits.  A
	television set, facing the chair, is on.  Ben picks up a
	can of beer and drinks from it.  An animated cartoon is
	playing on the television set.  Ben watches it.

71	REVERSE

	Ben's face, watching.  PUSH IN to CLOSEUP of his face.

72	REVERSE

	CLOSEUP of television set and cartoon.

73	REVERSE

	Ben watching.

74	REVERSE

	CLOSEUP test pattern.

								CUT TO:

75	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSEUP Ben watching.  PULL BACK and we are in the Taft
	Hotel Room.  Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against
	the headboard, watching the television set which is on a
	stand facing the bed.

	SOUND of the HUM of the test pattern.

	PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light
	from the television set.  Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot,
	half dressed.  She passes between Ben and the television
	set and goes out of frame.  Ben continues to stare at the set.

	SOUND of a ZIPPER being pulled up.

	Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way.

	SOUND of BRACELETS being put on.

	Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again.

	SOUND of CLOTHING being put on and a PURSE being snapped
	closed.  Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying
	her purse, passes through again and, without looking at
	Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and
	exits.

76	INT. BENS' ROOM - CLOSEUP - BEN - DAY

	SOUND of DOOR closing.  Follow Ben as he gets up and moves
	to the windows of what is now his BEDROOM in the Braddock
	house.  He opens the closed blinds over the window.  The
	sun is bright outside.  His bathing suit is on the window
	sill.  He takes the suit and puts it on.  He moves to
	the bedroom door, opens it and goes out.

77	OMITTED

78	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	We see Mrs. Braddock in the kitchen.  Ben comes through
	the back door, moves to the pool and dives in.  The raft
	floats in the center of the pool.

79	SHOT - UNDERWATER

	Ben swims toward us the length of the pool.

80	SHOT - AT THE WATERLINE

	Ben surfaces and, in one movememt, pulls himself up on
	the raft and - 

								CUT TO:

81	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	- lands on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed.  He stays
	on top of her for a moment.

				MR. BRADDOCK'S VOICE
		Ben - what are you doing?

	Ben turns toward us and looks.

								CUT TO:

82	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY
	SHOT - POV OF BEN ON RAFT

	Mr. Braddock standing by the side of the pool.  The
	sun is behind him.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Well - I would say that I'm
		just drifting.

								CUT TO:

83	SHOT - BEN ON RAFT

				BEN
		- here - in the pool.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Why?

				BEN
		Well - it's very comfortable -
		just to drift here.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Have you thought about graduate
		school?

				BEN
		No.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Would you  mind telling me then -
		what were those four years of
		college for?  What was the point
		of all that hard work?

				BEN
		You got me.

				MR. BRADDOCK
			(trying unsuccessfully
			to control himself)
		Now listen, Ben.  I think it's
		a very good thing that a young
		man - after he's done some very
		good work - should have a chance
		to relax and enjoy himself, and
		lie around, and drink beer and
		so on.  But after a few weeks
		I believe that person would
		want to take some stock in him-
		self and his situation and start
		to think about getting off his
		ass.

	Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		The Robinson's are here.

	Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others.  They blot out
	the sun.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Hi, Ben.  What are you doing with
		yourself these days?

				BEN
		Oh - not too much.  Taking it
		easy.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's what I'd do if I could.
		Nothing wrong with that.  Hey
		Ben, Elaine's coming down from
		Berkeley soon.  I want you to
		call her up this time.

				BEN
		I will.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Because I just think you two
		would hit it off real well
		together.

	Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them.  (A long pause)

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Say hello to Mrs. Robinson,
		Benjamin.

84	SHOT - BEN

				BEN
		Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Hello, Benjamin.

							DISSOLVE TO:

85	INT. BEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Ben, halfway dressed to go out, in slacks, shirt and tie,
	sits in a chair.  The door opens and Mrs. Braddock enters.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Can I talk to you a minute?

				BEN
		Sure.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin?  I'm going to ask you
		something but you don't have to
		tell me if you don't want.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well I'm going to ask you what
		you do when you go off at night.

				BEN
		When I go off?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		You don't have to tell me if
		you don't want.

				BEN
		No, I do.  I want to tell you.

	There is a pause.

				BEN
		I drive around.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What else?

				BEN
		Nothing else.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well you don't drive around from
		midnight until noon the next
		day, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Oh, no.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Then what do you do?  Do you
		meet someone?

				BEN
		Meet someone?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well this is your business,
		Benjamin.
			(she starts toward
			the door)
		If you -

				BEN
		No wait.  Wait.

	She stops.

				BEN
		I don't meet anyone, mother, but
		why did you say that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Benjamin, I'm not going to pry
		into your affairs, but I'd
		rather you didn't say anything
		at all than be dishonest.
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, wait.

	She looks at him.

				BEN
		You think I'm being dishonest?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Well why do you - why do you
		think that?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Because I know you don't drive
		around for twelve hours.

				BEN
		Oh.  Well, I don't.  Shall I
		tell you what I do?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Not if you don't want to.

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But I don't want you to make
		up something.

				BEN
		I'm not.  But I'm - I'm not very
		proud of what I do.  I usually
		get kind of drunk.  I usually
		drive over to Los Angeles and
		go to some bars and get kind of
		drunk.  Then I take a hotel
		room.  So I won't have to drive
		home on the freeway.  I mean it
		kind of scares me to drive home
		after - 

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Goodnight, Benjamin.

				BEN
		You believe me, don't you?

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		No.

				BEN
		You don't?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		But I want you to.  Please. Please
		will you believe me.

85A	SHOT - MRS. BRADDOCK

				MRS. BRADDOCK
			(she exits)
		Goodnight.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Wait a minute.

								CUT TO:

86-
90	OMITTED

91	INT. TAFT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - SHOT - BEN

	Mrs. Robinson's hands are undoing his necktie.  Ben is
	dressed as in previous scene, plus a jacket.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.
			(he pushes her
			hand away)
		Sit down a minute.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows.

				BEN
		Will you please sit down a
		minute.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the bed and sits.  She reaches
	down to take off a shoe.

				BEN
		Will you leave that shoe on for
		a minute.  Please.

	She straightens up.

				BEN
		Now - do you think we could say
		a few words to each other first
		this time?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If you want.

				BEN
		Good.  I mean are we dead or
		something?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well I just don't think we have
		much to say to each other.

				BEN
		All we ever do is come up here
		and throw off the clothes and
		leap into bed together.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you tired of it?

				BEN
		I'm not.  No.  But do you think
		we could liven it up with a
		few words now and then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well what do you want to talk
		about?

				BEN
		Anything.  Anything at all.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to tell me about
		some of your college experiences?

				BEN
		Oh my God.

			MRS. ROBINSON
		Well?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson.  If that's the best
		we can do let's just get the god-
		damn clothes off and --

	She reaches for her shoe.

				BEN
		Leave it on!  Now we are going to
		do this thing.  We are going to
		have a conversation.  Think of
		another topic.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How about art.

				BEN
		Art.  That's a good subject.
		You start it off.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You start it off.  I don't know
		anything about it.

				BEN
		Oh.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you?

				BEN
		Yes I do.  I know quite a bit
		about it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go ahead then.

				BEN
		Art.  Well what do you want to
		know about it.

	She shrugs.

				BEN
		Are you interested more in modern
		art or more in classical art.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Neither.

				BEN
		You're not interested in art?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Then why do you want to talk
		about it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

	Ben nods and looks at the rug.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I take off my clothes now?

				BEN
		No.  Think of another topic.
		Tell me what you did today.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you really want me to?

				BEN
		Yes I do.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.

	Ben starts shaking his head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you want to hear it or not?

				BEN
		Yes.  But you might try and spice
		it up with a little originality.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I got up.  I ate breakfast and
		went shopping.  During the after-
		noon I read a novel.

				BEN
		What one.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		What novel did you read.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't remember.

	Ben nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then I fixed supper for my husband
		and waited until -

				BEN
		There!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Your husband!  Mrs. Robinson!
		There's something we could have
		a conversation about.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Him?

				BEN
		I mean everything.  I don't know
		anything about how you - how you
		work this.  I don't know how you
		get out of the house at night.  I
		don't know the risk involved.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There isn't any.

				BEN
		There's no risk?

	She shakes her head.

				BEN
		How do you get out of the house?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I walk out.

				BEN
		You walk right out the door.

	She nods.

				BEN
		What do you say to him?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		He's asleep.

				BEN
		Always?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, this isn't a very
		interesting topic.

				BEN
		Please.  Now tell me.  How do
		you know he won't wake up
		sometime and follow you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because he takes sleeping pills.
		He takes three sleeping pills
		every night at ten o'clock.

				BEN
		But what about the noise from
		the car.  What if -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		The driveway's on my side of
		the house.

				BEN
			(smiling)
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		We're talking, Mrs. Robinson.
		We're talking.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Calm down, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Now let's keep going here.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Can I undress and talk at the
		same time?

				BEN
		Right.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Now.  You say the driveway's on
		your side of the house.  So I
		guess you don't sleep in the
		same room.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We don't.

				BEN
		So you don't - I mean I don't
		like to seem like I'm prying
		but I guess you don't sleep
		together or anything.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No we don't.

				BEN
		Well how long has this been going
		on.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at the
			ceiling for a moment)
		About five years.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Are you kidding me?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		You have not slept with your
		husband for five years?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Now and then.  He geats drunk a
		few times a year.

				BEN
		How many times a year.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		On New Year's Eve.  Sometimes on
		his birthday.

				BEN
		Man, is this interesting.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		So you don't love him.  You
		wouldn't say you -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We've talked enough, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  So you wouldn't
		say you loved him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not exactly.

				BEN
		But you don't hate him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No, Benjamin.  I don't hate him.
		Unhook my blouse.

				BEN
			(unhooking her blouse)
		Well how do you feel about him,
		then?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't.

				BEN
		Well that's kind of a bad
		situation then, isn't it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Is it?

				BEN
		I mean it doesn't sound like it
		could be much worse.  If you
		hated him at least you'd hate
		him.

	She nods and takes off her blouse.

				BEN
		Well you loved him once, I
		assume.  When you first knew
		him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		What?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I never did, Benjamin.  Now
		let's -

				BEN
		Well, wait a minute.  You married
		him.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Why did you do that?

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(taking off her
			stockings)
		See if you can guess.

				BEN
		Well I can't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Think real hard, Benjamin.

				BEN
		I can't see why you did, unless
		...you didn't have to marry him
		or anything, did you?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't tell Elaine.

				BEN
		Oh no.  You had to marry him
		because you got pregnant?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you shocked?

				BEN
		Well I never thought of you and
		Mr. Robinson as the kind of
		people who...

				MRS. ROBINSON
		All right.  Now let's get to bed.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
		So how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		I mean do you feel like telling
		me what were the circumstances?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Not particularly.

				BEN
		Was he a law student at the time?

	She nods.

				BEN
		And you were a student also.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		At college.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		What was your major?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Why are you asking me all this?

				BEN
		Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.
		Now what was your major subject
		at college?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Art.

				BEN
		Art?

	She nods.

				BEN
		But I thought you - I guess you
		kind of lost interest in it over
		the years then.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Kind of.

				BEN
		Well how did it happen?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		How do you think.

				BEN
		I mean did he take you up to
		his room with him?  Did you go
		to a hotel?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, what does it possibly
		matter?

				BEN
		I'm curious.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		We'd go to his car.

				BEN
		Oh no.  In the car you did it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I don't think we were the first.

	Ben thinks for a moment.

				BEN
		What kind of car was it?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Do you remember the make of the
		car?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Oh my God.

				BEN
		Really.  I want to know.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		It was a Ford, Benjamin.

				BEN
			(jumping up)
		A Ford!  A Ford!  Goddamnit, a
		Ford!  That's great!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's enough.

				BEN
		So old Elaine Robinson got started
		in a Ford.

	There is a pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't talk about Elaine.

				BEN
		Don't talk about Elaine?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Why not?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Because I don't want you to.

	She walks to the bed.

				BEN
		Well why don't you?

	She pulls the bedspread down.  Ben begins to remove his
	jacket.

				BEN
		I wish you'd tell me.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		There's nothing to tell.

				BEN
		Well why is she a big taboo
		subject all of a sudden?

	Mrs. Robinson uncovers one of the pillows.

				BEN
		Well - I guess I'll have to ask
		her out on a date and find out
		what's --

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, don't you ever take
		that girl out.

	Ben looks at her.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Do you understand that?

				BEN
		Well look.  I have no intention
		of taking her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		I was just kidding around.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Good.

				BEN
		But why shouldn't I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I have my reasons.

				BEN
		Then let's hear them.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		No.

				BEN
		Let's hear your reasons, Mrs.
		Robinson.  Because I think I
		know what they are.

	She pulls the covers down.

				BEN
		I'm not good enough for her to
		associate with, am I?  I'm not
		good enough to even talk about
		her, am I?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Let's drop it.

				BEN
		We're not dropping it.  Now
		that's the reason, isn't it?
		I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't
		I?  I'm not fit to -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		I'm good enough for you but I'm
		too slimy to associate with
		your daughter.  That's it, isn't
		it?  ISN'T IT?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Yes.

				BEN
		You go to hell.  You go straight
		to hell, Mrs. Robinson.  Do you
		think I'm proud of myself?  Do
		you think I'm proud of this?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I wouldn't know.

				BEN
		Well, I'm not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You're not.

				BEN
		No sir.  I am not proud that I
		spend my time with a broken-
		down alcoholic!

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I see.

				BEN
		And if you think I come here
		for any reason besides pure
		boredom, then you're all wrong.

	She nods.

				BEN
		Because - Mrs. Robinson this
		is the sickest, most perverted
		thing that ever happened to
		me.  And you do what you want
		but I'm getting the hell out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Are you?

				BEN
		You're goddamn right I am.

	He starts putting on his shirt.  She sits on the edge of
	the bed and watches him.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That's how you feel about me.

	He nods.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		That I'm a sick and disgusting
		person.

				BEN
		Now don't start this.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		What?

				BEN
		Don't start acting hurt.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Don't you expect me to be a
		little hurt?

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, you stand there
		and tell me I'm not good enough
		for your daughter.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Did I say that?

				BEN
		Of course you did.

	She shakes her head.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Benjamin, I want to apologize
		to you if that's the impression
		you got.

				BEN
		Well two minutes ago you told
		me I wasn't good enough for
		your daughter.  Now you say
		you're sorry I got that
		impression.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I didn't mean it.  I don't think
		you'd be right for each other.
		But I would never say you
		weren't as good a person as
		she is.

				BEN
		You wouldn't.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Of course I wouldn't.

	Mrs. Robinson walks to the closet.

				BEN
		What are you doing?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Well it's pretty obvious you
		don't want me around any more.

				BEN
		Well look - I was kind of upset
		there.  I'm sorry I said those
		things.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		If that's how you feel -

				BEN
		But it's not.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(smiling at him)
		That's all right.  I think I
		can understand why I'm disgusting
		to you.

				BEN
		Oh no.  Look - I like you.  I
		wouldn't keep coming here if
		I didn't like you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But if it's sickening for you -

				BEN
		It's not!  I enjoy it!  I look
		forward to it.  It's the one
		thing I have to look forward
		to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		You don't have to say that.

				BEN
		Well I wouldn't.  I would never
		say it if it wasn't true.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		May I stay then?

				BEN
		Yes. Please.  I want you to.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.

				BEN
		Well don't thank me, because I
		want you to.

	There is a long pause.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		But you won't ever take out
		Elaine, will you?  I want you
		to promise me that.

	There is another long pause.

				BEN
		Look.  Why the hell did you
		bring this up.  It never
		occured to me to take her out.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then give me your word you won't.

				BEN
		This is absurd.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Promise me, Benjamin.

				BEN
		All right, for christ's sake.
		I promise I will never take
		out Elaine Robinson.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Thank you.
			(pause)
		Benjamin -

				BEN
		Let's not talk about it.  Let's
		not talk at all.

	At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each
	other, they begin to take off their clothes.

								FADE OUT

	FADE IN

92	INT. BRADDOCK KITCHEN - DAY

	Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking
	at the back of a cereal box.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock
	are there.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Elaine's back from school.  I
		think it might be a nice gesture
		if you asked her out.

	Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues
	eating and reading.

								CUT TO:

93	INT. BEN'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben is lying on his bed.  Mrs. Braddock stands in the
	doorway.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't you think that she's a
		terribly attractive girl?
		Because I think she's one of
		the prettiest girls I've
		ever seen.

	Ben gives a small whimper.

								CUT TO:

94	EXT. BRADDOCK BACKYARD AND POOL AREA - DAY

	Ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the
	Braddock pool.  The sun shines down.  His diving mask
	is on over his eyes.  His face is in the water, looking
	down at the bottom of the pool.  Mr. and Mrs. Braddock,
	in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around
	Ben.  During the entire conversation they continue to
	swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep
	their heads above the surface.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		It's pretty embarrassing.  I
		really don't know what to tell
		Mr. Robinson.  It's ackward
		and strained for me every time
		he suggests that you call up
		Elaine.

				BEN
		Next time he suggests it,
		I'll tell him I have no
		intention of ever calling
		her up in my life.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess she's not good enough
		for you, is that it?

				BEN
		Look - Elaine Robinson and I
		do not get along.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		How do you know?  You haven't
		seen her since high school.  I
		guess your evenings, whatever
		you do with them, are just too
		valuable.

				BEN
		That has nothing to do with it -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson
		that you're just too busy every
		evening - doing God knows what -

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Don't go on like this.  Now if
		Benjamin absolutely refuses to
		take her out -

				BEN
		I do.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		- then I'll simply invite all the

	The dining room is one tenth its normal size.  At a
	table for two are seated, jammed in against each other,
	the three Robinsons and the three Braddocks.  Elaine's
	back is to us.  Ben is at the other end of the table,
	facing us.  The Robinsons and Braddocks sit along
	the sides.  Mrs. Robinson is next to Ben, everyone is
	eating, looking down at their places.  After a few moments
	Ben throws his head back ans starts to scream.  As he
	continues to scream, everyone looks at him except Mrs.
	Robinson who continues to eat calmly without looking up.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Braddock - it's about

		Come on in.  I'm afraid the
		young lady isn't quite ready
		yet -

	Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.  Mrs. Robinson is
	sitting there.

				BEN
		Hello.

				MR. ROBINSON
		What would you say to a short one?
		Bourbon still your drink?

				BEN
		Yes.

	Mr. Robinson hands him drink.

	Mr. Robinson and ELAINE enter.

				ELAINE
		Hello.

				BEN
		Hello.

101	CLOSEUP - MRS. ROBINSON

				MR. ROBINSON'S VOICE
		Well - I want you to keep your
		wits about you tonight.  You never
		know what tricks Ben picked up
		back there in the East.

							LAP DISSOLVE TO:

102	EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE in Ben's car.  From the back.  Ben
	leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in
	and out of the traffic.  Ben is wearing dark glasses.

				ELAINE
		You're living at home now.  Is
		that right?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		Do you know what you're going
		to do?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Are you going to graduate school?

				BEN
		No.

	He leans on the HORN.  The car directly ahead of him
	does not move to the right.  Ben jerks his car over to the
	right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn
	down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the
	driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him.
	Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance.

				ELAINE
		Do you always drive like this?

				BEN
		Yes.

								CUT TO:

103	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	A drab, almost deserted room with formally dressed WAITERS.
	Ben and Elaine are seated at a table.

				BEN
		Do you want some dinner?

				ELAINE
		I'd love some.

	A waiter moves forward toward them.

				BEN
		Bring a menu.

				WAITER #2
		Dinner for two, sir?

				BEN
		No.  Just for her.

	The waiter moves away.

				ELAINE
		Aren't you eating?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Why not?

				BEN
		If it's all right with you,
		I'm not hungry.

	The waiter returns with a menu.

				ELAINE
		I've changed my mind.  Thank
		you.

								CUT TO:

104	EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT - SHOTS

	Ben and Elaine walking on the strip.

105	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Ben pushes through the people crowded in around the
	entrance.  Without turning around, he waits for Elaine
	who has difficulty following him.  As she gets to him,
	he starts forward again.  He starts up the stairs.
	Elaine is just behind him.

								CUT TO:

106	INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	Seedy, ugly, three quarters filled.  A tuxedoed HOOD leads
	them through the tables to a table directly under the stage
	on which a STRIPPER is in the process of removing her
	dress.  There is one chair facing the stage, the other with
	its back to and up against the stage.  Ben sits down in
	the chair facing the stage.  Elaine stands for a moment,
	unsure.

				BEN
		Sit down.

	Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage.
	She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them.
	Ben takes a pair of dark glasses out of his pocket and
	puts them on.  The two chairs are slightly angled toward
	each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without
	looking directly at Elaine.

				BEN
		Why don't you watch the show?

	The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - do you dislike me
		for some reason?

				BEN
		No - why should I?

				ELAINE
		I don't know.

107	SHOT - ACROSS BEN - THE STRIPPER

	She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string.  She is
	twirling the tassels.

				BEN
		You're missing a great effect
		here.

	Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns
	back.

				BEN
		How do you like that?

	Elaine doesn't answer.

				BEN
		Could you do it?

				ELAINE
		No.

	The stripper sees Elaine look.  The stripper smiles toward
	Ben and walks toward his table, twirling the tassels as she
	walks.  Ben smiles as he watches her approaching.

	The stripper moves directly behind Elaine's chair.  The
	spotlight from the back of the house falls into Elaine's
	face.  As it does, Elaine puts her hand up to shield
	her eyes.

	The stripper slides a finger into her mouth, wets it
	and holds it up in the air.  The music stops and a
	DRUM ROLL starts.  The stripper bends over Elaine's head
	and begins swinging the tassels so that they rotate in
	front of Elaine's face.

108	SHOT - BEN

	He leans forward slightly to watch the action.  The
	swinging tassels are reflected in his glasses.

	The DRUM ROLL gets louder and faster.  The tassels
	swing more frantically.

109	SHOT - ELAINE

	She pulls her hand down from in front of her eyes.

110	SHOT - BEN

	With Elaine's face reflected in his glasses.

111	SHOT - ELAINE

	Through Ben's glasses.  Elaine's face seen darkly but
	fully for the first time.  The tassels swing in front
	of it.  Tears start out of her eyes.

112	SHOT - BEN

	He reaches up to remove the glasses.

113	SHOT - ELAINE

	As the glasses come off and her face is seen in the harsh
	spill from the spotlight.  The tears are running down
	her face.  Only her eyes are crying as she looks straight
	at Ben.

114	SHOT - BEN

	With his glasses off, he watches her.  He reaches forward
	and puts his hand in the way of the tassels.

				STRIPPER
		Hey!

	Some of the customers start to boo.  Ben rises, takes
	Elaine's arm and leads her toward the exit.

								CUT TO:

115	EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

	The entrance to the strip joint.  Elaine runs to the
	bottom of the steps.  The Sunset Strip sidewalk outside
	is crowded with people moving back and forth.  Ben follows
	her.  She pushes through the crowd on the sidewalk.  Ben
	catches her and holds her arm.

				BEN
		Elaine - I'm sorry.

	Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls
	her arm away.

				ELAINE
		Will you take me home now?

				BEN
		I'm sorry I took you in there.

				ELAINE
		I think I'd better go home now
		please.

				BEN
		But, Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Where is the car?

				BEN
		I just want to tell you something.

	Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying
	to get her to look at him.  She keeps looking away.

				ELAINE
		I want to go home.

				BEN
		But could I just tell you this
		one thing?

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		This whole idea - this date
		and everything.  It was my
		parents' idea.  They forced me
		into it.

				ELAINE
		Oh - that's very nice of
		you to tell me.

				BEN
		No.  What I mean is - that's
		why I've been acting this way.
		I'm not like this.  I hate
		myself like this.

	She starts to cry.  People on the sidewalk are looking at
	them.  She turns away from them.  Ben moves away from
	them.  Ben moves around in front of her.

				BEN
		Listen - could you stop crying,
		please?

				ELAINE
		No, I couldn't.

				BEN
		But could you try?

				ELAINE
		No.

	She brings both hands up to her face.  Ben looks at her
	for a few moments in agony.  Then, very determined, he
	takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from
	her face.  She looks up startled.  She starts to give a
	little cry but before she can he is kissing her.  She closes
	her eyes.

	He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side
	of her face.  He opens his hands against her face, freeing
	her hands.  Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang
	on.  After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly
	to one side.

				BEN
		Elaine -

	He starts to pull her head back.

				ELAINE
		Not here.  Not here.

							DISSOLVE TO:

116	EXT. DRIVE IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine are sitting in the car in a drive-in
	restaurant.  There are trays hooked onto windows along
	side of both of them.  They are eating and drinking
	furiously.

				BEN
		I've had this feeling - ever
		since I've graduated - this -
		kind of compulsion that I have
		to be rude all the time.  Do
		you know what I mean?

				ELAINE
		Yes, I do.

	He looks at her.

				BEN
		It's like I've been playing
		some kind of - game - but the
		rules don't make any sense to
		me -

	She is watching him carefully.

				BEN
		- they're being made up by all
		the wrong people - no - I mean
		no one makes them up, they seem
		to have made themselves up.

	A car with a COUPLE OF TEENAGERS has driven up in the
	slot on their right.  Its RADIO is tuned into a rock
	and roll station and it is playing LOUDLY.  Ben leans
	across Elaine and speaks through the window to the
	kid behind the wheel.

				BEN
		Say - I wonder if I could request
		you to turn that down a little?

	The kid turns the radio up.  Ben and Elaine roll their
	windows up.

117	SERIES OF SHOTS

	From outside of car.  Ben is talking with great animation
	- Elaine is watching him.  They are both eating as Ben
	talks, telling Elaine a story.  Their windows are rolled
	up.

	SOUNDS: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
	radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers
	YELLING at waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from
	car to car; MOTORCYCLES driving in and out, TRAFFIC.

								CUT TO:

118	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - NIGHT

	The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson
	house.  The RADIO plays QUIETLY.  Ben turns it OFF.  They
	sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's
	hand touching her shoulder.  It is very quiet.

				ELAINE
		Well - maybe I'd better go in.

	He nods.  They continue to sit there for another long
	moment.

				ELAINE
		Would you like to come in?  I
		could make some coffee.

				BEN
		No, I mean - I wouldn't want to
		wake anyone up.

				ELAINE
		We won't.  Let's go inside.

				BEN
		Wait a minute.

				ELAINE
		Is anything wrong?

				BEN
		No - I was just thinking -
		look - it's still early -
		we could do something - go
		somewhere else.

				ELAINE
		All right.

	He starts the car immediately and drives away from the
	house.

119	INT. BEN'S CAR - NIGHT

	Ben is driving.

				ELAINE
		Where we going?

				BEN
		I'm trying to think of where
		there's a place to have a
		drink around here.

				ELAINE
		Isn't there one in the Taft
		Hotel?

	There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off
	the road.

				ELAINE
		What is the matter?

				BEN
		Nothing.  I'm just wondering if
		they have a bar or not.  I mean
		let's go see.  Let's go see if
		they do or not.

120	INT. TAFT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside
	the door.  They start in a few steps.

				BEN
		Listen, Elaine - it seems to me
		that there isn't a bar in here.
		I mean - as far as I know.

				ELAINE
		Of course there is.  Look -
		The Veranda Room - right there.

	ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out.

				CAR PARKER
		Good evening.

	CAMERS BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY.  A BELLBOY passes
	them.

				BELLBOY
		Hello, how are you, sir?

	The room clerk smiles at them.

				ROOM CLERK
		Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

	Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the
	lobby.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT
	revealing many people moving back and forth in the
	lobby, passing Ben and Elaine.

				VOICE #1
		Hello again.

				VOICE #2
		Hi, Mr. Gladstone.  How are you

		Benjamin - do they know you?

				BEN
		Of course not.

				ELAINE
		Ben - what's happening?  Who

				BEN
		I don't know.  They must think
		I look like this guy Gladstone.

	PAN WITH THEM as they start down the steps.  Coming up
	the steps toward them is Miss DeWitte, on the arm of
	another ELDERLY LADY.

				MISS DeWITTE
		Hello, Mr. Brannif.

	SOUND:  Car STARTING noisily.

122	EXT. TAFT HOTEL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

	Ben and Elaine in his car.  He takes his hand off
	the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car
	speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes.  He
	turns off the ignition and the lights.  He puts his
	head down on the steering wheel.  He lifts his head.

				BEN
		Elaine - I like you.  I like you
		so much.  Do you believe that?

	She nods.

				BEN
		Do you?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		You're the first - you're the
		first thing for so long that
		I've liked.  The first person
		I could stand to be with.

	She takes his hand.

				BEN
		I mean my whole life is such a
		waste.  It's just nothing.  I'm
		sorry.  I'll take you home now.

	He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - are having an
		affair with someone?

	He freezes with his hand still on the key.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.

	He turns off the engine.

				ELAINE
		I'm sorry.  That is not my
		business.

				BEN
		It just happened.  It was just
		this thing that happened along
		with everything else.  Can you
		understand that?

	She nods.

				ELAINE
		Was she married or something?

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		With a family?

				BEN
		Yes.  She had a husband and a
		son.

				ELAINE
		Did they ever find out?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		And it's all over now.

				BEN
		Yes.

				ELAINE
		I'm glad.

	He starts the car and drives out.

		During the day?  We'll go for

				ELAINE
		Okay.

				BEN
		You sure you really want to?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Because I wouldn't want you to

				ELAINE
		I do.

				BEN
		You do?

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I really do.

124	EXT. STREET NO. 1 - NEAR ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY
	SHOT - INT. BEN'S CAR - BEN DRIVING

	It is raining.  On the seat beside Ben is a package.
	From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift.
	Ben's right hand is on it as he drives.  The radio is
	playing.  Past Ben and through the windsheild as the
	Robinson house comes closer and closer.  The front door
	of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out,
	dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps,
	reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side
	and climbs in.  Ben moves the package over into his lap.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Drive down the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson - I have a date
		with Elaine.  We're going for
		a drive.

				MRS. ROBINSON
			(looking at him
			for the first time)
		Do exactly what I say.

	Ben starts the car forward down the driveway.

125	ANOTHER ANGLE - BEN AND MRS. ROBINSON

	As they drive.

				BEN
		Now it seems to me -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Listen to me very carefully,
		Benjamin.  You are not to see
		Elaine again.  Ever.  Those
		are my orders.  Is that clear?

	Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down
	the block.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson -

				MRS. ROBINSON
		I can makes things quite unpleasant.

				BEN
		How?

				MRS. ROBINSON
		In order to keep Elaine away
		from you - I am prepared to
		tell her everything.

				BEN
		I don't believe you.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Then you'd better start believing me.

				BEN
		Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it.  I'm
		asking you please not to wreck it.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Go home now.

				BEN
		I just don't believe you would do that.

	Mrs. Robinson looks at him for a moment.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Try me.

	There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression.  Then
	he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on
	his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package.

	TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the drive-
	way toward the Robinson house.  Ben gets to the front
	door.

				BEN

	Ben runs in.

		I'm not dressed yet.

	Ben runs up the stairs.  He still carries the package.
	Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door
	to her bedroom.  She is wearing a skirt and slip and
	carrying one shoe.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed -

	Ben pushes her back into her room.

127	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

				ELAINE
		What's the matter?

				BEN
		You've got to go over the back

				BEN
		Hurry up.  Put your shoes on.

	Ben turns and looks.

128	SHOT - OVER BEN'S SHOULDER

	Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house.

				BEN
		NO.

	He turns around.

129	NEW ANGLE

	Elaine is standing in the doorway watching him.  She
	still holds the shoe in her hand.

				BEN
		Why aren't you ready?

				ELAINE
		Because I want to know what's
		happening.

	SOUND of Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS in the hall below.

				BEN
		There isn't time!

130	INT. ELAINE'S ROOM - DAY

	Ben pulls Elaine around behind the open door.  They stand
	in the angle formed by the door and the wall as though
	they are hiding from someone.  Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS
	can be heard coming up the stairs.

				BEN
		Elaine - I have to tell you
		something.

	He holds her against the wall in the corner.

				ELAINE
		What is it?

				BEN
		That woman -

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		That woman.  The older woman.

				ELAINE
		You mean the one who -

				BEN
		Yes.  The married woman - it
		wasn't just some woman -

	Mrs. Robinson's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the
	hall.

				ELAINE
		What are you telling me?

	The FOOTSTEPS stop.

131	ANGLE - CLOSE ON ELAINE

	Back in the corner.  Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the
	crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder.  Elaine looks from
	Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her
	mother's eyes staring.

				ELAINE
		Please - will somebody tell me -

	She looks back at Ben, then back at her mother's face again.
	Mrs. Robinson's eyes watch her through the crack in the
	door.  Elaine looks away.

				ELAINE
		Oh - no.

	Ben backs up.

				BEN
		Elaine -

				ELAINE
		Oh my God -

	Moving along the wall as though to keep as far from Ben
	as possible, Elaine moves away from the door.

				BEN
		Please.

	Elaine walks a few steps toward the other side of the room
	then turns back toward Ben.  The tears are starting out
	of her eyes.

				BEN
		No - don't cry -

				ELAINE
		GET OUT!

				BEN
		Don't cry.
			(holds the package
			out to her)

				ELAINE
		Get out of here.

	She moves toward him as though to hit him.  He backs into
	the hall.  Elaine SLAMS the door shut.

				ELAINE

		Get out!

	Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben.

	his chest.

134	INT. SPECIAL SET - ROBINSON HALL - DAY - SHOT - PULLING

	Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking
	the backyard.  Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock

	window.  Ben moves aside.

							DISSOLVE TO:

138	EXT. ROBINSON HOUSE - DAY

	Ben is standing behind a tree watching the

	It is early morning.  We see a swinging door pushed open

	from a MINUTE MAID container.  Ben stands inside door.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Say that again.

				BEN
		I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

	MR. BRADDOCK STARTS TO SMILE.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Well - well - well -

	He almost giggles as he crosses to Ben and takes his hand

	is shaking his father's hand.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		What's happening?

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben says he and Elaine are getting
		married.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		I don't believe it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		That what he says.  Right?

				BEN
		I'm going up to Berkeley today.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
		We've got something to celebrate.

				BEN
		No.  I think you'll want to wait
		on that.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		They don't know?

				BEN
		No - they don't.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		Well - when did you decide all
		this?

				BEN
		About an hour ago.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Wait a minute.  You talked to
		Elaine this morning?

				BEN
		No.  She doesn't know about it.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		She doesn't know that you're
		coming up to Berkeley?

				BEN
		No.  Actually - she doesn't
		know about us getting married
		yet.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		When did you two talk this over?

				BEN
		We haven't.

				MR. BRADDOCK
		Ben - this whole idea sounds
		pretty half-baked.

				BEN
		No - it's not.  It's completely
		baked.  It's a decision I've made.

				MRS. BRADDOCK
		But what makes you think she
		wants to marry you?

	Ben picks up his suitcase, walks to the door and turns.

				BEN
		She doesn't.  To be perfectly
		honest, she doesn't like me.

	She stops and slowly turns to look in his direction.  Her

				BEN
			(leaning in a little)
		I was wondering where you were

	Elaine doesn't answer.  The lady sitting next to Elaine
	takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben,

				ELAINE
		I'm meeting someone.

				BEN
		Ah.  Where?

	She doesn't answer.

		Where are you meeting this person?

		At the Zoo.

				BEN
		The Zoo.  They have a pretty good

		I've never been to it.

		Oh.  Well, I haven't either.  I
		might just ride out there with you.

	Hold on them riding.

		Is that him over there?

				ELAINE
		No.

				BEN
		Where did he say he was going

				ELAINE
		I thought he said by the monkey

		Oh.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - I would like to know

				BEN
		Here?  In Berkelely?

				ELAINE
		Yes.

				BEN
		Well, I have this very pleasant
		room on Carter Street - and I've
		been getting to some classes -

				ELAINE
		But you're not enrolled.

				BEN
		No.  I just sit in.  They don't

		Maybe we could get together

				ELAINE
		- really incredible -

				BEN
		Here he comes.

				ELAINE
		What?

				BEN
		I've got a real feeling that
		this is the fellow.

	Elaine looks.  A good-looking young man is striding
	briskly toward them.  It is CARL SMITH.

				CARL
			(waving)
		Elaine!

				BEN
		He certainly is a good walker.

	Carl strides up to them.  He takes the pipe out of his
	mouth and puts it in his pocket.  He reaches out and
	takes Elaine's hands.

				CARL
		Am I late?  I'm sorry.

				BEN
		We thought you said by the
		monkey house.

	Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben.
	Ben smiles.

				ELAINE
		This is Benjamin Braddock.
		Carl Smith.  Benjamin rode
		here with me on the bus.

				CARL
		Glad to meet you, Ben.

	Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand.

				BEN
		Great meeting you, Carl.

	Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder.
	The three of them look at each other for a moment.

				BEN
		Swell seeing you.  Have a good
		time.

	Ben turns and starts walking back the way he came.  Carl
	and Elaine turn and go in the opposite direction.  Ben
	stops after a few steps and walks over to one of the
	cages.  He grips the rail with his hand and looks back
	at:

177	SHOT - CARL AND ELAINE

	Walking away, his arm over her shoulder, his other hand
	gesturing with the pipe in it as he talks.

178	SHOT - BEN

	As he watches them go.  His artificial smile disappears.
	The agony is such that he has to steady himself with
	his hand on the rail.  He turns his face away, toward the
	cage.  There is an animal in it, staring at Ben.  They
	look at each other.  There is a box - an automatic device
	with a recorded desciption of the animal - that begins
	to deliver its RECORDED MESSAGE.

	He runs to the bed and puts the covers back into place.
	He goes to the window sill, picks up an empty beer can,
	crosses to the bureau, opens a bureau drawer.  He crosses
	to the wastepaper basket under the sink, bends down and
	takes a newspaper out of it.  He crosses to the chair and
	sits down.  He holds the newspaper in front of him.  It
	is hopelessly crumpled.  He gets up, crosses to the
	bureau, opens a drawer and takes out a traveling iron.
	He kneels down, puts the newspaper on the floor and tires
	to straighten it out with the iron.

	There is a KNOCK on the door.  He rises, puts the iron
	back in the drawer as quietly and quickly as he can,
	then back to the chair, sits down and holds the newspaper
	on his lap.

		Come in.

	There is another KNOCK.  Ben crosses to the door and opens

				ELAINE
		I want to ask you a question.

		Come in.

				ELAINE
		No.  I want to know why you're

		Because - I am.

				ELAINE
		Is it because I'm here?

		Well, I want you to leave.

	Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm.

				ELAINE
		Do you just hate everything?
		How could you possibly rape
		my...

				BEN
		What?

				ELAINE
		I don't understand -

				BEN
		Did you say rape her?

				ELAINE
		- how you - how anyone - could
		do a thing like that.

				BEN
		What did she say?

				ELAINE
			(holding his arm)
		Let me go.

				BEN
		You've got to tell me what she
		said.

	He touches her hair.

				ELAINE
		Why?

				BEN
		Because it isn't true.

				ELAINE
		I don't feel well.

	Ben pushes her down softly onto the bed.  He kneels
	along side her.

				BEN
		Tell me.

	Ben sits next to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.

				ELAINE
		She said she was having a drink
		in the hotel with a friend.
		You waited for her in the parking
		lot and told her she was too
		drunk to drive home and that
		you would get her a room for
		the night.

				BEN
		Then what?

				ELAINE
		Then you took her upstairs and
		you raped her.

				BEN
		Elaine - that is not what happened.

	She puts her hands on his shoulder.

				ELAINE
		Please let me go.

				BEN
		All right - but listen to me.
		What happened was there was
		this party at my parents.  I
		drove your mother home - then
		we went upstairs to see your
		portrait -

	Elaine tightens her arms around his neck.

				ELAINE
		Don't tell me -

				BEN
		- and when we got up in the
		room she starts taking her her
		clothes off - and -

				ELAINE
		Benjamin - this is my mother!

				BEN
		- suddenly there she was without
		any clothes on - I mean really
		naked -

	Ben is almost lying on top of her.  Elaine screams - a
	long, loud scream.  Ben looks at her.  He leaps off
	the bed and runs to the sink.  He fills a glass with
	water and brings it to Elaine.  He starts toward the
	door.

	SOUND OF FOOTESTEPS on the stairway and in the hall.
	Ben goes to the closet, opens the door, takes a jacket
	from a hanger and puts it on.

		Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.

		Who screamed?

				BEN
		It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

		Screaming isn't all right.  Not

		Look - she's all right.  She's

				A BOY
		Shall I get the cops?

				BEN
		What?

				A BOY
		I'll get the cops.

	He starts for the stairs.

				BEN
		Hey - wait a minute.  Now damn
		it - look.

	He opens the door a little way.  They all try to see in.

				BEN
		See - she's just having some
		water.  Now there's no need
		for the cops or anything.

				MR. McCLEERY
		All right, boys - I think you
		can get back to your rooms.  I
		don't think we'll have any more
		of this agitation.  Will we,

				BEN
		No, sir.

	The boys start back to their rooms.  Mr. McCleery and Ben
	stand and look at each other for a few seconds.

				MR. McCLEERY
		I want you out of here.

	Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts
	down the stairs.

				MR. McCLEERY
		You heard me.  Out of here.

				BEN
		What for?

		I'm sorry I screamed.

	Ben opens the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin, when you came up here,
		what did you think was going to
		happen between us?

				BEN
		Elaine - right now I don't feel
		like talking much.  I'm sorry
		about everything but I think I'll
		just do this now.

	He stands, looking into the empty suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Can I just sit here while you're
		packing?

				BEN
		If you want.

	Elaine sits in the chair.  She watches him as he goes to
	the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them
	in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau.  He gets
	down on his knees and looks under the bureau.

				ELAINE
		What are you looking for?

				BEN
		My belt.

				ELAINE
		Don't you have it on?

				BEN
		No.  I have two.  The other one
		is the one I'm looking for.
			(he reaches under
			the bureau)
		What's this?
			(he brings out a
			marble)
		It's from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		The marble?

				BEN
		The belt I'm looking for was
		from my grandmother.

				ELAINE
		Oh.

	Ben takes the marble to the suitcase and packs it.

				ELAINE
		What are you going to do now?

				BEN
		I don't know.

	He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear
	and carries them to the suitcase.

				ELAINE
		Are you going home?

				BEN
		No.

				ELAINE
		Well - where are you going?

	He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out
	some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the

				BEN
		Elaine - you're going to have to
		stop asking me that.

	He packs the T-shirts, then carries the beer can back to

				BEN

				ELAINE
		No, Benjamin.

				BEN
		Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

				ELAINE
		He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

	the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben,
	kisses him, then runs back inside.  Ben turns and starts

	pause.

				MR. ROBINSON
			(clearing his throat)
		Do you want - do you want to try
		and tell me why you did it?

				BEN
		Mr. Robinson?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you have a special grudge
		against me?  Do you feel a particularly
		strong resentment for me?

				BEN
		No, it's not --

				MR. ROBINSON
		Is there something I've said that's
		caused this contempt?  Or is it just
		the things I stand for that you
		despise?

				BEN
		It was nothing to do with you, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to
		do with me.

	Ben takes a step forward.

				BEN
		Now look - please -

				MR. ROBINSON
		Ben, I think we're two civilized
		human beings.  Do you think it's
		necessary to threaten each other?

				BEN
		I am not threatening you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Do you want to unclench your fists,
		please?  Thank you.  I can see in
		the dark, you know.  I've been here
		quite a while.

				BEN
		I am trying to tell you I have no
		personal feelings about you, Mr.
		Robinson.  I am trying to tell
		you I do not resent you.

				MR. ROBINSON
		You don't respect me terribly
		much either, do you?

				BEN
		No, I don't.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well, I don't think we have a
		whole lot to say to each other,
		Ben.  I do think you should know
		the consequences of what you've
		done.  I do think you should
		know that my wife and I are
		getting a divorce soon.

				BEN
		But why?

				MR. ROBINSON
		Why?

				BEN
		It shouldn't make any difference
		what happened.

				MR. ROBINSON
		That's quite a statement.

				BEN
		Listen to me.  We got - we got
		into bed with each other.  But
		it was nothing.  It was nothing
		at all.  We might - we might just
		as well have been shaking hands.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Shaking hands.  Well, that's not
		saying much for my wife, is it?

				BEN
		You miss the point.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Don't shout at me, Ben.

				BEN
		The point is - I don't love your
		wife.  I love your daughter, sir.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Well - I'm sure you think you do,
		Ben, but after a few times in
		bed with Elaine I feel quite sure
		you'd get over that as quickly
		as you -

				BEN
		HUH?

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think I've talked about this
		enough.  I don't know how far
		I can go, Ben.  I don't know if
		I can prosecute or not, but I
		think maybe I can.  In the light
		of what's happened I think maybe
		I can get you behind bars if you
		ever look at my daughter again.
		I have seen Elaine and I have
		spent the afternoon taking steps
		to insure...

	Mr. Robinson climbs across the bed to get to the door.
	Ben takes a step toward him.

				MR. ROBINSON
		Stay away from me, Ben!

	Mr. Robinson stands at the door.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I don't want to mince words with
		you.  As far as Elaine's concerned
		you're to get her out of your
		filthy mind right now.  Is that
		perfectly clear ro you?  That's
		all, Ben.  You'll pardon me if
		I don't shake hands with you.

	Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are filth.

	Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall.

				MR. ROBINSON
		I think you are scum.

	Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs.  Mr. McCleery is

		Look - I'll give you ten dollars

				MR. McCLEERY
		I am going to call the police now.

		Could I make one phone call first?

				MR. McCLEERY
		Get out!

	Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the

	Frozen frame.

267	SHOT - ELAINE

	Her face turning quickly to look up at Ben.

268	ELAINE'S POV - BEN

	Frozen frame.  His face twisted with passion, his body
	spread-eagled against the glass.

269	CLOSEUP - ELAINE

	looking up at Ben.

				ELAINE
			(screaming)
		Ben!

	The SOUND of the ORGAN and the guests' VOICES starts again.

270	INT. CHURCH VESTIBULE - STAIRS - DAY - SHOT - BEN

	He starts to go back down the stairs.  He reaches the
	bottom of the stairs and goes through a door which leads
	into the vestibule of the church.

271	INT. CHURCH VESTIBULE - DAY

	Mr. Robinson is waiting for Ben, crouching, his arms spread.
	Behind him is Elaine.  Ben moves toward them.  Mr. Robinson
	grabs Ben around the waist.  Ben twists away.  Mr. Robinson
	grabs Ben's collar and tears his jacket half off.  Ben
	turns and hits Mr. Robinson in the face.  Mr. Robinson
	falls down.  Ben moves to Elaine and grabs her hand.  He
	pulls her toward the doors.

				BEN
		Come on - don't faint.

272	SHOT - THE ORGANIST

	His back to the action, clawing away at the organ
	obliviously.

273	SHOT - THE DOOR

	A man in clerical garb is guarding the door.  Ben and
	Elaine move toward the door.

				BEN
		Out of my way!

	Carl steps in and grabs Ben from behind.  Ben breaks
	Carl's hold and picks up a gold cross off a nearby stand.
	He begins to swing it, advancing toward Carl.  Carl
	backs up toward the other guests.

274	NEW ANGLE

	Mrs. Robinson steps to Elaine.  She reaches out and takes
	Elaine's wrist.

				MRS. ROBINSON
		Elaine - it's too late.

	Elaine pulls her hand away.

				ELAINE
		Not for me.

275	SHOT BEN

	He turns toward the man standing in front of the door and
	raises the cross over his head.

				BEN
		MOVE!

	The man moves away from the door.  Elaine steps forward
	and opens the door.  She and Ben go out.

276	EXT. FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY

	Ben jams the cross through the handles of the door.  He
	grabs Elaine's wrist.

				BEN
		Run, Elaine, run!

	They start to run.  Elaine trips and falls.  Ben helps her
	up and they continue to run.

277	INT. CHURCH VESTIBULE - DAY

	From inside the church vestibule.  Through the glass
	doors, we can see Elaine and Ben running down the street.
	The wedding party members are tugging furiously at the
	jammed doors.  Mrs. Robinson turns toward us and calmly
	begins to put on her gloves.

278	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY

	Ben and Elaine running along the sidewalk.  Ben holds
	her hand and is pulling her.  She still holds her
	flowers.  They run to a bus that is just closing its
	doors.

279	SHOT - BEN

	He bangs on the closed door of the bus.  The door opens.
	Ben climbs the step into the bus and pulls Elaine up
	after him.  The doors close.

	Ben holds out a dollar bill.

				BEN
		How much?

				DRIVER
		Where do you want to go?

				BEN
		To the end.

	The driver takes the bill and gives Ben some change.
	Ben turns and pulls Elaine along to the back of the bus.
	He pushes her into one of the seats and sits beside
	her.  Ben looks toward the front of the bus.

281	BEN'S POV

	He sees the driver and the passengers, all turned around
	in their seats and looking back at them.

282	SHOT - BEN

				BEN
		Let's go.  Let's get this bus
		moving!

283	SHOT - THE DRIVER

	He turns and starts the bus.

284	SHOT - BEN AND ELAINE

	They are breathing heavily.

				ELAINE
		Benjamin?

				BEN
		What?

	She takes his hand.

285	EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH - DAY

	Through the window in the back of the bus the church can
	be seen receding in the distance.  There seem to be a
	number of men dressed in black running around in the
	street in front of it.

                                         PROLOGUE

               Berlin.

               Season is March.

               Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.

               Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.

               Time: The Present.

                

               EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR

               Show general natural action of people going in and people 
               coming out but in it is the definite inference of people 
               arriving and people leaving the big hotel.

               MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA 
               PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and 
               hearing.

               DISSOLVE OUT.

               DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and 
               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business 
               jumble.

               CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the 
               steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it 
               passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.

               THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement 
               across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA 
               now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. 
               Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE 
               PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.

               At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who 
               emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish 
               who she is.

               THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear 
               her saying to Senf:

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam Grusinskaya will not want her 
                         car.

               This line is only just above the general clatter of action 
               but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- 
               and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going 
               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, 
               saying:

                                     VOICE
                         Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a 
               section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in 
               profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of 
               people drinking before their lunch.

               We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, 
               looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, 
               is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at 
               the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his 
               face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to 
               her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a 
               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at 
               his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA 
               and he moves out towards the lobby.

               BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the 
               main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of 
               waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A 
               string orchestra is playing.

               Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous 
               Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important 
               to a table.

               THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just 
               as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel 
               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:

                                     MAITRE D'HOTEL
                         Where is that gentleman's soup?

               The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to 
               argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to 
               another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:

                                     WAITER
                         Where's that soup?

               Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, 
               into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's 
               counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that 
               moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket 
               forward.

                                     BOY
                         Quick -- come on -- come on...

               The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception 
               of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll 
               slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over 
               a cauldron of soup.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small 
               cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and 
               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- 
               She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has 
               filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down 
               the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.

               THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. 
               Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette 
               carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A 
               horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, 
               he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to 
               tear the place down.

                                     WAITER
                              (anxious voice)
                         Yes.

                                     PREYSING
                              (grimly)
                         Cold.

                                     VOICE
                              (near Preysing's elbow)
                         Mr. Preysing...

                                     PREYSING
                              (in same voice)
                         Yes...

                                     BELLBOY
                         Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --

               Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- 
               He walks out through the door...

                                                     DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:

               Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA 
               TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.

               Bellboy is with Preysing.

                                     BELLBOY
                         Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his 
                         call.

                                     GIRL
                         Yes, Mr. Preysing --

               Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of 
               switchboard.

                                     GIRL
                              (nervously)
                         They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...

                                     PREYSING
                              (to boy)
                         You told me it was on -- you said 
                         the call was through.
                              (he waits irritably)

                                     SECOND GIRL
                              (to first)
                         Who's in number three?

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Senf -- the hall porter.
                              (Girl looks off at...)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH

                                     SENF
                         Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, 
                         Grand Hotel... Are you at the 
                         Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is 
                         she in pain?,... Isn't the child 
                         coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy 
                         for you to talk... Get away?,... No, 
                         I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's 
                         like being in jail. Oh, I hope the 
                         child comes along all right.

               At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT 
               BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from 
               desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:

                                     PREYSING
                         Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off 
                         the wire... No... I was talking to 
                         Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh... 
                         Hello!... Is that you dear?... How 
                         is everything at home?... What do 
                         you hear from the factory?... No... 
                         How are the children?... I left my 
                         shaving set at home... Yes, is your 
                         father there?... Hello, father?... 
                         Our stock has gone down twenty-three 
                         points. If our merger with the Saxonia 
                         doesn't go through -- I don't know 
                         what we can do... Hello, hello... 
                         yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything 
                         depends on Manchester... If they 
                         refuse to come in -- well, we will 
                         be in bad shape... no... Rely on me, 
                         I'll make it go through -- I'll make 
                         it go through... Waiting?... Yes, 
                         I'm still speaking...

               THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the 
               booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (starting to speak)
                         Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that, 
                         Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette... 
                         Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid... 
                         No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go 
                         to the rehearsal... No... Madam is 
                         in a terrible state, she didn't sleep 
                         all night -- She's very tired... No, 
                         I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't 
                         want to speak in front of her... I 
                         gave her a tablet of veronal... She's 
                         sleeping now... You had better come 
                         to the hotel, I'm afraid...

               PAN TO BARON just entering booth. He is lighting a cigarette. 
               (receiver down - trick)

                                     BARON
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron 
                         Gaigern himself. Where are you?,... 
                         Good... No -- first, I need money. I 
                         need it right now. I have to make a 
                         showing... That's my business. I 
                         hope to do it tonight... at the 
                         theatre or after the show... But 
                         money -- for the hotel bill, for 
                         tips... I don't need advice, I need 
                         money!... Now, listen...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Who is that, This is... Hello, 
                         hello!... Who is that... Heinrich? 
                         This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich. 
                         This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can 
                         you hear me?... I've got to speak 
                         very quickly. Every minute costs two 
                         marks ninety... What?... Otto 
                         Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin, 
                         staying at the best hotel, the Grand 
                         Hotel... No, don't you understand? I 
                         want to explain, but I must do so 
                         quickly, it costs so much. Please 
                         don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello! 
                         Listen! You know that will I made 
                         before my operation? I gave it to 
                         you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy 
                         it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin 
                         to see a great specialist about that 
                         old trouble of mine... It's pretty 
                         bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I 
                         can't live much longer.
                              (louder)
                         I haven't long to live! That's what's 
                         the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on 
                         the line? No, it isn't nice to be 
                         told a thing like that. All sorts of 
                         things run through your head. I am 
                         going to stay here in Berlin. I am 
                         never coming back to Fredersdorf. 
                         Never! I want to get something out 
                         of life, too. You plague, and bother, 
                         and save -- and all of a sudden you 
                         are dead. Heinrich... You don't say 
                         anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, 
                         do you understand, the most expensive 
                         hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a 
                         room here. The very best people stay 
                         here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I 
                         saw him -- not five minutes after I 
                         was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell 
                         him exactly what I think of him. 
                         Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all 
                         my savings; my life insurance, too; 
                         I cashed in all my policies, the 
                         sick benefit fund, the old age 
                         pension, the unemployment insurance, 
                         the burial fund and everything... 
                         What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. 
                         I have to hang up now. I have to pay 
                         three times overcharge. Just think, 
                         Heinrich! There's music here all day 
                         long. And in the evening, they go 
                         around in full dress... Yes, sometimes 
                         I have pain, but I can stand it. 
                         Everything is frightfully expensive 
                         here. You can imagine, the Grand 
                         Hotel... What? Time's up...

               Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor 
               approaching through Kringelein's booth. He is looking down 
               at something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         two marks ninety.

               Doctor passes Baron's booth next.

                                     BARON
                         Dangerous?... That's my business... 
                         I'll do it tonight -- ...I'll do it 
                         alone.

               Doctor passes Suzette's booth.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam is afraid -- she will never 
                         dance again -- there was no applause 
                         last night --

               Doctor passes Preysing's booth.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- the merger -- Manchester -- 
                         it is my business as much as yours -- 
                         we've already lost eighty-five 
                         thousand --

               Doctor passes Senf's booth.

                                     SENF
                         I'm on duty -- I can't leave the 
                         Grand Hotel -- it's like being in 
                         prison -- the baby --

               Doctor crosses to telephone operator:

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to operator)
                         Any calls?

                                     GIRL
                         No, Doctor.

               sign flashes on.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO: EXTERIOR HOTEL

               Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action. 
               Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi-
               mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc. -- These 
               types indicated.

               In the distance we hear music.

                                                      DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:

               YELLOWROOM - NEAR SHOT OF BAND

               This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in 
               the Yellow Room of the hotel.

               THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the 
               hour of the tea-dansant.

               As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality 
               the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- 
               he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --

               Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the 
               restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be 
               necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor 
               upstairs -- giving sense of distance.

               The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds 
               through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty 
               woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is 
               seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLORIST SHOP

               Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns 
               from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied 
               in ribbon.

                                     BARON
                         Good little girl -- nice ones?

                                     GIRL
                         Yes, Baron.

               The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he 
               leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LOBBY

               In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with 
               small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk.

               SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down. 
               Senf is busy.

               The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the 
               flower box -- he is good-natured and patient.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk -- as 
                              telephone bell rings)
                         Is that for me?

                                     CLERK
                         No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to 
                         be brought.

                              receiver)

                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
                         brought.

               Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door.

                                     BELLBOY'S VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be

                         Good evening, Baron.

                              (amiably)
                         Good evening. Will you send these up 
                         to Madam Grusinskaya?

                                     SENF
                         Yes, Baron.
                              (he hands the box of 
                              flowers to the clerk)
                         Madam Grusinskaya.

               Clerk hands box to bellboy.

                         Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya.

                                     SENF
                         Oh yes, Baron --

                         Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam 
                         Grusinskaya.

               Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up.

                              (to Clerk)

                              (at telephone -- shakes 
                              his head)
                         No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not 
                         to be brought.

                                     SENF
                              (to boy)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be 
                         brought.

               The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the 
               Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Charge them...

               As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly 
               as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently 
               from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (to Senf)
                         Good evening -- my key -- one sixty-
                         eight.

                                     BARON
                         Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Oh -- good evening, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         How's the beautiful lady?

                                     PIMENOV
                         Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the 
                         truth, Baron -- tonight we are a 
                         little bit nervous. Were you at the 
                         theatre last night?

                                     BARON
                         Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya 
                         dances.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Well -- last night was not so good.

                                     BARON
                         I thought she was splendid!

                                     PIMENOV
                         Yes -- but the audience.

               At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little 
               Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The 
               Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.

                                     CLERK
                              (to Japanese)
                         The parquot loges are behind the 
                         parquet chairs.

                                     JAPANESE
                         Then they've put me back and I want 
                         to be up in front. How is that, chairs 
                         in front of loges?

               Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.

                                     SENF
                         The train leaves at seven-thirty, 
                         Madam. That is the only through train -- 
                         the dining car goes along.

               The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese 
               speaks volubly to his wife.

                                     BARON
                              (sarcastically)
                         It's always so quiet here.

                                     PIMENOV
                         If you occupied the room next to 
                         Madam Grusinskaya, you would 
                         appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.

                                     BARON
                         My dear sir, I would gladly change 
                         rooms with you.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (effeminately)
                         No doubt you would, Baron. But do 
                         you know, I'm quite indispensable to 
                         her. I'm her ballet master and her 
                         nurse. I hardly belong to myself 
                         anymore. But, there you are, it's 
                         Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring 
                         her.

               At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Pardon me.
                              (addressing Senf)
                         Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor 
                         Zinnowitz.

                                     SENF
                              (to bellboy)
                         Mr. Preysing -- from Fredersdorf --

                                     BELLBOY
                              (quickly -- paging)
                         Mr. Preysing --

               Preysing steps quickly into scene.

                                     PREYSING
                         Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Have I kept you waiting?

                                     PREYSING
                         Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from 
                         Manchester.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         No news yet?

                                     PREYSING
                         No. No word.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Everything depends on the Manchester 
                         merger.

                                     PREYSING
                         I know -- I know.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as 
                         your lawyer I made it my business to 
                         broach the matter ---

               As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to 
               Senf.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I'm expecting a young woman -- a 
                         stenographer -- she will ask for Mr. 
                         Preysing. Ask her to wait.

                                     SENF
                         Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.

               As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk)
                         For me?

                                     CLERK
                         No -- letters to two-eighty.

                                     SENF
                              (to Clerk)
                         If a young woman, a stenographer, -- 
                         etc.

               This just covers the scene.

               The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them 
               has said which brings our attention to them again.

               At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Any letters?

                                     SENF
                         No, Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Telegrams?

                                     SENF
                         No, Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Anyone asked for me?

                                     SENF
                         Nobody, Doctor.

               The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with 
               his one hand.

                                     BARON
                              (glancing at Doctor)
                         The war.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (looking up from his 
                              letter -- glances 
                              off at the doctor)
                         That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You 
                         know him?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- He always seems to be waiting 
                         for something -- and nothing ever 
                         comes.

                                     PIMENOV
                         The war dropped him here and forgot 
                         him.

                                     BARON
                              (beams)
                         Yes, I was in the war.

               CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --

               He turns as he hears the Baron say this.

               He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... 
               then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get 
               Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception 
               desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Please -- please pay some attention 
                         to me -- I have no time.

               Pan back to desk:

                                     ROHNA
                              (engaged with a lady 
                              and gentleman, who 
                              have just arrived)
                         If you will wait one moment, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I 
                         waited three days before I got a 
                         room at all and what a room that is.

                                     ROHNA
                         It's a very nice room and inexpensive, 
                         sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Did I say I wanted a cheap room to 
                         live in -- when I came here did I 
                         ask for a cheap room? Did I?

               Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little 
               gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.

                                     ROHNA
                         Just one moment, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every 
                         day is precious -- every hour -- 
                         Every minute.

               Second Clerk is looking straight at him.

               Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and 
               proceeds:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I came here because I wanted to live 
                         here, two weeks, maybe three -- God 
                         only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- 
                         I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- 
                         I'm ill -- I can't wait.

               As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is 
               watching.

               Assistant Manager enters.

                                     ASSISTANT MANAGER
                         Has the gentleman a complaint?

               Rohna and Kringelein speak together.

                                     ROHNA
                         The gentleman is dissatisfied with 
                         room number five fifty-nine.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I certainly have a complaint -- and 
                         a fair one.

               He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov 
               enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The 
               bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and 
               looks up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (continuing)
                         I came here from a long distance to 
                         stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a 
                         room -- a big room -- like you would 
                         give General Director Preysing -- 
                         I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can 
                         pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you 
                         give him a little room, way up in 
                         the corner with the hot water pipes 
                         going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
                              (he bangs at the desk 
                              with his fist)

                                     DOCTOR
                         This gentleman can have my room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (turning)
                         Oh!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Send his bags up to my room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- but -- I --

                                     DOCTOR
                         You're tired. I can see that.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have 
                         been ill...

                                     DOCTOR
                         You are ill.

               During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna 
               quietly. The manager how turns.

                                     MANAGER
                         Mr. Kringelein will take room number 
                         one-seventy-six, one of our most 
                         expensive rooms. It is large and on 
                         the front with bath.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (subdued -- exhausted --)
                         Does that mean that the bath is my 
                         own? --- Private?

                                     MANAGER
                         Certainly, sir.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. 
                         That's what I want -- a large room 
                         on the front with a private bath -- 
                         Yes, that's what I want. I can pay 
                         now if you like.

               He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract 
               money.

                                     DOCTOR
                         That will not be necessary.

               The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to 
               the new room.

               Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has 
               noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.

               In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.

               Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his 
               sleeve.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     BARON
                              (amused)
                         Not at all, sir.
                              (he beams)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (finding a friendly 
                              face)
                         Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- 
                         from Fredersdorf.

                                     BARON
                         I'm Baron von Gaigern.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, a Baron!
                              (he is impressed)

               Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly 
               popular.

                                     BARON
                         And this is Doctor Otternschlag.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (turning to Doctor)
                         Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- 
                         I am --

                                     DOCTOR
                         I know -- I know -- when a man's 
                         collar is an inch too big for him -- 
                         I know he is ill.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
                              (his finger goes 
                              nervously to his 
                              collar)

               Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.

               At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where 
               he has bought the evening papers.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         Is this gentleman a Baron, too?

                                     PIMENOV
                              (laughing)
                         Unfortunately no.

               The Manager comes into scene.

                                     MANAGER
                         Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Again?

                                     MANAGER
                         Please.

               Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.

               At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Have you a minute now?

                                     BARON
                         No -- I told you not to come in this 
                         lobby.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Time's getting short.

                                     BARON
                         I've told you a hundred times not to 
                         speak to me with a cigarette in your 
                         mouth.

               Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still 
               holds it in his hand.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         I want to speak --

                                     BARON
                         Not now.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Yes, sir.

               The Baron leaves.

               General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, 
               Kringelein and the Doctor.

               SENF'S DESK

               On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in 
               Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (we hear her ask)
                         Mr. Preysing.

                                     SENF
                         Will you wait please.

                                     CLERK
                         The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. 
                         Preysing telephoned.

                                     SENF
                         Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Thanks --
                              (calling off to 
                              elevator)
                         Heigh! -- Wait!

               She crosses to elevator.

               THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR 
               WITH HER.

               As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns 
               around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking 
               down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see 
               on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.

               NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.

               The lift ascends.

               UPPER CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for 
               the numbers. She moves out of scene.

               The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move 
               straight down the hall.

               Pimenov is chatting volubly.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (to Baron)
                         Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she 
                         receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, 
                         trains, hotels -- hotels, trains 
                         theatre.

               We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. 
               Preysing's room.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (continuing)
                         I must go and dress -- she'll be 
                         waking up and calling for me.

               He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of 
               his ballet.

               At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to 
               Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there 
               is an amusing exchange of glances between them.

               Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.

                                     PREYSING'S VOICE
                         Come in.

               She opens the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He 
               stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.

               He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him 
               very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.

                                     PREYSING
                         What...! --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'm the stenographer.

                                     PREYSING
                         Then you will please wait outside.

               He is very much affronted.

               Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the 
               altogether --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (lightly)
                         Don't hurry -- take your time.

               She goes out of the room and shuts the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               UPPER CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room.

               Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron 
               approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that 
               Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues 
               whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: 
               "Are you mad?"

                                     BARON
                         Like dancing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Not with strangers.

               Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is 
               going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to 
               keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes 
               out.

                                     BARON
                              (turning to Flaemmchen)
                         Never?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a fool!

                                     BARON
                         Yes, I am rather.

               He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets.

               She glances impatiently at her watch.

                                     BARON
                         He must be very nice.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Who?

                                     BARON
                              (gallantly)
                         Whoever is keeping you waiting.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (indicating Preysing's 
                              door)
                         Have you seen it?

                                     BARON
                         Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- 
                         really? That?
                              (indicating Preysing's 
                              door)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That.

                                     BARON
                              (with meaning)
                         You?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quickly)
                         Oh -- work!!

                                     BARON
                              (with meaning)
                         Oh!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Dictation.
                              (she twittles her 
                              fingers)
                         You know...

                                     BARON
                         Oh... poor child. If you were free, 
                         I'd ask you to come and have some 
                         tea -- but --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Tea would spoil my dinner.
                              (lightly)
                         One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil 
                         it.

                                     BARON
                         Reducing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (she turns invitingly)
                         No -- why? -- should I?

                                     BARON
                         Lord no -- charming -- but why one 
                         meal a day?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (laughing in his face)
                         Money -- Ever heard of it?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are 
                         a...
                              (moves fingers)
                         ...a stenographer. Don't little 
                         stenographers earn little pennies?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Very little.

                                     BARON
                         Too bad.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Did you ever see a stenographer with 
                         a decent frock on? -- One that she'd 
                         bought herself?

                                     BARON
                         Poor child --
                              (enthusiastically)
                         I wish I were free tonight -- we 
                         could --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (with invitation)
                         Aren't you?

                                     BARON
                              (quickly)
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Free --

                                     BARON
                              (glancing up passage)
                         Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow 
                         though.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?

                                     BARON
                         Shall we say five o'clock -- 
                         downstairs?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Where downstairs?

                                     BARON
                         Yellow Room where they dance --
                              (business)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're very funny --

                                     BARON
                              (with great meaning)
                         Yes? -- Tomorrow?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Of course.

                                     BARON
                         Really?

               Flaemmchen laughs at him.

                                     BARON
                         We'll dance.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (slowly)
                         All right. We'll dance.

               At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his 
               doorway at the end of the passage.

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Baron -- Oh, Baron!

               The Baron turns and looks off at ---

               KRINGELEIN

               Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He 
               waves.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         If I could trouble the Baron to come 
                         and see this beautiful room. I have 
                         ordered champagne. Perhaps the 
                         Baroness could join us.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!
                              (to Baron and 
                              Flaemmchen)
                         We are having caviar -- it's expensive 
                         but that makes no difference -- I 
                         see the Baroness is laughing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Have caviar if you like, but it tastes 
                         like herring to me.

               At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette 
               comes out into the hall.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh!

               By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The 
               Baron turns back for a moment.

                                     BARON
                              (calling back quietly 
                              to Suzette)
                         Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!

               Suzette turns back into the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are 
               drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of 
               silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow 
               Room below.

               In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers 
               which she has been mending.

               She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly 
               and looks off dramatically at...

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, 
               on the chaise-lounge.

               Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand 
               which is outside the robe moves.

               The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards 
               Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the 
               chaise-lounge and is looking down.

               Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling 
               and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                              (quietly and reverently -- 
                              almost a whisper)
                         Madam has slept well.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No, I have been awake -- thinking -- 
                         thinking.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                         It is time for the performance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The performance?

                                     SUZETTE
                         It is time.

               Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly 
               upright --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Always the performance -- every day 
                         the performance -- time for the 
                         performance.
                              (she pauses and droops 
                              suddenly)
                         I think, Suzette, I have never been 
                         so tired in my life.
                              (she takes the bottle 
                              of veronal which is 
                              nearby)
                         Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
                              (laughs a little)

                                     SUZETTE
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be 
                         brought.

               While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of 
               a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to 
               the floor and although there is only one other woman in the 
               room -- she holds the robe around her.

               She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her 
               fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes 
               and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.

               There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.

               Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the 
               case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.

               Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.

               Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. 
               Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I can't dance tonight --

                                     SUZETTE
                         It will pass -- it will pass -- come.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Let us cancel the engagement.

                                     SUZETTE
                         But, Madam. cannot do that.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Now is the time to cancel to stop 
                         entirely. I feel it -- everything 
                         tells me -- enough -- enough.

               She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands 
               unconsciously touch the pearls.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (very quietly)
                         The peals are cold -- everything is 
                         cold -- finished -- it seems so far 
                         away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- 
                         St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- 
                         the Grand Duke Sergei --
                              (long pause as though 
                              she were reliving 
                              incidents of the 
                              past)
                         -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- 
                         it's all gone.

               She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they 
                         were to break --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The pearls won't break -- they hold 
                         together and bring me bad luck ---- 
                         I hate them!

               Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- 
                         I think perhaps they are from the 
                         same young man -- he is at the end 
                         of the corridor -- tall -- he walks 
                         like a soldier -- Madam must have 
                         noticed how often he is in the 
                         elevator with us. Last night for 
                         instance --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- 
                         quiet.

               Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away 
               in Russia -- she does not look --

               Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Send it away -- I shan't need it.

               There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Come in.

               She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. 
               Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. 
               As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak 
               into telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (authoritatively)
                         Madam Grusinskaya will not require 
                         her car -- no -- she will not be 
                         going to the theatre.
                              (she turns)

               Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will 
               deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.

               She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing-
               table and sits.

                                     PIMENOV
                         It is time for the performance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (under her breath)
                         The performance -- the performance -- 
                         the performance.
                              (during this scene 
                              the orchids fall to 
                              the floor)

               It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just 
               temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very 
               near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with 
               her a revulsion against the word performance.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (tenderly -- as he 
                              touches her shoulder 
                              gently)
                         Poor little Lisevata -- she still 
                         has her stage frights -- it will 
                         pass.

               Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he 
               attempts to soothe her.

               Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         It is not stage fright -- it's 
                         something more --

                                     PIMENOV
                              (tenderly)
                         What -- what is it? Last night...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Last night?... There was no applause.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (quickly)
                         There was -- there was.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         That theatre -- half empty -- dancing 
                         for those few -- I was frantic -- I 
                         finished -- the last beat and...
                              (she reclines her 
                              head as the swan 
                              finishing the dance)
                         ...I waited -- I listened -- but the 
                         applause didn't come -- nothing. A 
                         man in the box -- and just the claques 
                         behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We 
                         are dead -- it's finished.

               There is a sudden knocking at the door.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Meierheim --

               The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         What is this that you have cancelled 
                         your car? Who am I that I should 
                         wait like a fool at the door? And 
                         here on a whim, you cancel your car. 
                         Have you forgotten there is a 
                         performance? Do you know the time? 
                         Or, are we all mad? Am I your 
                         manager?... Have we a contract? Have 
                         we obligations? Am I blind?
                              (glances at his watch)
                         ...Or is that the time?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'm cancelling the engagement.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Oh!

               Business of Pimenov signaling to him.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Oh! Madam is cancelling the 
                         engagement. Madam has chosen a funny 
                         time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, 
                         ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- 
                         there's a line in front of the theatre 
                         since six o'clock. The house is jammed 
                         to the roof.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The house is not full -- Is it really 
                         full?

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get 
                         dressed. And what an audience -- the 
                         French Ambassador -- American 
                         Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- 
                         er -- er --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to Suzette)
                         Oh -- but it can't be.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
                              (she holds up her 
                              frock)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (changed mood)
                         All right, Suzette -- quickly -- 
                         hurry.

                                     PIMENOV
                         We will wait.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You are late. Hurry.

               Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and 
               says:

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur 
                         to bring the car.

               Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BY ELEVATOR

               Pimenov and Meierheim.

               Meierheim is pushing the bell.

                                     PIMENOV
                         How is the house?

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Terrible. After this, no more ballets 
                         for me. Jazz --
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         Just jazz.

                                     PIMENOV
                         If the house is empty again, I don't 
                         know --

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         When she gets her paint on and hears 
                         the music -- she'll be all right. I 
                         know these people.

               They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing 
               rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost 
               together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA 
               PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE 
               ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, 
               smoke, etc.

               In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, 
               and a very fat waiter -- comedian.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You may laugh. Caviar and champagne 
                         may mean nothing to you, but to me -- 
                         they mean a great deal. You see, I'm 
                         ill and all of a sudden I got a fear 
                         of missing life. I don't want to 
                         miss life -- do you understand?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You are funny. You speak of life as 
                         if it were a train you wanted to 
                         catch.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- and for me, it's going to 
                         leave at any minute. Let's drink.

               The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes 
               her head.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm sure this beautiful room must 
                         appeal to your taste -- distinctive, 
                         don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 
                         'A-number one'. I'm in the textile 
                         trade and I know.
                              (he has a slight case 
                              of hiccups from the 
                              champagne. He touches 
                              the drapes)
                         And these are real silk drapes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (amusedly)
                         Silk -- think of that -- silk -- 
                         they are, too.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (who hasn't stopped 
                              talking)
                         Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot 
                         and cold running water -- You see, I 
                         can get a bath whenever I like.

               At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor 
               Clerk.

                                     PREYSING
                         The stenographer!

               Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently 
               through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Her master's voice!
                              (turns to Baron)
                         I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, don't go.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'm engaged for the evening.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, can anyone engage you for the 
                         evening?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --
                              (to Baron)
                         Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five 
                         o'clock.
                              (she is moving out)

               Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands 
               looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as 
               though years had returned to him.

                                     BARON
                         What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to himself)
                         General Director Preysing!
                              (possibly he turns to 
                              Baron)
                         Baron, when I was sixteen years old, 
                         I started as an office boy in that 
                         man's factory --

                                     BARON
                         Then you know him?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do I know him -- I know him through 
                         and through.

               They start to leave. Oh, gentlemen, please don't go.

                                     BARON
                         I must -- I hope to see you again, 
                         Mr. Kringelein.

               Baron leaves.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You will stay, Doctor -- if you have 
                         nothing better to do?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I have nothing better to do, Mr. 
                         Kringelein.

               They move into the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NO SCENES: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script.

               NEAR ELEVATOR

               Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there.

               Meierheim is pushing the elevator button.

               The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man. 
               He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in 
               the distance.

               Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down 
               the corridor, followed by Suzette.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON, PIMENOV AND MEIERHEIM

                                     BARON
                         Perhaps you could present me now, 
                         Mr. Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not 
                         now -- here she is.

               Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.

               The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a 
               glance at her.

               They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her 
               characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first 
               time they have met in the picture.

               She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she 
               turns to Suzette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         My coat.

               Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes 
               the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel 
               case.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette -- I told you not to bring 
                         the pearls. I will not wear them 
                         tonight.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Why not?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Take them back, Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You haven't time.

               Suzette hesitates.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hurry, Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Such nonsense.

               Suzette toddles off with the pearls.

               The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the 
               Baron and descends.

               FLASH IN

               A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.

               FLASH IN

               A shot of the reverse of him looking down.

               The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in 
               his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.

               HOTEL LOBBY - FROM ELEVATORS

               Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise, 
               confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit 
               Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other 
               people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the 
               great Grusinskaya.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                              (off scene)
                         The car for Madam Grusinskaya.

               The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to 
               be echoed through the lobby.

               People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the 
               attention she is getting.

               THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she 
               sweeps outside of the hotel.

               The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go. 
               He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON

               As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She 
               is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs.

               IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#1"

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.

                                     PREYSING
                         No news from Manchester yet -- Do 
                         you think we ought to postpone the 
                         conference?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Good heavens no. That'd create the 
                         very worst impression. You must be 
                         optimistic. You must convince them. 
                         You know as well as I do that the 
                         merger must go through.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- the merger must go through -- 
                         But I am used to making my deals on 
                         a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am 
                         an honest business man -- a good 
                         husband and father -- I have a sense 
                         of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. 
                         I couldn't live happily otherwise.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well, don't get excited about it. We 
                         agreed that the merger with the 
                         Saxonia people must go through.

                                     PREYSING
                         I want to dictate my statement for 
                         tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. 
                         I like to have things down before me 
                         in black and white.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I'll see you in the morning then, at 
                         the conference. Everything'll be all 
                         right, Preysing... Don't worry. 
                         Goodnight.

                                     PREYSING
                         Good night.

               Zinnowitz leaves.

               FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM

               We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the 
               typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that 
               Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind 
               his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an 
               odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.

                                     PREYSING'S VOICE
                         Both parties have fully agreed that 
                         this merger can result only in mutual 
                         advantages.

               Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's 
               room.

               The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse.

               Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides 
               forward As he strides he says:

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (repeating)
                         Moreover --

               Preysing paces the room.

                                     PREYSING
                              (repeating)
                         Moreover --
                              (he pauses, thinking. 
                              Picks up telephone 
                              quickly -- into 
                              telephone)
                         Is there a telegram for me yet?... 
                         Oh -- when it does, send it up.

               During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her 
               fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist-
               watch.

               Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.

                                     PREYSING
                         Now, where was I?
                              (he looks over the 
                              sheet in her 
                              typewriter -- 
                              accidentally his arm 
                              touches her neck)
                         Oh -- sorry.
                              (he puts his cigar in 
                              his mouth and walks 
                              away. As he walks 
                              away)
                         Where was I?

               As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as 
               she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking 
               down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at 
               attention.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover...

               It seems a silly kind of lull.

                                     PREYSING
                         Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' 
                         office?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         No -- only occasional jobs.
                              (she yawns suddenly)

                                     PREYSING
                         Tired?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You pay me.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're a very unusual stenographer --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover...
                              (as he paces the room, 
                              it is obvious that 
                              he is trying to 
                              collect his thoughts)

               She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins 
               characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I don't see why it's unusual for a 
                         stenographer to be pretty -- if she 
                         does her work well, -- seems so silly. 
                         I don't know why they don't like 
                         girls like me in offices. Personally, 
                         I hate offices -- I'd much rather be 
                         in the movies.

                                     PREYSING
                         Movies?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes, I photograph very well. Look --

               She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to 
               him.

               He looks down at it without touching it.

                                     PREYSING
                         What is this?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I got ten marks for that.

               He picks it up.

                                     PREYSING
                         You...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (without looking up)
                         Me.

               As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes.

                                     PREYSING
                         You...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Moreover...

                                     PREYSING
                              (quickly)
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.

                                     PREYSING
                         What brown hands you have.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That's from skiing.

                                     PREYSING
                         Skiing?
                              (he holds her hands)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (natural -- unabashed)
                         Yes... A man I know took me to 
                         Switzerland last month...

               He drops her hand suddenly.

                                     PREYSING
                         A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That 
                         must have been nice -- for him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (reading)
                         Only in mutual advantages -- 
                         moreover...

               Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to 
               the work in hand.

                                     PREYSING
                         Moreover... He was a lucky man -- 
                         that man.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Perhaps.
                              (she waits at attention)

               He paces back and forth again.

                                     PREYSING
                         Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married 
                         man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?
                              (she takes cigarette)
                         I went to Florence once, too.

                                     PREYSING
                         With the same friend?

               By this time she is smoking her cigarette.

                              (without looking at 
                              him)
                         No.

                         successful termination of negotiations 
                         now pending with the Manchester Cotton

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Not too quickly.

                                     PREYSING
                         What?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a little too fast.

                                     PREYSING
                         Can't you understand me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I understand you perfectly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Have you got it now?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (typing)
                         Cotton Company --

                                     PREYSING
                         Should throw a great weight into the 
                         balance...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (as he turns his back 
                              looks at him 
                              significantly)
                         ...weight into the balance...

               There is a sudden knock at the door.

                                     PREYSING
                         Come in.

               Boy enters with telegram.

                                     BOY
                         Telegram for Mr. Preysing.

               With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- 
               opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose.

               IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

               it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh -- oh.
                              (he throws the telegram 
                              away from him, onto 
                              her desk. Paces the 
                              room.)

               Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she 
               must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Deal with Manchester Cotton Company 
                         definitely off.

               Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Sorry.

               Preysing paces the room with the telegram.

               Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at 
               the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         How nice -- your daughters?

                                     PREYSING
                         My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
                              (he is talking more 
                              to himself)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Is that Mrs. Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                              (to himself)
                         Definitely off.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
                              (she is looking at 
                              picture of Mrs. 
                              Preysing)

                                     PREYSING
                              (turns, speaks quickly -- 
                              definitely)
                         That'll be all -- be here tomorrow 
                         at nine o'clock.
                              (he turns, goes out 
                              onto balcony with 
                              telegram)

               Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up 
               her papers and is prepared to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASH OF CORRIDOR

               Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to 
               elevator.

               At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's 
               chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                              (calling)
                         Come in!

               Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room.

               BARON'S ROOM

               Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he 
               closes the door behind him and stands there with an 
               inquisitive look.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You are late -- the dancer's gone to 
                         the theatre.

                                     BARON
                              (very nonchalantly)
                         Well?

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         She's gone to the theatre -- don't 
                         you know?

                                     BARON
                              (very nonchalantly)
                         Yes.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (ready to explode)
                         And what are you going to do?

                                     BARON
                         The pearls are in her room.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (threateningly)
                         Now listen to me. The others are 
                         getting suspicious of you. I was on 
                         the telephone to Amsterdam today, 
                         they think you're scared.

                                     BARON
                         I've been careful, I've been waiting 
                         my chance.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You've been waiting your chance. 
                         You're too much of a gentleman -- 
                         that's the trouble with you.

                                     BARON
                         I told you I'll get the pearls 
                         tonight.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Need any help?

                                     BARON
                         No.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Have you got that skeleton key?

               He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it 
               to the Baron.

                                     BARON
                         No --

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         The floor clerk is out there in the 
                         corridor -- she sees everything ---

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (contemptuously)
                         I could take care of her.

                                     BARON
                         How?

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Chloroform on a handkerchief from 
                         behind -- while you...

                                     BARON
                         No -- no -- no -- no...

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         Poor girl -- chloroform would give 
                         her a rotten headache... I know -- I 
                         had it in the war. Besides, she's 
                         very pretty -- not young but --

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You're no good for this business. 
                         It's just a joke to you...

                                     BARON
                              (swings suddenly on 
                              him)
                         I don't like your tone.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (comes up to him -- 
                              face to face)
                         No --

               Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists 
               his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.

                                     BARON
                         Get out and leave it to me... be 
                         ready to leave on the night train 
                         for Amsterdam...

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         With the pearls?

                                     BARON
                         With the pearls --

               The Chauffeur leaves.

               The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad 
               lib.

               Crosses to window.

               FACADE OF HOTEL

               The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He 
               proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is 
               apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.

               Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               Baron is pretty shaken by jump.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite.

               Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing 
               coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud 
               speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:

                                     LOUD SPEAKER
                         'You are listening to the music of 
                         the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous 
                         Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls 
               in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:

               Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud 
               speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene 
               bullying waiter.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's 
               balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.

               Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is 
               locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers 
               refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd 
               way.

               As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off 
               of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the 
               operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's 
               room.

               He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger 
               prints off with his handkerchief.

               He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring 
               suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want 
               to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. 
               Crosses to the door again.

               Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's 
               voice singing an absurd song.

               He listens. She is coming in.

               The key turns in the door.

               Quickly he hides behind the curtains.

               Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, 
               enters the room.

               He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. 
               After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. 
               We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.

               The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear 
               from Preysing's radio.

               The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer 
               it but continues her duties.

               At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it 
               up and speaks.

                                     CHAMBERMAID
                         No -- no -- there is no one here.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears 
               at the open door.

                                     INSPECTRESS
                              (to Chambermaid)
                         You're late... What have you been 
                         doing?

                                     CHAMBERMAID
                              (grumbling)
                         Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come 
                         back - come back.' They won't get 
                         out of their rooms.

               The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around 
               the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking 
               at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking 
               for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it 
               is locked.

               Telephone bell rings again.

               Inspectress picks it up quickly.

                                     INSPECTRESS
                         No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... 
                         The Western Theater?... No...

               Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.

               Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.

                                     SUZETTE'S VOICE
                         Have you seen Madame?

                                     CLERK'S VOICE
                              (replying)
                         Isn't she at the theatre?

               Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... 
                         Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... 
                         No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at 
                         the hotel.

               INTERCUT

               With the Baron watching.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY

               During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid 
               out of the room. Business ad lib.

               Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the 
               telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                              (into telephone)
                         Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, 
                         I haven't found her. Is Desprez 
                         dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all 
                         right. Keep the show going.
                              (bangs down receiver)
                         Wait till I see her, she'll pay for 
                         this -- this little trick is going 
                         to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach 
                         of contract.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madame is ill -- her nerves...

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Her nerves... What about my nerves?... 
                         Who is she anyway? Where does she 
                         think she is -- Russia? Those days 
                         have passed.

               He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is 
               in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one 
               shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into 
               the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, 
               make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madame --

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Well?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

               The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to 
               pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Where have you been?

                                     SUZETTE
                         Should I -- Does madame wish...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette, please go, I want to be 
                         alone.

               Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, 
               waiting for Meierheim.

               Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         I suppose I can cancel the Vienna 
                         engagement.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I wish to be alone.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         You'll be very much alone, my dear 
                         madame. This is the end.
                              (he stamps out)

               Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it 
               on Meierheim's exit.

               DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.

               It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to 
               door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and 
               throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses 
               slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the 
               strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.

               Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.

               FLASH OF BARON

               Watching her.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. 
               Then she becomes weary again.

               With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the 
               curtain -- where the Baron is standing.

               BARON

               We see him tense himself.

               GRUSINSKAYA

               She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out 
               of scene.

               CLOSEUP OF BARON

               He peeps around the curtains.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA

               She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks 
               steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her 
               hands and we hear her say:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The end -- over -- finished --

               Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.

               Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across 
               the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and 
               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.

               She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, 
               places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are 
               quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- 
               asks for the theatre.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The Western Theatre --

               She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- 
               stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to 
               telephone speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Western Theatre?

               She glances up at the clock.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet 
                         master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- 
                         hurry.

               Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she 
               commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. 
               Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.

               She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into 
               the telephone --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. 
                         I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... 
                         No, no don't --
                              (long pause)
                         ...Just alone... Good night, good 
                         night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, 
                         how is it going, badly?... Uh?... 
                         Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- 
                         and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- 
                         they didn't miss me?... They didn't 
                         miss me.
                              (she lets her hand 
                              drop with the receiver 
                              and goes on talking 
                              into the air)
                         They didn't miss me -- good night, 
                         Pimenov...

               She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in 
               her hand, unreplaced.

               The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind 
               her the Baron peers from the closet.

               Her head sinks down upon her hands.

               A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts 
               the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice 
               of Opehlia, she speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (with great humility)
                         Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have 
                         finished.
                              (she replaces the 
                              receiver)

               The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It 
               is in fact, ballet.

               Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. 
               She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the 
               table, or hangs it over the telephone.

               She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the 
               Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.

               We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. 
               "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses 
               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. 
               She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. 
               She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.

               She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded 
               hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.

               The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he 
               looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for 
               the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his 
               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.

               It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.

               At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his 
               hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her 
               bed.

               She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer 
               who has heard something, then reassured. She places the 
               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is 
               quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her 
               head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal 
               and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away 
               upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance 
               herself.

               The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to 
               the bedside noiselessly and stands there.

               She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the 
               glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.

               She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the 
               floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal 
               falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a 
               sitting position.

                                     BARON
                         Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.

               She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be 
               coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the 
               bed.

                                     BARON
                         Careful -- there's broken glass on 
                         the floor.

               Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her 
               kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse 
               of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she 
               is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be 
               a silly movement.

                                     BARON
                         There.
                              (takes a pillow from 
                              the bed throws it 
                              upon the floor over 
                              the glass, steps 
                              back)

               She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which 
               was lying across the back of a chair.

               Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She 
               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron 
               puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances 
               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this 
               man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense 
               of relief with her. She is trembling.

               The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his 
               danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand 
               marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she 
               will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He 
               could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or 
               silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating 
               sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)

                                     BARON
                         Please do not be frightened, Madam.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (after a silence)
                         What do you want here?

                                     BARON
                         Nothing -- only to be here.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you hide in my room?

                                     BARON
                         But surely you must know -- because 
                         I love you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Because you love me -- you love me?

               She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she 
               throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more 
               passionately.

                                     BARON
                              (going over to her)
                         Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do 
                         you good to cry? Are you afraid? 
                         Shall I go?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I was so alone -- always alone -- 
                         and suddenly you were there and said 
                         that.
                              (sitting up)
                         No. I am not afraid. It is strange.

                                     BARON
                         Don't cry -- it tears my heart to 
                         see you sob like that.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (regaining control)
                         Nerves -- just nerves. You must 
                         forgive me. I have had a bad evening. 
                         I am very tired. Do you know what it 
                         is to be tired -- tired of a routine 
                         existence?

                                     BARON
                         I'm afraid not -- I usually do just 
                         what I feel like doing at the moment.

               A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the 
               situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her 
               robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial 
               Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She 
               sweeps across the room.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         So you feel like coming into a lady's 
                         room -- and you come... What now?

                                     BARON
                              (following her)
                         I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Certainly.

               She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds 
               it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you look at me like that?

                                     BARON
                         I did not know you were so 
                         beautiful... and --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (bitterly)
                         And then --?

                                     BARON
                         No irony. You're so appealing -- so 
                         soft -- so tired. I feel like taking 
                         you in my arms and not letting 
                         anything more happen to you -- ever.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (involuntarily closing 
                              her eyes)
                         And -- and --

                                     BARON
                         How tired you are!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- tired...

                                     BARON
                         So alone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Alone. All alone.
                              (whispers in Russian)
                         Oh, you strange -- strange creature.

                                     BARON
                         You mustn't talk Russian to me.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Strange man...

                                     BARON
                         Am I quite strange to you?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Not quite strange now. It is as if I 
                         had been expecting you. You know, 
                         once when the Grand Duke was alive, 
                         I found a man hiding in my room -- a 
                         young officer --

                                     BARON
                         And...?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         He disappeared. Later he was found 
                         dead.

                                     BARON
                         I never knew it was so dangerous to 
                         hide in a woman's room when she's 
                         alone.
                              (he embraces her)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Go away. Who are you --?

                                     BARON
                         A man who could love -- that is all, 
                         who has forgotten everything else 
                         for you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You could love me. It is so long 
                         since I have heard that word. Nobody 
                         has loved me for a long time. It is 
                         so icy-cold to be famous. One is so 
                         cruelly alone. How is it that you -- 
                         Let me look at you. Your hands. Your 
                         eyes. Why could you love me?

                                     BARON
                         I saw you just now -- then I saw you 
                         cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- 
                         Grusinskaya...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew 
                         how I slaved and slaved for 
                         Grusinskaya -- for the success of 
                         Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of 
                         Grusinskaya... and what is she now? 
                         Just someone who has found that on 
                         the day success ceases life ceases -- 
                         Are you listening to me -- Do you 
                         understand? -- I want you to 
                         understand.

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- I do understand.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I think you must go now -- the key 
                         is on the floor.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going -- You know I'm not 
                         going -- Let me stay here?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

                                     BARON
                         That is not so -- you don't want to 
                         be alone.
                              (he looks back at the 
                              bed as if remembering 
                              the suicide.)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone --

                                     BARON
                         No -- You don't want to be alone at 
                         all -- You were in despair before -- 
                         If I left you, you'd feel worse than 
                         you did before, You must not be alone -- 
                         You mustn't cry -- you must forget... 
                         Tell me that I can stay with you -- 
                         tell me.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (whispering)
                         Just for a minute then.

               Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --

                                     BARON
                         What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.

               She whispers.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You -- man...

               The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She 
               has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting 
               and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.

               (NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)

               She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. 
               She can't find the other.

               Business as he gets other slipper for her.

               He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Thank you -- you are gallant.
                              (she turns, her mood 
                              has changed)
                         What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya 
                         weeping is a sight worth seeing. It 
                         is many years since she did such a 
                         thing... You frightened me -- badly. 
                         You're responsible for this -- painful 
                         scene.

               He watches her.

               The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating 
               warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, 
               volubly.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         The stage frays one's nerves... the 
                         discipline -- it's so exacting. 
                         Discipline means doing what you don't 
                         want to do and take no pleasure in 
                         doing. Do you know what I mean? Have 
                         you ever experienced the weariness 
                         that comes from discipline?

                                     BARON
                         I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take 
                         pleasure in doing.

               Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I see -- you do only what you take 
                         pleasure in doing. You take pleasure 
                         in coming into a woman's bedroom and 
                         you come. You take pleasure in a 
                         dangerous climb onto a balcony, so 
                         you do it... And what is your pleasure 
                         now?

                                     BARON
                              (naive as he says 
                              frankly)
                         I should like to smoke.

               She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes 
               her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing 
               table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds 
               out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches 
               him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale 
               the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. 
               She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks 
               into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to 
               live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you smile?

                                     BARON
                         Because I can see something in the 
                         mirror that you cannot. My dear --
                              (he pauses suddenly)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What can you see?

                                     BARON
                         You are beautiful!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No.

                                     BARON
                         Beautiful but so sad. I did not know 
                         it was so dangerous to look into a 
                         woman's bedroom.

               Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses 
               it. A long tender and sincere embrace.

               Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his 
               whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages 
               herself.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I think you had better go now. The 
                         key is on the floor.

               He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going... You know that I'm 
                         not going... Do you think I could 
                         leave you alone here? After that --?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What?

                                     BARON
                         The veronal -- you. I'm going to 
                         stay here with you.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I want to be alone.

                                     BARON
                         That is not the truth.
                              (he catches her wrists)
                         You do not want to be alone -- you're 
                         afraid of being alone -- I know you're 
                         afraid. I know you. You were 
                         desperate, just now, if I go away 
                         you'll be more desperate than ever. 
                         Say I am to stay with you... say it.
                              (he almost shakes her)

               Her head falls slowly on his breast.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (whispers)
                         For just a minute then.
                              (she pulls away, 
                              crosses the room, 
                              quickly to the door, 
                              with almost a cry. 
                              She looks around for 
                              the key to the door)
                         No -- oh, no!

               He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.

                                     BARON
                         Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --

               Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.

               FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN

               approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.

               They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's 
               room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is 
               characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A 
               distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for 
               the first time by alcohol.

               Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon 
               his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.

               THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because 
               the Doctor has paused at the door.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. 
                         To live -- to live -- in the Grand 
                         Hotel.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (with a deprecating 
                              gesture)
                         The Grand Hotel.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the 
                         champagne -- girls when they dance -- 
                         all the shining ice in those big 
                         silver things -- That's life --

                                     DOCTOR
                         Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are 
                         drunk -- good night.
                              (he leaves)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         But Doctor --

               But the Doctor has gone.

               Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the 
               mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.

               He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. 
               Imitating the doctor, he repeats:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- 
                         good night.

               He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.

               He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the 
               carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm 
               and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass 
               and some water which he sees standing on the night table by 
               his bed.

               He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with 
               water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine 
               bottles.

               His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.

               He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- 
               his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.

               He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops 
               into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden 
               impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine 
               away.

               With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song 
               that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid 
               song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters 
               around the room, undressing.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE

               His voice is still heard in the passage.

               Rows of shoes outside the doors. The dozing night clerk hears 
               the voice and looks up, startled.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO A WATCHMAN

               with his clock, hears the voice.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO A CORNER OF DOCTOR'S ROOM

               He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on. He looks up 
               suddenly, hearing the voice.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO PREYSING'S ROOM

               He is snoring. The distant voice disturbs him. He turns in 
               his sleep.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               A beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows.

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I've never been as happy.

                                     GRU'S VOICE
                         What did you say?

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I've never been as happy!

                                     GRUSINSKAYA'S VOICE
                         Say it again -- say it!

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         I have never been so happy!

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               He is now dressed in an absurd night dress. He crosses to 
               the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great 
               pillows. His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light. He 
               might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh.

               DISTANT CLOCK CHIMES.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#2"

                                      SEQUENCE "#3"

               FADE IN:

               TELEPHONE ROOM

               It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight 
               girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written)

               We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE 
               GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.

                                     GIRL ONE
                         Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no, 
                         Baron von Gaigern's room does not 
                         answer... Yes,... all right... Baron 
                         von Gaigern's chauffeur calling.

               CAMERA PANS TO:

                                     GIRL THREE
                         Good morning, nine-thirty Doctor 
                         Otternschlag... No, Doctor, no 
                         messages... No, Doctor.

               CAMERA PANS TO:

                                     GIRL FIVE
                         Grand Hotel -- good morning... who 
                         is calling Madam Grusinskaya?... Oh, 
                         Mr. Pimenov. Madam Grusinskaya is 
                         not to be disturbed, sir... no, sir... 
                         yes, sir --

               The word passes down repeated.

                                     VOICE
                         Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty 
                         two for today.

                         -- good morning... Mr. Preysing --
                              (she plugs through)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               Telephone bell ringing.

               General shot.

               Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel 
               for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table, 
               smoking and waiting.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (glances at watch)
                         Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us 
                         waiting.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (who has returned)
                         He likes to play the great man.

                                     WAITZ
                              (glancing at market 
                              report from table)
                         The Preysing stock is holding its 
                         own today on the market.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         Ask Preysing what it's costing him 
                         to keep it up.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         And ask me what it's costing us to 
                         hammer it down.

                                     WAITZ
                         Exactly.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         If the Preysing people get the 
                         Manchester contract, we shall 
                         certainly merge with the Preysing 
                         company -- but if they haven't they're 
                         ruined -- Preysing will have to 
                         declare himself.

                                     WAITZ
                         Shhh -- here he is now.

               The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably 
               surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (beams)
                         Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr. 
                         Preysing will be here in a minute.

               Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen.

               Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again.

               Door opens suddenly.

                                     PREYSING
                              (enters)
                         Good morning, gentlemen.

                                     MEN
                         Good morning.

                         Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting 
                         for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal 
                         advisor.

                                     WAITZ
                         Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against 
                         us? -- The whole thing seems to me 
                         to be very simple.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Very simple -- I've always liked the 
                         way you dressed, Preysing -- English, 
                         isn't it?

                                     PREYSING
                              (disturbed)
                         What?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (quickly)
                         They turn out marvelous material in 
                         Manchester.

                                     PREYSING
                         Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they 
                         do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we 
                         begin at the beginning? -- Have we 
                         cigars -- water and everything?

               Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for 
               work is seen in several CLOSEUPS:

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (with a wink to 
                              Gerstenkorn)
                         Manchester is a very interesting 
                         city, don't you think so, Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                              (stalling)
                         Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in 
                         the textile industry naturally has 
                         to know Manchester.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         There's a lot of business to be done 
                         with the Manchester Cotton Company. 
                         They've the whole English market 
                         right in their hands. Have you any 
                         connections with -- Manchester?

                                     PREYSING
                              (quickly)
                         We have a good many connections in 
                         England, naturally.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         I mean with the Manchester people?

                                     PREYSING
                              (looking at Gerstenkorn 
                              impudently)
                         We are here to discuss our merger. 
                         Naturally I can make no statement at 
                         this time. We must begin at the 
                         beginning.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (winking at Schweimann)
                         All right.

                                     PREYSING
                              (far-away commencing 
                              to read his report)
                         Since, on the eleventh of June, this 
                         year -- when the first negotiations 
                         for a merger between our respective 
                         firms was entered into -- both parties 
                         have fully agreed that this merger 
                         can result only in mutual advantages.

               INTERCUT this speech, which if played by Beery will be 
               interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the other 
               three men.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm laying before you the last general 
                         statement of our concern. Active 
                         capital, plant and machinery, raw 
                         material and finished product -- for 
                         instance -- mop rags --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Mop rags --!

               Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on 
               'Mop Rag' report.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         What we want to know about is 
                         Manchester.

                                     WAITZ
                         Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we 
                         want to know.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'd like to wait for Justice 
                         Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --

                                     PREYSING
                         No water -- What a place!

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         All you have to do is phone for it.

               Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes 
               to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is 
               heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- CAMERA 
               HOLDS ON FLAEMMCHEN:

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Water -- seltzer, three or four 
                         bottles and cigars -- good ones.

                                     WAITZ
                         I can see this session is going to 
                         be exhaustive.

                                     PREYSING
                         Now to proceed with the projected 
                         merger, the advantages for the Saxonia 
                         are so obvious...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Oh -- now let's talk like adults. 
                         You want to tell us now a along story 
                         of what your factory can do. We know 
                         all that you could tell us and if 
                         you tell the truth it wouldn't sound 
                         so good. When you first approached 
                         us...

                                     PREYSING
                         We did not approach you.

                                     WAITZ
                              (quickly looking 
                              through the papers)
                         Letter on file September fourteenth 
                         would show that you approached...

                                     PREYSING
                              (snatching the document 
                              from his hand -- 
                              losing his temper)
                         It isn't so -- this was a response 
                         to a tentative feeler of your own.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (snatching the document 
                              violently away)
                         Tentative my foot -- a month before 
                         this your old father-in-law came 
                         very privately and scratched at my 
                         door.

                                     PREYSING
                         Scratched --
                              (he nearly chokes)
                         We did not take the initiative.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Of course you took the initiative.

               Zinnowitz enters the room.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the 
                         conference is already underway.

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- 
                         I'm at cross-purposes with these 
                         gentlemen -- will you clear up the 
                         situation?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         But the situation is perfectly clear, 
                         If you will allow me --
                              (he clears his throat)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         How clear is Manchester?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, 
                         I'm told.
                              (to Preysing)
                         Have you said anything about 
                         Manchester, Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         I can make no statement about 
                         Manchester at this time.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well -- gentlemen.

               There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat, 
               commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Since, on the eleventh of June of 
                         this year -- when the first 
                         negotiations for a merger...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (over Zinnowitz's 
                              voice -- with a sigh -- 
                              sits back)
                         Thank God we're beginning at the 
                         beginning.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (stops suddenly -- 
                              takes glasses from 
                              his nose -- he is 
                              speaking, not reading)
                         As you remember it -- when you 
                         approached us...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (bangs the paper down)
                         We did not approach you.

                                     PREYSING
                         I know you did -- I said you did --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         And I said we didn't.

                                     WAITZ
                         And I know we didn't.

               During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention 
               whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume 
               atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues 
               over her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NO SCENE 61

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is 
               reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn 
               about her. She speaks voluably.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition 
                         was in my blood -- no rest, no 
                         stopping. We were drilled like little 
                         soldiers -- We danced in the school 
                         of the Imperial Ballet, in St. 
                         Petersburg. I was little and slim 
                         but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- 
                         No rest, no stopping. And then -- I 
                         became famous and whoever is famous 
                         is alone... But why should I be 
                         telling you this? Last night I did 
                         not know you at all -- who are you, 
                         really? -- I do not even know your 
                         name.

                                     BARON
                         I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My 
                         mother called me Flix.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Flix. -- And how do you live? What 
                         kind of a person are you?

                                     BARON
                         I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep 
                         of a white flock -- I shall die on 
                         the gallows.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Really?

                                     BARON
                         Really, I haven't a bit of character. 
                         None at all.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No?

                                     BARON
                         When I was a little boy I was taught 
                         to ride and be a gentleman -- at 
                         school, it was a monastery, I learned 
                         to pray and lie -- and ---

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         And?

                                     BARON
                         And then, in the war, to kill and 
                         hide. That's all.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         And what do you do -- now?

                                     BARON
                         I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large 
                         like a happy pig, devouring anything 
                         of life that pleases me, I really 
                         belong in jail

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh! What a picture -- and what else?

                                     BARON
                              (seriously)
                         I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
                              (he turns away)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         That's a silly joke.

                                     BARON
                              (turns -- takes both 
                              her hands)
                         Please look at me. You must believe 
                         me -- you must believe that I love 
                         you -- that I have never known what 
                         love is -- until last night.
                              (he releases her hands 
                              and turns away again.)

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What is the matter?

               He does not answer.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Flix!

               The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them 
               before her.

                                     BARON
                         There.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (with a little cry of 
                              pain)
                         Oh --
                              (in the silence 
                              Grusinskaya puts her 
                              head in her hands 
                              and thinks)

               The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then 
               holds back.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (softly)
                         Did you come here just -- just for 
                         that? Oh -- it's horrible.

               Pause.

               She is suddenly cold.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You may keep the pearls -- I don't 
                         want them any more -- I'll make you 
                         a present of them.

                                     BARON
                              (passionately)
                         I don't want them now.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (broken)
                         I'll not denounce you.

                                     BARON
                         I know.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         So --

                                     BARON
                         Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         But now, you must go... I give you 
                         the pearls. But now you must go ---

                                     BARON
                         I wanted money desperately -- Can 
                         you understand? -- That's why I wanted 
                         the pearls. I was threatened -- I 
                         was desperately in need of a certain 
                         big sum of money. I've been following 
                         you -- I've admired you. But I have 
                         forced myself not to think about you -- 
                         Last night, at last, I managed to 
                         came into your room and -- and now.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (softly)
                         And now?

                                     BARON
                         I couldn't go through with it.
                              (his head goes down 
                              into her lap -- he 
                              sighs:)
                         Remarkable.

               His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.

                                     BARON
                         Do you understand?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- yes -- yes.

               There is a sudden knock at the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Quickly -- here.

               With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the 
               bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the 
               door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Good morning, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (delighted to see her 
                              in a good mood)
                         Good morning, Madam.

               She puts the coffee down on the table.

               Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee 
               down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily 
               crested cigarette case of the Baron.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam has slept well?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Oh, yes, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam will dress now, it is late.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Five minutes, Suzette, come back in 
                         five minutes. I'll ring.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Yes, madam Suzette knows all about 
                         it.

               She is a French woman. She is pleased.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam is beautiful this morning.

               As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes, Suzette.

               Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings 
               open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You must go now.

               As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a 
               dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to 
               the telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         There -- it begins.

               With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and 
               speaks.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...

               During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A 
               charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. 
               His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers 
               the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to Baron)
                         No --

               During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns 
               suddenly --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you 
                         mad? We always have great success in 
                         Vienna... Certainly not. Come here 
                         and see me... yes... good-bye.

               She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.

               The telephone rings again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (quickly)
                         There -- the day begins... I must go 
                         to rehearsal.

               She lets the telephone ring.

                                     BARON
                         Grusinskaya --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes.

                                     BARON
                         You do believe that I really love 
                         you?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd 
                         die after last night.

                                     BARON
                         I want to be good to you -- madly 
                         good.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette will be back here in a minute.

                                     BARON
                         I'll go -- good-bye.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Shall I see you again?

                                     BARON
                         I --

               Telephone bell rings again.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Suzette will be back here any minute.

                                     BARON
                         When are you leaving Berlin?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Very early in the morning.

                                     BARON
                         For Vienna?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you 
                         come too -- I think it would be better -- 
                         for us -- for us both.

                                     BARON
                         Oh -- yes but -- later.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why later?

                                     BARON
                         I have no money now -- I must get 
                         some first -- I must get some.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'll give you what you need -- I 
                         have money.

                                     BARON
                         Oh no -- that would spoil everything. 
                         I'll -- I will manage somehow -- 
                         I'll manage myself. I will go with 
                         you. When does the train leave?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Six twenty-seven in the morning... 
                         But the money?

                                     BARON
                         Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a 
                         whole day. I'll be on that train.

               They move towards the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I shall dance and you'll be with me 
                         and then -- listen -- After that you 
                         will come with me to Lake Como, I 
                         have a villa there. The sun will be 
                         shining. I will take a vacation -- 
                         six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be 
                         happy and lazy. And then you will go 
                         with me to South America -- oh!

               Telephone starts ringing.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         You must go now. Be careful on your 
                         way to your room.

                                     BARON
                         I'll go. -- I love you.
                              (he kisses her)
                         I'll be on that train. I'll get the 
                         money.

               She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Don't do anything foolish -- I'm 
                         alarmed about you.

                                     BARON
                         Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
                              (he kisses her)
                         He leaves.

               Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes 
               deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks 
               at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses 
               them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (speaking into 
                              telephone)
                         Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are 
                         you, in your room? Come, I will see 
                         you now... hurry.

               She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a 
               tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, 
               she is indeed younger.

               Suzette is putting out a dark dress.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Not that dark dress -- something 
                         light -- bright -- it's a sunny 
                         morning, Suzette.

               Suzette happily glances at her.

               There is a knock at the door.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Come in.
                              (sings)

               Pimenov enters, before he can speak --

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Good morning, Pimenov.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (a little puzzled at 
                              change in her)
                         Good morning, Gru -- your --

               Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new 
                         ballet -- it must have mad music -- 
                         I'll explain it to you later. But 
                         now, hurry to the theatre -- I want 
                         full rehearsal -- properties -- full 
                         ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- 
                         Quickly. I will be there --

               During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is 
               busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.

               Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him 
               the cigarette case on the table.

               As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost 
               sweeps Suzette to the door with him.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Gru -- you are positively radiant.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Yes, Pimenov.
                              (quickly to Suzette)
                         One minute, Suzette, I will call 
                         you.

               They leave.

               Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the 
               telephone.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (very very softly - 
                              her voice is like 
                              music to operator)
                         Hello -- will you -- will you get me 
                         Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... 
                         Baron von Gaigern -- yes...

               While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (again into telephone)
                         Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, 
                         please...
                              (she speaks quietly)
                         Cherie... yes... it is you... 
                         nothing... good morning, good morning, 
                         cherie... nothing... no... just to 
                         tell you I'm happy.

                                                           FADE OUT SLOWLY:

               Bring music up.

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#3"

                                      SEQUENCE "#4"

               EXT. HOTEL - SIGN

               Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same 
               angle as before. The sign lights.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK

               The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key 
               shot of the lobby.

               Senf is busy.

               The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. 
               Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is 
               barring the way of an important looking alien.

                                     SENF
                         Step back please.

               Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, 
               happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He 
               does not move but glares at Senf.

                                     SENF
                         I've told you three times -- Baron 
                         von Gaigern is out.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         Did he leave any message for me?

                                     SENF
                         No, he did not -- there is no message.

               This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a 
               whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Senf)
                         Any letters?

                                     SENF
                         No, doctor.

               During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off.

               Kringelein comes to the doctor.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a 
                         day!

               They move away from the scene.

               Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following 
               the chauffeur.

               The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop 
               and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the 
               back of the Baron in the shot.

               CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron 
               in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop 
               waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of 
               orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.

                                     BARON
                              (to Senf)
                         Madam Grusinskaya.

                                     SENF
                              (taking the flowers 
                              and handing them to 
                              clerk)
                         For Madam Grusinskaya.

                                     CLERK
                              (to page boy)
                         Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --

                                     SENF
                              (to Baron)
                         Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.

                                     BARON
                              (Quickly -- shortly)
                         All right.
                              (he glances around 
                              apprehensively)

               Kringelein is speaking to the doctor.

               The Baron approaches them.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Baron, we must have gone a hundred 
                         miles an hour, at least...

                                     BARON
                         Yes, quite.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to doctor)
                         We've been together all day... and 
                         in an aeroplane.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best 
                         shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, 
                         silk -- feels so nice on the skin... 
                         a London hat, see -- made in England, 
                         that's silk, too -- fifty marks... 
                         Look, the price is on it. That was 
                         half my salary before. The Baron is 
                         a very fine gentleman -- no one in 
                         my life has been so nice to me as 
                         the Baron.

               The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.

                                     BARON
                         I'm going to change and we'll meet 
                         for a drink in the Yellow Room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         In the Yellow Room, where the music's 
                         playing and the ladies are?

                                     BARON
                              (amused)
                         Where the music's playing and the 
                         ladies are...

               The Baron leaves.

                                     DOCTOR
                         No pain, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I 
                         had pain I'd be too happy to notice 
                         it...

               NOTE: Find cut here.

               While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM

               The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns 
               up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed 
               under the door, glances at it.

               FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER

               In scrawl: "I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR 
               AT THE GARAGE." "S"

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON

               We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, 
               closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the 
               conference room.

               Bring up noise from the conference room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing 
               all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains 
               of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business 
               battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on 
               his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a 
               pretty picture.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         ...and let me say again for the tenth 
                         time...
                              (he is hoarse and 
                              tired)
                         ...you people were quite ready for 
                         the merger. You declared yourselves... 
                         fully agreed on all the terms -- Why 
                         should the signing of these articles 
                         be suddenly held up?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         I've admitted that at one time we 
                         had reason for desiring ther merger -- 
                         What reason have we now? The Preysing 
                         Company has fallon upon evil days, 
                         very evil days.

               Preysing jumps to his feet.

                                     PREYSING
                         Evil days -- I've shown you here --
                              (he bangs the paper)
                         -- my company exports to the Balkans 
                         alone, sixty-five thousand marks 
                         worth of mop rags a year.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're 
                         interested in something quite 
                         different!

                                     PREYSING
                         What?

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                              (to Gerstenkorn -- 
                              with a sigh)
                         Shall I tell them again?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (glancing at his watch)
                         Why waste time -- it's getting late.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         You see -- what we are interested in --

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (interrupting)
                         Ah, come on -- we're going home.

               Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (rising)
                         Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a 
                         regard for certainties...

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         You've talked enough today, you're 
                         hoarse now.

               IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

               His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram 
               and glances at it. The following scene is played over this 
               closeup.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Sorry, Preysing.
                              (he gets his hat)

                                     PREYSING
                              (nervously)
                         You've decided against the merger?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Yes --

                                     PREYSING
                         Then, it's all over?

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Yes --

                                     WAITZ
                              (to Zinnowitz)
                         Well -- well -- You could call my 
                         office.

               There is a general movement to go.

               FLASH OF TELEGRAM

               Trembling in Preysing's hand. "DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY 
               OFF."

               GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

               Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull 
                         through. This is a very bad time to 
                         be in such a crisis. We've...

                                     PREYSING
                              (interrupting)
                         Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- 
                         it's finished. You've broken off 
                         negotiations. You did it. You're 
                         calling them off. You had nothing on 
                         your mind all day, but Manchester, -- 
                         Manchester -- Manchester.
                              (he develops almost a 
                              passion)
                         You don't suppose for one moment 
                         that I'm such a fool as not to have 
                         something that I could say definitely 
                         about Manchester.
                              (he is generating 
                              almost a passion)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         What?

                                     PREYSING
                         Oh no -- no -- the session is over. 
                         Let's go, it's off. Thank you, 
                         gentlemen.
                              (he starts packing up 
                              his papers.)

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         If you actually have news from 
                         Manchester then...

                                     PREYSING
                         Gentlemen, I am now free to 
                         announce...
                              (he is perspiring, 
                              his hands are 
                              trembling)
                         ...that the deal between my firm and 
                         the Manchester Cotton Company has 
                         been successfully negotiated.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Preysing, you're joking with us.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         You're a deep one.

               QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ 

               GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         In that case give us the articles. 
                         We'll sign at once. We know all the 
                         details...

                                     PREYSING
                              (smiling, slowly folds 
                              up the telegram and 
                              puts it back in his 
                              pocket)
                         I thought we'd suspended negotiations, 
                         gentlemen.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Under these circumstances it's quite 
                         a different matter.

                                     PREYSING
                         Under these circumstances we might 
                         refuse to sign.

               By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon 
               the table.

               Preysing is perspiring.

               Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Come on -- business is business -- 
                         Come on --

               Preysing stands, looking ahead of him.

               Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at 
               Waitz.

               Flaemmchen is awakening.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                         Here's my signature -- here Preysing, 
                         sign here.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What a session this has been.

               While Preysing is signing.

                                     SCHWEIMANN
                         It's twenty-five to six.

                                     WAITZ
                         We should celebrate this with a bottle 
                         of wine.

                                     GERSTENKORN
                              (with his hat and 
                              coat)
                         See you soon, Preysing. Next week 
                         we'll meet and discuss further 
                         details.

                                     PREYSING
                         Next week.

               Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits.

               Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out.

               Preysing has not moved.

               Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry 
               the signature.

                                     PREYSING
                              (to himself)
                         Next week.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         You let me talk till I'm hoarse and 
                         you had Manchester sewed-up all the 
                         time. Why?

               Preysing does not answer.

               Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Well -- the deal has been put through.

               Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes, it has been put through -- it 
                         has been put through.

               During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, 
               glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions 
               to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing 
               is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying 
               not to attract attention.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (to Preysing)
                         What's the matter with you?

                                     PREYSING
                              (hysterically)
                         Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What's bluff?

                                     PREYSING
                              (throwing the telegram 
                              on the table)
                         That.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                              (reading at out loud)
                         'Deal with Manchester definitely 
                         off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have 
                         thought it of you.

                                     PREYSING
                         No one would have thought it of me. 
                         I've been getting rusty in 
                         Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what 
                         the world wants I guess I can put up 
                         as big a bluff as anyone. From now 
                         on...
                              (he turns away)

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         You must go to Manchester at once 
                         yourself and really see it through.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- I must go to England -- I was 
                         desperate -- Now I don't care -- 
                         This sort of thing goes to a man's 
                         head.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What you need is some relaxation.

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd 
                         like to tear loose -- I'd like a 
                         drink. I'd like to go down to that 
                         dancing place. I'd like to start 
                         something.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         I can understand that -- after your -- 
                         uh --

                                     PREYSING
                         Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's 
                         the first time in thirty years that 
                         I've ever... Where's that

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         What do you want with her?

                                     PREYSING
                         I want to see her, I want to do some 
                         dictating -- report of the conference 
                         for my father-in-law.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         She had an engagement in the Yellow 
                         Room at five o'clock -- she was in a 
                         hurry.

                                     PREYSING
                         Zinnowitz, would you say she was 
                         pretty?

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Pretty as a picture.

                                     PREYSING
                         Let's go down and find her -- I need 
                         a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.
                              (he is picking up 
                              papers)
                         I don't know anything about women -- 
                         been married for twenty-six years.

                                     ZINNOWITZ
                         Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does 
                         it. Goodnight.

               Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that 
               moment the telephone rings.

                                     PREYSING
                         Aeh!

               He crosses to the telephone.

                                     PREYSING
                              (into telephone)
                         Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that 
                         you?... The agreement is signed -- I 
                         did it... yes, father-in-law... but 
                         now I must go to Manchester.

               When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking -- 

                                                       DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:

               COCKTAIL SHAKER

               -- which shakes more. Music crashes up --

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO BAR

               Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering. Kringelein is 
               changed. His hair has been cut short and his moustache is 
               gone, he looks almost saucy.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to barman)
                         Barman -- whiskey --
                              (to Kringelein)
                         For you, Mr. Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         For me? -- Oh, please, something 
                         sweet and cold.

                                     BARMAN
                         A Louisiana flip, sir?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A Louisiana flip, that sounds very 
                         nice -- sweet, eh? --

               During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for 
               the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly happy.

                                     DOCTOR
                         What do you do in the Grand Hotel? 
                         Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do 
                         business -- flirt a little -- dance 
                         a little. A hundred doors to one 
                         hall and nobody knows anything about 
                         the person next to him. When you 
                         leave another takes your room and 
                         lies in your bed -- the end.

               At that moment Flaemmchen enters.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         Where's the Baron?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm waiting for him here. The Baron 
                         and I have been together all day. A 
                         hundred miles an hour -- in a motor 
                         car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was 
                         marvelous --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Mr. Kringelein -- How you have 
                         changed, you look so nice.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, 
                         please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, 
                         Miss Flaemm, won't you have something 
                         sweet -- a Louisiana flip.
                              (to barman)
                         A Louisiana flip.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (to barman)
                         No - absinthe.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (amazed)
                         Yes -- that --

               Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried 
               away.

               Flaemmchen laughs.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You like music?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man 
                         might --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (mischievously)
                         A man might what?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I don't know -- I'd like to do 
                         anything --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (very quietly)
                         Oh -- you would!

               The Baron enters quickly.

                                     BARON
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         Hello -- sorry I'm late.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- 
                         A Louisiana flip?

                                     BARON
                         Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you 
                         feel now?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A little strange, Baron.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'd given you up.

                                     BARON
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         Sorry.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?

                                     BARON
                         No thanks -- keeping my head clear.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Dance then?
                              (they exit)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to Doctor)
                         She's beautiful -- isn't she?

                                     DOCTOR
                              (to Kringelein)
                         Oh -- there are plenty of women.

               BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN DANCING

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         What have you been doing all day?

                                     BARON
                         Chasing around.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Chasing what?

                                     BARON
                         Money.

               They dance a few steps, in silence.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You were very different yesterday.

                                     BARON
                         Yesterday -- yes -- that was 
                         yesterday.

               They dance into the crowd.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BAR

                                     DOCTOR
                         Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting 
                         what you're looking for?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         What, Doctor?

                                     DOCTOR
                         A masculine paradise -- drink, the 
                         ladies, dancing...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I had a very good opportunity, a 
                         young lady asked me to dance -- I 
                         ought to be able to dance, it seems 
                         to be very important.

                                     DOCTOR
                         You must learn as quickly as your 
                         time allows -- Believe me Mr. 
                         Kringelein, a man who isn't with a 
                         woman is a dead man.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you 
                         anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you 
                         all alone in the world.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (quietly)
                         I'm always alone -- I have been 
                         everything.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Everything?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I was sent as a military surgeon to 
                         South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken 
                         prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. 
                         I was a surgeon in the Great War 
                         till the end. Grenade in the face. 
                         Carried diphtheria bacilli in the 
                         wound until 1920. Isolated two years.
                              (pause)
                         I've been everything.

               The music has stopped.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That was lovely.

                                     BARON
                         Will you do me a big favor?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I'll do anything for you.

                                     BARON
                         Would you like to make a man happy?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quietly)
                         Yes -- I'd love to.

                                     BARON
                         Then dance the next number with 
                         Kringelein.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Why?

                                     BARON
                         I feel sorry for him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're not a bit like you were 
                         yesterday.

                                     BARON
                         I fell in love last night -- the 
                         real thing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- there's no real thing -- it 
                         doesn't exist.

                                     BARON
                         I thought that, too -- but I found 
                         that it does. Come along, dance with 
                         Kringelein.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Anything for you.

               They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing 
               pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm.

                                     PREYSING
                         Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Hello!

                                     PREYSING
                         I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (with the Baron)
                         Presently, Mr. Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         It's urgent.

                                     BARON
                         Pardon me, the lady has urgent 
                         business here with me.

                                     PREYSING
                              (to himself)
                         Insolent -- Berlin manners.

               At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and 
               crosses to Preysing.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I wish you a very good evening, Mr. 
                         Preysing. You are staying here, too, 
                         Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         I don't know you.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein 
                         at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, 
                         building C, room twenty-three -- 
                         third floor.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (quickly)
                         Come and dance with me, Mr. 
                         Kringelein.

                                     PREYSING
                         I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- 
                         business.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (lightly)
                         Tomorrow morning.

                                     PREYSING
                         No -- now.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Do you gentlemen know each other, 
                         Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- 
                         Baron von Gaigern.

               They bow stiffly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend 
                         and not accept your invitation to 
                         dance.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I could not think of not accepting.

                                     PREYSING
                         You say that you are employed by us 
                         in Fredersdorf, and here you are in 
                         Berlin, indulging in diversions which 
                         ill befit your position and which 
                         are very much beyond your means -- 
                         Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, 
                         I think we will look into your books.

               Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Now, children, no fighting -- save 
                         that for the office. Let's have our 
                         dance.
                              (her arms go around 
                              Kringelein. They 
                              dance off)

                                     PREYSING
                         I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Oh, let the poor devil alone.

                                     PREYSING
                         I did not ask your advice.

               The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a 
               fight.

                                     BARON
                         I think it would be much better if 
                         you went away.

                                     PREYSING
                         We shall see who remains here the 
                         longer.

                                     BARON
                              (shrugging his 
                              shoulders)
                         As you will.

               Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron 
               turns his back to him, watching the dancing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You must look at my face and not at 
                         the floor.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're trembling.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I never danced before -- in public.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You dance splendidly.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Really?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         For the first time in my life, I'm 
                         happy.

               Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.

               Flaemmchen watches him quickly.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Let's stop -- I'm tired.

               It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's 
               distress.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Thank you, Miss Flaemm.

               They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's 
               arm.

                                     PREYSING
                         Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?

                                     PREYSING
                         You may go, Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Does the world belong to you, Mr. 
                         Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         What is this insolence?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do you think you have free license 
                         to be insulting? Believe me you have 
                         not. You think you're superior, but 
                         you're quite an ordinary man.

                                     PREYSING
                         Go away -- go away.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Please -- please!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You don't like to see me enjoying 
                         myself.

                                     PREYSING
                         Who are you? -- An embezzler most 
                         likely.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         An embezzler -- you're going to take 
                         that back, right here in the presence 
                         of this young lady -- who do you 
                         think you're talking to? You think 
                         I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot 
                         dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate 
                         Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're discharged.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Me?

                                     PREYSING
                         Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get 
                         out -- you're discharged.

               Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. 
               Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it.

               Kringelein starts to laugh.

               The Baron steps into the scene.

               The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You can't discharge me -- I'm my own 
                         master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm 
                         going to die -- do you understand? 
                         I'm going to die very soon. Nothing 
                         can happen to me now. Nobody can do 
                         anything any more to me. By the time 
                         you can have discharged me I shall 
                         have been dead already.
                              (his laugh becomes a 
                              convulsive sob)

               The Baron steps between the two looking straight into 
               Preysing's face.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Come, Mr. Kringelein.
                              (he pulls him out of 
                              the scene towards 
                              the bar)

                                     PREYSING
                              (his fists clenched, 
                              between his teeth)
                         The man's insane -- he acts as if he 
                         is glad he is going to die...
                              (hesitates -- to 
                              Flaemmchen)
                         I shall see you in the lobby in half 
                         an hour.

                                    END SEQUENCE "#4"

                                      SEQUENCE "#5"

               FADE IN:

               KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD

               General activity.

               The house detective, later identified, is talking to the 
               chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.

                                     HOUSE DETECTIVE
                         Better let him stay -- I've sent for 
                         the Baron... How's your wife coming 
                         along?

                                     SENF
                         I was at the hospital all night 
                         walking up and down the corridor. 
                         They wouldn't let me in to see her. 
                         She has the pains, but the child 
                         doesn't come and I have to stay here 
                         chained to this desk.

                                     HOUSE DETECTIVE
                         It will be all right.

                                     SENF
                         I hope so.

               At that moment Preysing enters.

                                     PREYSING
                         Did you send that page?

                                     SENF
                         The young lady's there, sir.

               Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking 
               around.

               Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?

                                     PREYSING
                         Sit here.
                              (calls to a boy)
                         Cognac -- for you?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Nothing.

               At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass.

               Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm going to keep an eye on that 
                         Kringelein fellow. I'll find out 
                         where he gets the money to hang around 
                         the Grand Hotel.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well -- you want me?

                                     PREYSING
                              (looks straight at 
                              her)
                         Yes.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well?

                                     PREYSING
                         I must go to England -- at once.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well?

                                     PREYSING
                         You see, I'd like to take a secretary 
                         with me for my correspondence and --
                         humm -- humm -- for company on the 
                         trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- 
                         I don't know if you quite understand 
                         me. You said you have travelled with 
                         gentlemen -- and I mean --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I understand perfectly.

                                     PREYSING
                         What do you think your salary would 
                         be -- for such a trip?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Wait -- I must figure it up.
                              (she smokes and thinks)
                         First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- 
                         it's cold in England in March, I'll 
                         need a suit... You'd want me to look 
                         nice?

                                     PREYSING
                         Of course -- of course.
                              (he is fidgeting)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         A thousand marks --
                              (she waits anxiously 
                              thinking it might be 
                              too much)

                                     PREYSING
                         It's agreed -- I will get a room 
                         here for you.

               She is looking away.

                                     PREYSING
                         I can get a room here in the Grand 
                         Hotel for you.

               She still looks away.

                                     PREYSING
                         Can you pay some attention to me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, yes.

                                     PREYSING
                              (looking off)
                         Insolent young cub!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You mean Baron von Gaigern?

                                     PREYSING
                         Baron!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Well, he's a gentleman!

               THE BARON

               Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein.

               THE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM.

               They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at:

               FLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR

               Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               THE BARON

               He slumps on the arm of the chair.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (watching him)
                         The Baron is tired?

                                     BARON
                         No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --
                              (he shrugs his 
                              shoulders)
                         Well -- well --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could 
                         go to the Casino -- the place we 
                         passed with the marvelous bright 
                         lights?

                                     BARON
                         I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- 
                         I am broke!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --

               The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --

                                                                    CUT IN:

               FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR

               Arguing with Senf.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               BARON

                                     BARON
                         Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.
                              (he strides off)

               Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.

               He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing 
               to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron 
               money. Charming scene.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BARON AND CHAUFFEUR

               Moving into position. They are talking.

                                     BARON
                              (quietly)
                         I've quit.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You can't.

                                     BARON
                         I'm not going to get those pearls 
                         and neither are you.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         What about the money?

                                     BARON
                         I'll pay you back.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         How?

                                     BARON
                         I have an idea working in my head...
                              (he glances at 
                              Kringelein)

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         You might find a bullet through that 
                         head...

                                     BARON
                         If you did that, you'd get nothing 
                         except the police after you. If you 
                         wait -- I'll give you your six 
                         thousand back --

               At that moment a voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam 
                         Grusinskaya's car.

               It is passed along.

                                     INSIDE PORTER
                              (calls through his 
                              little telephone)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car --

                                     MEGAPHONE
                              (outside)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car --

                                     BARON
                              (quickly to chauffeur)
                         Later.
                              (Chauffeur exits with 
                              bad grace.)

               Baron looks off...

               FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE

               Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. 
               Music comes up.

               Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. 
               People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.

               As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly 
               aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (to them)
                         Go on please -- go on, Suzette.

               She and the Baron are alone.

                                     BARON
                              (quietly)
                         Bless you...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- 
                         I shall dance tonight -- How I shall 
                         dance -- I want to feel that you are 
                         in the theatre.

                                     BARON
                         I can't.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         No?

                                     BARON
                         No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- 
                         the pearls. You wear them now...

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Why do you think --

                                     BARON
                         Why?

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         They've brought me such good luck -- 
                         you --

               He takes her hand, kisses it quietly.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I'm worried about you.

                                     BARON
                         Don't.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         On the train?

                                     BARON
                         Yes -- I will be on the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Till then.

                                     BARON
                         Bless you --

               During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As 
               Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the 
               Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his 
               mind miles away.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Was the Baron joking, or is it really 
                         true that the Baron is -- in financial 
                         straits.

                                     BARON
                              (lightly)
                         Absolutely true, Kringelein and I 
                         have to raise some money immediately.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         If the Baron -- if you would permit 
                         me --

               The Baron looks at him suddenly.

                                     BARON
                         What?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I would be awfully glad to oblige, 
                         you've been so decent to me. Three 
                         hundred?

                                     BARON
                         If I could get into a game I might 
                         win some.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Gambling! I'd like that. I have over 
                         six thousand eight hundred marks 
                         with me.

                                     BARON
                         If we could scare up some men to 
                         play.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         We could come to my room.

                                     BARON
                              (with enthusiasm)
                         Good!

               At that moment Flaemmchen passes.

                                     BARON
                         Going?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes --

               Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something 
               that is on her mind.

               A curious little scene.

               She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. 
               The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to 
               Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Ready, Kringelein?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Ready, Baron.

               They move off and are last in the crowd.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                   END OF SEQUENCE "#5"

                                      SEQUENCE "#6"

               No scenes 88-93 inclusive

               Sequence omitted from original script.

                                                             DISSOLVE INTO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are 
               playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., 
               on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The 
               game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the 
               monotonous words of the players.

               White faced, the Baron has the bank.

               Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach 
               the table.

               Kringelein's back is to us.

               They are smart people, not professional gamblers.

               There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around 
               tightly. We do not see the cards.

               The following voices are heard:

                                     BARON'S VOICE
                         All right, gentlemen.

                                     VOICES
                         I play -- I play -- Here -- Up -- 
                         Playing --

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         Yes -- me.

               Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Is that too much, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (glances down at his 
                              own money)
                         No -- not at all.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         All right then.

                                     BARON
                         All right then.

               There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. 
               Kringelein takes cards.

                                     A MAN
                              (quickly)
                         Don't show them.

               Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a 
               new game.

               The Baron deals himself a card.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (to Baron)
                         What do I do now?

               The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to 
               take him to Vienna.

                                     A MAN
                              (next to Kringelein)
                         Turn 'em up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I 
                         win, don't I --
                              (he turns the card up)

               The Baron rises.

                                     BARON
                         There you are gentlemen.

                                     A MAN
                              (to Kringelein)
                         Will you take the bank, sir?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen -- 
                         please, let us drink -- champagne ---
                         champagne is expensive and good. I'm 
                         winning more than I used to earn in 
                         a year -- double what I used to earn.
                              (he is counting his 
                              money)

               They hand him the cards.

               Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Where is the Baron -- where are you, 
                         Baron?

               At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- 
               his face is white -- he has lost.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (rising quickly)
                         Excuse me, gentlemen.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (sitting down in 
                              Kringelein's place)
                         I'll take the bank -- All right, 
                         gentlemen.

               Kringelein has come to the Baron.

                                     BARON
                         That was my last.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You've lost everything?

                                     BARON
                         I've no luck.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
                              (he puts bills in 
                              Baron's hand.)

               Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking 
               plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.

                                     BARON
                         Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my 
                         last chance.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (earnestly)
                         I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, 
                         Baron and to win.
                              (he drinks)
                         It's good, -- come along, Baron.

               They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the 
               bank.

                                     BARON
                         I take five hundred.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         All of that at once, Baron?

               The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't 
               understand.

                                     BARON
                         Eight.
                              (he is triumphant.)

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                              (rings in background)
                         Nine.

               The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and 
               turns to Kringelein:

                                     BARON
                         That's it. The luck's with you.
                              (he walks away.)

                                     VOICES
                         Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm having luck for the first time 
                         in my life.

                                     A MAN
                         Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.

               Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down 
               on the table.

               Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another 
               drink.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Out, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (bitterly)
                         For a while -- I'll recover -- in 
                         ten or twenty years.
                              (he points)
                         Look at that.

               He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's 
               voice:

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         I've won again, Baron -- I've won 
                         again.

               Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron 
               approaches table.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Baron, I drink and win -- I drink 
                         and win -- I win and drink!
                              (he is pulling money 
                              towards him, counting 
                              it, eagerly, 
                              frantically, not the 
                              movement of a miser, 
                              not a greedy movement, 
                              but the movement of 
                              an excited child 
                              liberated. Money has 
                              become so much mad 
                              paper to him.)

               During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has 
               answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back 
               now.

                                     A MAN
                         There are complaints in the hotel 
                         about the noise.

                                     VOICES
                         What time is it? Getting late? Let's 
                         break it up!
                              (to Kringelein)
                         You've been very lucky... Where's my 
                         coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!... 
                         Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the 
                         game, I'm broke and tired; you can't 
                         play against him. I put my hat down 
                         here, somewhere. I think I'll have a 
                         drink before I go. By the way, I've 
                         got to see you tomorrow morning. 
                         How've you been, Doctor?

               Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit.

               Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been 
               like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up 
               suddenly, sees men are leaving --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a 
                         while.
                              (he stands to his 
                              feet)
                         Be my guests!

               By this time the men are pausing by the door.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I oughtn't to presume, but I --
                              (he is a little drunk)
                         I'm so grateful to you -- it's been 
                         so marvelous. The first time in my 
                         life I have gambled -- I've danced! 
                         Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but 
                         it's the first time in my life I've 
                         ever tasted life!

                                     A MAN
                              (slapping him on back)
                         Splendid!

               There is a general feeling in the room that although this 
               man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no 
               wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a 
               nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has 
               reached an emotional pitch.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but 
                         very dangerous. You must have courage 
                         for it, then it's wonderful. You 
                         gentlemen don't know that because 
                         you are all healthy and happy, but I -- 
                         believe me -- a man must know death 
                         and not until then does a man know 
                         anything about life.

                                     A MAN
                              (sings)
                         Rejoice in life while yet the small 
                         lamp burns.

               General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious. 
               Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him 
               goodnight.

               The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's 
               shoulder.

               Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men 
               are nearing the door.

                                     A MAN
                              (starts singing)
                         It's a short life and a gay one...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (seizing a glass of 
                              champagne)
                         Every glass high to life -- the 
                         splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief --
                         brief life -- and the courage to 
                         live it.
                              (turns to Baron)
                         Baron, you know -- I've only lived 
                         since last night -- but that little 
                         while seems longer than all the time 
                         before -- all the --
                              (he collapses suddenly 
                              onto the floor)

               Business ad lib.

               The doctor is there quickly. The Baron next.

                                     MAN
                         Drunk.

                                     ANOTHER MAN
                         Poor fellow.

               General normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three 
               of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry 
               Kringelein to the bed.

                                     VOICES
                              (of players mingling)
                         Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill.
                              (well paused over:)
                         He's a doctor -- The doctor's here -- 
                         He's just drunk!

                                     DOCTOR
                         Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very 
                         ill -- if you will leave.

                                     VOICES
                         Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight! 
                         Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!

                                     DRUNKEN MAN
                         He's not used to champagne -- why 
                         does he drink it?

               Little comedy on exit. Ad lib.

               INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, 
               tragic.

               One man, perhaps, remains.

                                     MAN
                         Can I help, doctor?

                                     DOCTOR
                         No, the Baron will stay.

                                     BARON
                         Certainly.

               Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully 
               making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows 
               behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his 
               hands are limp.

               By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course 
               know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from 
               Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.

               We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see 
               his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his 
               inside pocket --

               He stands looking down at Kringelein.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (drops Kringelein's 
                              hand)
                         It will be over in a minute.

               Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Over -- over so soon -- it has just 
                         begun.
                              (he closes his eyes 
                              suddenly)
                         Oh, the pain.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be 
                         afraid.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (mutteringly)
                         I'd like to live a little longer but -- 
                         I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...

                                     BARON
                              (touching his shoulder 
                              gently)
                         You'll be all right, Kringelein.
                              (he moves from the 
                              bed -- takes out a 
                              cigarette, moves to 
                              the table. He seizes 
                              his drink)

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                              (out of scene)
                         My pocketbook... my money in it...

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         What do you say -- what?

               We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         You what -- Oh, isn't it there?

                                     KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
                         No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost 
                         my pocketbook.

               Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.

               The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.

                                     DOCTOR
                         There is no pocketbook here... On 
                         the floor probably.
                              (He glances down)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (starting up suddenly)
                         More than fourteen thousand marks... 
                         were in that pocketbook.

                                     DOCTOR
                              (looking at Baron)
                         Fourteen thousand marks... One can 
                         travel -- one's happiness might depend 
                         on fourteen thousand marks -- don't 
                         you think so, Baron?

                                     BARON
                              (with a shrug)
                         Quite possibly.

               At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the 
               ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, I've got to find it.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Stay where you are.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No -- I must find it --
                              (he starts talking)
                         Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
                              (he pulls himself to 
                              the side of the bed)

               The doctor goes to restrain him.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         I'm all right, Doctor. There's no 
                         pain now -- only you don't know what 
                         that money means to a man like me.

               He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the 
               floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, 
               his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets 
               under the card table.

               The Doctor looks at the Baron.

               The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (talking at intervals 
                              as he crawls looking 
                              for money)
                         You don't know, because you've never 
                         lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and 
                         saved and scrimped. My life hangs 
                         upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives 
                         you anything. You have to buy 
                         everything and pay cash for it. I 
                         wanted to pay for my last days with 
                         that money. Every hour costs money. 
                         I've nothing -- nothing but that 
                         pocketbook.
                              (he crawls along the 
                              floor on his hands 
                              and knees talking to 
                              the carpet as he 
                              looks)
                         I must have it back.
                              (he pauses breathless -- 
                              like an animal along 
                              the wall -- looking 
                              up at the men)

               The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action 
               in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it 
               is not a long speech:

               The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites 
               his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a 
               thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped 
               him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity 
               for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the 
               time the Doctor watches.

               The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting 
               conscience.

               Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during 
               rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but 
               piercing, says:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He must find his money, Baron.
                              (next time)
                         Mr. Kringelein should find his 
                         pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?

               These are two interjections.

               And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little 
               sack of pain, his head down.

               The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking 
               for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and 
               turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his 
               voice as he says:

                                     BARON
                         Here -- here it is. Here's your 
                         pocketbook, Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (his head coming up)
                         Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found 
                         it -- you found it for me, Baron.

                                     BARON
                              (quickly)
                         Goodnight, Kringelein.
                              (he moves towards the 
                              door.)

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- 
                         don't go -- don't leave me alone, 
                         Baron.

                                     DOCTOR
                         You've nothing to fear, Kringelein

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         No.

                                     BARON
                         Come, get up -- come let me help 
                         you.

               NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- 
               If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.

                                     BARON
                         You're all right now -- it's very 
                         late -- goodnight, Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.

               Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the 
               play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.

                                     DOCTOR'S VOICE
                         Goodnight, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Goodnight.
                              (his hand presses on 
                              Kringelein's shoulder -- 
                              he exits)

                                                              CUT OUT INTO:

               CORRIDOR

               Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of 
               the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In 
               his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience 
               feel his problem with him.

               This man who has lived and whistled and love through the 
               play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron 
               has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his 
               hair back.

               Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. 
               He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of 
               Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The 
               Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. 
               He walks down the corridor.

                                     BARON
                         Flaemmchen, what are you doing here 
                         in the middle of the night.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Looking for my room -- one sixty-
                         six.

                                     BARON
                         You live here?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         For tonight.
                              (she points to door -- 
                              she looks at him a 
                              long time)

                                     BARON
                         Oh!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes -- oh!

                                     BARON
                         Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         And Baron, thanks so much for 
                         everything.

               They both go into their respective rooms.

               Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh 
               Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of 
               funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about 
               themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically 
               for the want of a little money.

               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

               Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp 
               burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining 
               door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts 
               down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his 
               door. She peeps through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM

               from her angle.

               Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and 
               on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's 
               picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake 
               because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his 
               hand.

               FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN

               An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and 
               he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes 
               the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and 
               takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, 
               lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts 
               at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.

               SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR

               The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the 
               adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room 
               the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he 
               is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks 
               hoarsely, quietly.

                                     PREYSING
                         Flaemmchen!
                              (he seizes her to him)

               She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. 
               She is passive -- cold.

                                     PREYSING
                              (breathlessly)
                         You are late. I've been waiting for 
                         you -- waiting.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I had to arrange about the trip.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're sweet.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You think so?

               He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately 
               avoids his kiss.

                                     PREYSING
                              (awkwardly)
                         Come here.
                              (he sits heavily on 
                              the bed, sitting on 
                              her night dress.)

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Here, hold up!

               Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under 
               him.

               He draws her to him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                         Call me -- do you know -- would you -- 
                         would you like to call me by my first 
                         name?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (pulling away, glad 
                              of an excuse for 
                              conversation)
                         Oh, no.

                                     PREYSING
                         Why not?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         I couldn't do that, you're a stranger 
                         to me.

                                     PREYSING
                         You're a funny little creature, 
                         Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         It's not funny at all. One can't get 
                         intimate just off hand. I could go 
                         to England with you and everything 
                         like that -- supposing I met you 
                         next year and I said: 'How do you 
                         do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:
                              (she imitates him)
                         'That was the young lady who was my 
                         secretary in Manchester'.

               Preysing laughs. She laughs.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         That's all quite proper.
                              (she is happy again. 
                              She would rather 
                              talk than be squeezed)
                         But supposing I met you when you 
                         were with your wife and I called 
                         out: "Hello you big baby -- remember 
                         Manchester?' And you with your wife, 
                         how would you like that?

               There is a pause for a moment.

                                     PREYSING
                         Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my 
                         wife out of this.

               Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         All right. I'll get undressed -- get 
                         out.

               He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his 
               fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto 
               the balcony.

               Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the 
               street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a 
               shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. 
               Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves 
               forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French 
               window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively 
               searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar 
               is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. 
               He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face 
               watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, 
               pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.

                                     PREYSING
                         Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want 
                         here?

                                     BARON
                         I must have made a mistake.

                                     PREYSING
                         Made a mistake -- remarkable. We 
                         shall soon see if you made a mistake.
                              (the Baron starts to 
                              leave.)
                              (bellowing)
                         Stay here... Give me that money.

               The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.

                                     PREYSING
                         So that's how we stand, Baron.

                                     BARON
                         Look here, sir -- I'm completely at 
                         your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's 
                         a matter of life or death -- I had 
                         to get some money -- tonight.

                                     PREYSING
                         Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. 
                         Humm -- humm, but you must go to 
                         jail, Baron, you're a thief.

                                     BARON
                         Be quiet.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'm going to call the police. I'm 
                         going to watch you play the great 
                         Baron with the police. Aristocrat! 
                         Aristocrat!
                              (he picks up the 
                              telephone)

               The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, 
               pulls at the knob.

                                     PREYSING
                         The door is locked, Baron.

               The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at 
               his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, 
               (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and 
               one hand holding the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                              (into telephone)
                         Hello! Hello! --

                                     BARON
                         Don't do that.
                              (he tries to snatch 
                              the telephone from 
                              Preysing.)

               Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. 
               The action excites him.

                                     PREYSING
                         Strike me, would you? Attack me would 
                         you? Attack me --

               With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down 
               upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). 
               In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.

                                     PREYSING
                         I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- 
                         I'll strike you -- Strike me!

               By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing 
               come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.

                                     PREYSING
                         I strike you --
                              (with telephone 
                              foolishly in his 
                              hand, he looks down 
                              at what he has done.)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM

               Sharp sound of buzzing.

               Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.

                                     NIGHT GIRL
                         Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --
                              (she listens -- says 
                              to herself)
                         They are having a nice little game 
                         up there with the telephone.

               With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the 
               receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He 
               is terrified.

               Door opens behind him.

               Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, 
               crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing 
               seizes her.

               Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we 
               think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She 
               is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can 
               hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the 
               traffic below.

               Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, 
               it is the first time we have been conscious of it.

               With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. 
               It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own 
               room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from 
               her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears 
               through her own room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR

               Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. 
               After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running 
               across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a 
               Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What 
               the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to 
               scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks 
               around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She 
               will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. 
               Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. 
               The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor 
               had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers 
               and shirt.

               Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes 
               hanging to her, crosses.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (hoarse whisper)
                         Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         where are you?

               She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- what -- what --
                              (he is looking up at 
                              what seems to be a 
                              ghost.)

               She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their 
               faces.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Quick -- something awful -- awful 
                         has happened. Go -- go at once, -- 
                         Mr. Preysing --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Preysing?

               It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must 
               have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a 
               strength.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- 
                         it's awful.

               She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed.

               Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Stay here.

               She waves him away.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.

               Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a 
               crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves.

               WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses 
               outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he 
               knocks.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (calling)
                         Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --

               He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees 
               Flaemmchen's door open next to it. He enters.

                                                           CUT HIM THROUGH:

               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM

               He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly 
               forward.

                                                          CUT INTO REVERSE:

               PREYSING'S ROOM

               Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is 
               open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds 
               has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying -- 
               a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come 
               around as Kringelein enters.

               Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                         He tried to rob me -- he is dead --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         My best friend -- poor, Baron -- 
                         dead -- just like that.

                                     PREYSING
                         -- We must do something...

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (quickly)
                         Yes, the police must be called.

                                     PREYSING
                         No -- no -- wait -- the man was a 
                         burglar -- he was going to steal my 
                         money.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.

                                     PREYSING
                              (suddenly)
                         Where is that girl -- she was working 
                         with him -- she enticed me into her 
                         room.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- 
                         I understand, Mr. General Director 
                         Preysing.

                                     PREYSING
                              (frantically)
                         I can answer for this, it was self-
                         defense -- I can answer for this -- 
                         but that girl -- the scandal -- my 
                         wife -- my daughters, you know them?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, I know them --

                                     PREYSING
                         The scandal -- we are men -- you -- 
                         you could take that affair of the 
                         young lady upon yourself -- take her 
                         and hold your tongue. Then you can 
                         travel -- I'll give you anything -- 
                         anything -- she was with you.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         We must call the police, your 
                         excellency.

               Preysing takes him by the shoulders.

                                     PREYSING
                         How much -- how much do you want -- 
                         you need money -- you have nothing.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Don't worry about me, Mr. General 
                         Director Pryesing -- worry about 
                         yourself.
                              (he picks up receiver)
                         There has been a murder -- this is 
                         room one sixty-four.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TELEPHONE ROOM

               Telephone girl plugs in.

                                     GIRL
                         Hello -- hurry up... hurry up... 
                         someone in one sixty-four says there 
                         has been a murder.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HALL PORTER

               The scene gradually grows intense. Porter calls night man.

                                     PORTER
                         Here - quick - here -- go to one 
                         sixty-four immediately.
                              (calls back on 
                              telephone)
                         Give me Mr. Rohna -- Rohna the 
                         manager.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ROHNA'S ROOM

               Darkened room. Bell ringing. Rohna sits up in bed, turns on 
               light, picks up telephone; on his face we see him hear the 
               news.

                                     ROHNA
                         Where?... murder?... who?... all 
                         right, I'm coming. Wait a minute.
                              (speaks in a monotone)
                         Instruct everyone to use the utmost 
                         tact -- we must have no scandal in 
                         the Grand Hotel. Answer no questions, 
                         I'm coming now -- inform the police.

               (he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly)

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM

               Trunks standing around everywhere. Suzette is finishing 
               packing. Grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a 
               loose night wrap -- she is doing her hair.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam should sleep.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I've done my hair differently -- do 
                         you like that?

                                     SUZETTE
                         When a lady falls in love she does 
                         her hair differently.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                              (rising)
                         In the middle of the night -- those 
                         flowers make me think of a funeral. 
                         Laurels and tube-roses.
                              (she pushes the window 
                              closed, shivers, it 
                              is chilly. She crosses 
                              the room turning out 
                              one of the lights)
                         Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and 
                         the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- 
                         happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.

                                     SUZETTE
                              (quietly)
                         Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. 
                         It is not long 'till the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Goodnight, Suzette.

               Suzette leaves -- turning out a light.

               Alone, Grusinskaya goes to the telephone. She raises the 
               receiver.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Hello -- can you tell me if Baron 
                         von Gaigern is in his room -- ring 
                         him.
                              (talking to herself)
                         Cherie, I must wake you or you'll 
                         miss the train.
                              (into phone)
                         ...yes... are you ringing, he may be 
                         asleep.
                              (to herself)
                         Cherie, you must get up and fetch me 
                         from my room -- I'm longing for you, 
                         Cherie -- I have not been to sleep -- 
                         I kept thinking you would come to 
                         me.
                              (into phone)
                         ...Oh, but he must answer. Ring -- 
                         ring -- ring.

               CUT IN HERE at discretion the:

               BARON'S EMPTY ROOM

               Telephone is ringing.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

                              (to herself)
                         Cherie, hurry -- hurry -- hurry. 
                         Answer the phone -- what is the 
                         matter.
                              (into phone)

                              (to herself)
                         Where are you -- where are you, 
                         Cherie? Why don't you answer?
                              (into phone)
                         Well, ring him -- please -- please.

                                                           FADE OUT SLOWLY:

               FADE IN ON:

               DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR SERVICE ENTRANCE OF HOTEL

               The trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs 
               of dawn, which we remember after the climax of the first 
               sequence.

               Music cold and eerie.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               General early morning bustle and activity.

               From one van, fruit and vegetables are being unloaded. From 
               another, huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and 
               in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time, to 
               another man, from a van backed up --

                                     BAKER
                              (counting)
                         Forty-two -- forty-four -- forty-six -- 
                         forty-eight -- fifty -- fifty-two --

               Waiters coming to work. A noisy racket.

               Sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans, is backed a 
               hearse.

               At the moment we come upon it, the men are pausing in their 
               work to glance. The men take off their caps, as; proceeded 
               by the hotel detective and others, who will be there, the 
               corpse of the Baron in the basket, used at such time, is 
               brought out and placed in the hearse, which drives noisily 
               away. A policeman rides with the driver on the box.

               By this time the man with the bread is counting: 

                                     BAKER
                         One hundred and eight -- one hundred 
                         and ten -- one hundred and twelve...

               Stay with him for a moment.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR FRONT OF HOTEL

               Shooting onto door - day lighting.

               A man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which 
               pulls forward.

                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:

               DISSOLVE INTO - MAIN HOTEL LOBBY

               Early morning. Sense of chill and desolation. Some chairs 
               stand on tables. A vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets. 
               Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand. The 
               various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being 
               cleaned.

               The general feeling of the beginning of another day.

               THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, 
               with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving 
               towards THE CAMERA. He is grim, his hat is drawn over his 
               eyes. His hands deep in his pockets. When he has passed the 
               CAMERA MOVES FORWARD TO:

               SENF'S DESK

               (the old shot) Meierheim is entering quickly goes through 
               the door.

               He crosses now to Pimenov. They talk eagerly out of earshot. 
               But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry.

               Rohna is there too. One of the men carries a telephone stand, 
               wrapped loosely in paper. But we know it's the telephone 
               stand.

               Senf comes on duty, looks around, it is apparent that he is 
               late.

                                     CLERK
                         The night clerk has already gone -- 
                         you are late.

                                     SENF
                         Man -- I was at the clinic the whole 
                         night -- there are no words to 
                         describe what my wife suffered.

                                     CLERK
                         And the child isn't coming?

                                     SENF
                         No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't 
                         let it interfere with my duty. Any 
                         news here?

                                     CLERK
                         News? Yes -- killing in number one-
                         sixty-four.

                                     SENF
                         What? -- Who? -- Whom?

                                     CLERK
                         The big manufacturer killed Baron 
                         von Gaigern.

                                     SENF
                         Good heavens. What for?

                                     CLERK
                         I don't know.

                                     SENF
                         Man -- that's terrible. He was a 
                         nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.

                                     CLERK
                         It seems that he was a thief and an 
                         imposter.

                                     SENF
                         I don't believe it -- he was a real 
                         gentleman. I know people... I'm so 
                         tired I can hardly see out of my 
                         eyes. No sleep for two nights and so 
                         many duties and now this killing in 
                         the hotel -- that means a lot of 
                         work. But it's too bad about the 
                         Baron, you always felt better when 
                         he came along -- always friendly -- 
                         such an agreeable fellow.

                                     CLERK
                         Most imposters are --

               A number of bellboys march up and form a line. Senf comes 
               from behind the desk and inspects them.

                                     SENF
                         Good morning.

                                     BOYS
                              (in chorus)
                         Good morning.

                                     SENF
                         Show your hands.

               They show their hands.

                                     SENF
                              (to one boy)
                         You have dirty nails -- you little 
                         pig -- you're no good... Caps off! -- 
                         Let's see your hair.
                              (Boys take off their 
                              caps)
                         Good -- caps on!
                              (Boys put on their 
                              caps)
                         Where is number seven?... Not here?
                              (to clerk)
                         Take his name -- if he comes late 
                         again today, he's fired. Dismissed!

               The boys sit down on the bench.

               THE CAMERA MOVES TO KRINGELEIN.

               Kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in 
               ear shot.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Please, officer.

                                     OFFICER
                         That will be sufficient for the 
                         present, sir, you may travel in peace.

               Kringelein exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR BY ELEVATOR

               As Kringelein emerges from the elevator, Suzette speaking to 
               the Floor Clerk.

                                     SUZETTE
                         And they've taken him away.

                                     FLOOR CLERK
                         Yes -- it's terrible.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam must not know -- you understand -- 
                         Madam must not know.

                                     FLOOR CLERK
                         I will tell the maids. I cannot answer 
                         for downstairs --

               Suzette hurries down corridor. By this time Kringelein has 
               arrived at his door, he opens it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM

               Kringelein opens the door and enters. Flaemmchen is looking 
               into space. A lovely picture. Morning light over her hair, 
               she is dressed.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         What's the matter?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- 
                         Lying there, his eyes so open.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You loved the Baron, didn't you?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes --

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         So did I. He was friendly to me as 
                         no man ever was.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Perhaps he really was a burglar -- 
                         But they don't kill a man for that.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         He was in desperate straits. He'd 
                         been trying to raise money all day. 
                         He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a 
                         man like Preysing kills him.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (naively)
                         I didn't like Preysing right off.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Then why did you have anything to do 
                         with him?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                              (simply)
                         Money!

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Yes, of course, -- money!

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You don't understand that do you?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Of course I do -- I never knew what 
                         money really meant till I started 
                         spending it. Do you know --
                              (he is silent a moment)
                         I can hardly believe that anything 
                         so beautiful should come to me from 
                         Preysing -- I'll take care of you. 
                         Will -- will you let me?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         What?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         You'll have a good time with me. 
                         Want to? I've got enough money. Ten 
                         thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. 
                         Three thousand four hundred that I 
                         won. It will last a long time. I can 
                         win more -- we'll travel.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there 
                         always.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Wherever you like. Here I'll give 
                         you the money I won, three thousand 
                         four hundred. Later you can have 
                         more.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Later?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It 
                         will not be long -- I'll not last 
                         long. Will you stay with me until...

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, 
                         he'll cure you. They can cure anything 
                         these days.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Do you believe that you will have a 
                         better time with me than you would 
                         with Preysing?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Oh yes, of course.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (takes her hands)
                         Do you like me better?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- 
                         a very good man.

               Kringelein straightens, happy, inspired, a smile on his face. 
               He assumes in his gestures. Takes the telephone.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (into telephone)
                         When is the next train leaving for 
                         Paris? -- Yes... Get two tickets for 
                         me... and my bill please... and the 
                         lady's -- Miss Flaemm's.
                              (puts down telephone)
                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         We have to hurry let's pack -- we'll 
                         have breakfast on the train.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CORRIDOR

               The figure of Grusinskaya is standing at her door, there is 
               no one with her. Suzette steps out.

                                     SUZETTE
                         Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is 
                         waiting downstairs.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
                              (she looks off.)

               FLASH OF PIMENOV

               coming out of the elevator.

               Grusinskaya hurries down to Pimenov -- they meet.

                                     PIMENOV
                              (breathlessly)
                         He will be on the train.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         But when did he go? How do you know?

               She crosses and looks in the Baron's room. A maid is there 
               changing the bedding. The room is unoccupied otherwise.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Baron von Gaigern has left?

               The maid nods.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         When? How long ago?

               Maid shrugs her shoulders.

                                     VOICE OF FLOOR CLERK
                         The Baron left about half an hour 
                         ago, Madam.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Oh -- Gru -- come, come -- we'll 
                         lose the train.

               While they are waiting for the elevator Grusinskaya is like 
               a live electric wire.

               The elevator arrives. They are stepping in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LOBBY

               General activity. We hear the cry go up:

                                     VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car...

               Grusinskaya comes out of the elevator followed by Suzette 
               and Pimenov. Meierheim meets her.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Come along, oh, Madam, come along. 
                         The train will be going.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.

                                     PIMENOV
                         What's the use of asking, Gru -- he 
                         is at the train -- He will be there.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         The troupe, the scenery, everything -- 
                         all on board, waiting. You have a 
                         rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. 
                         Come, Madam, are you mad?

               Grusinskaya crosses to the desk. She speaks to Senf.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Have you seen Baron von Gaigern?

                                     ROHNA
                              (comes over quickly)
                         The Baron is not here, Madam.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         He is gone?

                                     ROHNA
                         Yes, Madam.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                         Four minutes past. Please come.

                                     PIMENOV
                         Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- 
                         he will be there.

                                     MEIERHEIM
                              (calling)
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               Grusinskaya, followed by the others, sweeps out towards the 
               door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXTERIOR HOTEL

               Grusinskaya emerges, followed by the others. The sunlight 
               hits them.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in 
                         Tremezzo --

                         Every seat for the opening has been 
                         sold at Vienna. Sold out for three 
                         days.

                                     GRUSINSKAYA
                         I know -- I know -- but it will be 
                         sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest 
                         then.

                              (knowingly)
                         Yes, Madam.

                                     VOICE
                         Madam Grusinskaya's car.

               Grusinskaya moves forward.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Grand Hotel, Head Porter. What? 
                         There's been -- a child born? A boy! 
                         Yes! My child born! It is healthy... 
                         and my wife? Doing well -- all well!
                              (to Clerk)
                         The child has come. They are both 
                         alive. My child...

               BY ELEVATOR

               At this moment Kringelein and Flaemmchen are coming out of 
               the elevator, Kringelein is carrying his suitcase.

               A bellboy attempts to take his bag but Kringelein, still 
               confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the 
               bellboy.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Let him take it.

                                     BELLBOY
                         Your bag, your Excellency --

               Hearing the word 'Excellency' Kringelein goes through a 
               transformation. He stands and with a flourish hands the 
               suitcase over to the boy. He is a big man now.

                                     KRINGELEIN
                              (very definitely to

                         Cab please!

                              (to Flaemmchen)
                         And now we travel, Flaemmchen... 
                         Glad?

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         Am I!

                              (to Senf)

                                     SENF
                         At once. Any forwarding address, Mr. 
                         Kringelein?

                         Yes, Paris -- Grand Hotel.

                                     FLAEMMCHEN
                         How do you know there is a Grand 
                         Hotel?

                                     KRINGELEIN
                         Oh, there must be one in Paris... 
                         They have everything in Paris.

                                     SENF
                         Your bill, Your Excellency.

               Kringelein pays and taking Flaemmchen's arm starts to move 
               away from the desk, General business ad lib of tipping. Boys 
               line up, making a deep bow. There is almost a triumphant 
               march as Kringelein and Flaemmchen move towards the door.

                                     SENF CLERK BOYS
                              (in chorus)
                         Come again, your Excellency.

               With head erect, happy smile on his face, Kringelein leaves 
               the lobby. Normal activity in lobby, reminding us of opening 
               scene. Doctor comes up to desk.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Was that Mr. Kringelein leaving?

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance, 
		wind into the long club driveway. 
		Martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away.

	LAMINATED CARD

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

	FADE IN:

	ROLL CREDITS OVER:

	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN

	VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of 
	brilliant greens:

	A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD

	pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew-
	soaked lawn.

	FLEET OF DUCKLINGS

	No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes.

	GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER

	At the bottom of a water hazard.

	PALM FRONDS

	After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that 
	surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the 
	air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt 
	Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the 
	palms to

	A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL.

	Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers 
	moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips 
	it out. The trousers walk out after it.

	HANDS

	Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a 
	golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are 
	gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.

	YELLOW TROUSERS

	In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot 
	journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the 
	putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball 
	rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards 
	and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green 
	and into the hole.

	THE GLOVED HAND

	Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather 
	golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the 
	bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing 
	out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. 
	The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot 
	firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the 
	face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half-
	squat. He is MARTIN BLANK.

	We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with 
	him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, 
	another green is barely visible through groves of trees and 
	rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. 
	One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He 
	could be an investment banker, or an arms trader.

	MARTIN'S ARM

	Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second 
	later in the distance, the

	RED SWEATER'S HEAD

	Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His 
	body crumples to the green.

	MARTIN

	Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to 
	the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers 
	absently...

				  MARTIN
		Hooked it. 

	INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER

	The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf 
	club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between 
	a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like 
	peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		I'd come to the realization that 
		everything I'd based my life on was 
		false. And that my life had no 
		meaning.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
			(to Martin)
		He gets this way when he hits over 
		eighty-five.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		It seemed like my life was slipping 
		away, somehow. I was a knot in the 
		middle of a wet rope. Everything was 
		futile and nothing had value.

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		That's the way life is. The only 
		meaning and value is what we create. 
		Through structure, and discipline. 
		Though they seem to limit our freedom, 
		they actually give us great comfort. 
		Your problem is you're looking for 
		some great answer. Some ultimate 
		truth. When what you really should 
		do is go to work and go home.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		And take golf lessons.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		That's a tragedy. Can I finish my 
		story please? I began my search for 
		meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, 
		Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I 
		went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, 
		herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, 
		and a psychic. And they all pretty 
		much say the same stuff.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are 
		telling you the same thing? You're 
		insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Basically the same thing. In a very 
		evolved, esoteric way.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Insane.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		To make a long story short...

				  CLUB MEMBER #3
		--Thank God--

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		...at last I found the holistic system 
		of systems that opened up the doors 
		of heaven for me right here on earth. 
		And everyday I see the world through 
		the eyes of a child. A world of 
		creation and wonder.

				  CLUB MEMBER #2
		Jesus...

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Overflowing with love.

				  MARTIN
		Tell me about it.

	Club Member #1 turns to Martin.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		P.P.P. Personal Pan Power. All the 
		secrets of your universe are divided 
		up into eight easily digestible 
		slices.

	Club Member #1 pulls a laminated card from his wallet and 
	hands it over to Martin. In the distance, sirens begin to 
	wail.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		See, see. It's in the accessible and 
		everyday shape of a pan pizza. Each 
		day you have a little slice of 
		peace...

	INSERT - WALLET-SIZE P.P.P. CARD

	A pizza-shaped diagram showing six "sections".

				  MARTIN
		Oh I see. You got your individual 
		slices of hope, dignity, confidence, 
		self-love, justice, and harmony.

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		You open 'em up and there's the 
		sayings, stories, little bites of 
		insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day 
		Week.

				  MARTIN
		So you eat-- read it everyday?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		And these pan pizzas have opened up 
		the doors to heaven?

				  CLUB MEMBER #1
		Correct.
			(re: the card)
		That's for you. Keep it.

	Sirens are getting louder, closer to the club.

	EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

	The source of the sirens are almost upon us. Martin walks 
	toward his rented Town Car as the VALET pulls it up. He meets 
	the Valet by the trunk, where he trades tip for keys.

				  MARTIN AT CAR
		He fishes out the laminated "Personal 
		Pan Power" card, looks at it, and 
		tosses it onto the ground. Police 
		cars, now visible in the distance, 
		wind into the long club driveway. 
		Martin gets into his car and pulls 
		away.

	LAMINATED CARD

	As it lays on the asphalt. The wheel of a police car rolls 
	to a stop on it.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in a first class seat, the tray table flipped 
	down. On the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines 
	of all kinds - Sports Illustrated, Mademoiselle, Wired, 
	Rolling Stone, National Review, Spin, National Geographic, 
	and on. He draws one off the top, and flips through it, 
	impassively taking in images and reading nothing. When he is 
	done with one, he discards it into the empty seat next to 
	him and draws another-- Martin's way of instantly and 
	massively uploading the world around him:

	Toothless hockey player in triumph, Sony product parade, 
	crouched starving child with vulture in the background, 
	supermodel in suede, Tic Tacs, living former Presidents, arm 
	in arm, smiling, etc.

	INT. HIRED CAR, NEW YORK - DAY

	The livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at Kennedy airport. 
	Martin reclines in the back seat, a conversation having 
	already begun.

				  DRIVER
		How was your day, today, sir?

				  MARTIN
		Effective. But to tell you the truth, 
		I've lost my passion for work.

				  DRIVER
		Do you like the people you work with?

				  MARTIN
		I work alone.

				  DRIVER
		That's it then. That's it. I've always 
		been alone. That's why I'm a good 
		driver. I can handle it. See, I can 
		think on my feet. I survive, I'm a 
		thinker. And I can sit there in front 
		of your house for two hours and it 
		don't bother me. Some people can't 
		do it! Some people are ranting and 
		raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to 
		get out here and get in this car, I 
		can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna 
		go? You're gonna wind up back in 
		your garage at seven o'clock at night. 
		You ain't going nowhere. You leave 
		your house in the morning you get 
		back to your house in the evening. 
		What's the big deal, right?

				  MARTIN
		You understand the psychology of the 
		job.

				  DRIVER
		I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; 
		they can't handle it.

	INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER

	The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the 
	Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror.

				  DRIVER
		You look like you're far away. Far 
		away and thinking about other things. 
		I'm right about that, aren't I?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DRIVER
		Well, let's just say that sometimes 
		I'm right. Sometimes you are.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only 
		natural.

				  DRIVER
			(laughs to himself at 
			this great truth)
		It's only natural....

	The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis

				  DRIVER
		I been looking at you, and I've 
		decided that I want to share something 
		with you.

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

				  DRIVER
		Because your problem is you're bored. 
		And you have a very big mind.
			(beat)
		I am part of what I call a brain 
		syndicate.

	No reaction from Martin.

				  DRIVER
		I am part of a network of minds, a 
		group of five people who are all 
		connected, over hundreds, even 
		thousands of miles, through the mind. 
		We can think with each other, think 
		for each other. I can be driving 
		somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- 
		whatever it is-- and at the same 
		time be thinking a thought in someone 
		else's mind, far away. Running someone 
		else's brain.

				  MARTIN
			(indicates)
		Up on the right.

				  DRIVER
		And when you think of it, it's not 
		so surprising that a small group of 
		people control the whole world, is 
		it?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

	A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper 
	East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows 
	watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across 
	the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts 
	it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves 
	to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, 
	depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for 
	a moment.

				  MARTIN
		If it's not there, I can't proceed. 
		Tell them.

	Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he 
	waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying 
	on the bed.

				  MARTIN
		Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. 
		I'm only in town tonight.

	He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished 
	metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a 
	silencer.

				  MARTIN
		What's different this time than the 
		last time? I have to be down front...

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

	Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the 
	scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests 
	across the arm of a chair.

				  MARTIN
		...I don't bother to call anyone 
		else because you always take care of 
		me.

	He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers 
	a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the 
	scope and sees

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2

	A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, 
	is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing 
	gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across 
	his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is 
	hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING.

				  MARTIN
		Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands 
		full here.

	He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching 
	the messenger.

				  MARTIN
		Good. Account number 3649367, transfer 
		to account number 96-546-38739-47825. 
		Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's 
		Mr. Duckman. If there are any 
		problems, access file 673594638-IO-
		98, and look at it.

	Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the 
	rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the 
	high-rise.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #1

	Of a DOORMAN opening the door for a group of five men in 
	suits. Four BODYGUARDS form a perimeter around the fifth 
	man, a mall, avuncular figure in his forties dressed in 
	Saville Row finery.

	MARTIN

	Takes a step back into the shadows of the room, and raises 
	the rifle toward Window #2.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE - WINDOW #2

	of an empty street. The bicycle messenger flashes past.

	MARTIN

	concentrating, tracks the path of the Messenger, leading him 
	left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall 
	between Window #2 and Window #1.

	STREET

	the bicycle Messenger bears down on the group of men, drawing 
	a Mac-10 submachine gun from his bag. The group see him-- 
	just as Martin's sniper FIRE explodes the Messenger's chest. 
	Two of the Bodyguards collapse onto their boss. The other 
	two open fire on the Messenger as he wipes out horribly into 
	a parked car in front of them.

	MARTIN

	withdraws from the window, and picks up the phone again and 
	begins to break down the rifle.

				  MARTIN
		Sorry Tom. But look, I know it's the 
		playoffs. That's why I'm offering a 
		thousand dollars for one seat...

	Martin listens patiently as he works.

	EXT. STREET - SAME - INTERCUT

	DOORMAN'S HANDS

	unbuttoning his double-breasted long coat.

	MARTIN

	just finishes packing.

				  MARTIN
		...Well let me ask you, Tom. What do 
		I have to do to get courtside tickets 
		for the Knicks...?

	STREET

	The two bodyguards kick at the Messenger's body. The other 
	two begin to move off of their boss, who rises cowering. The 
	Doorman stands behind it all, unbuttoning his coat.

	DOORMAN

	a tall, dark, sharp-featured man in his forties, wearing a 
	handlebar moustache. He moves toward the group of men as he 
	flips open his coat back over two huge chrome .44 Magnum 
	Charthouse Bulldog revolvers and OPENS FIRE on them.

	MARTIN

	is closing his bag when he hears the gun-thunder.

				  MARTIN
		Never mind. I gotta go.

	Martin drops the phone, grabs his scope, and spins to the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE

	of the Doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards. 
	He gets to the man at the bottom-- their boss. The Doorman 
	FIRES both guns.

	MARTIN

	reacts, surprised to see a second shooter. He pulls himself 
	from the window, puts away his scope, and accelerates his 
	exit.

	HIGH-RISE FOYER

	Outside, we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of 
	bodies. He walks back toward us through the glass doors and 
	makes his way through the building toward the service exit. 
	He sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag.

	MARTIN

	his two parcels in hand, exits out the side door of the hotel 
	and walks down the street.

	DOORMAN

	now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, 
	walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY

	Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again 
	on the cellular.

				  MARTIN
		...Tell them that's not my problem. 
		I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- 
		not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.

				  MARCELLA
		Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.

				  MARTIN
		Patch him through....

	Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We 
	recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is 
	GROCER.

				  MARTIN
		What do you want?

				  GROCER
		I'm setting up a concern that would 
		enable those of us in our rarefied 
		profession to consolidate our efforts.

				  MARTIN
		Like a union?

				  GROCER
		Like a club. Work less, make more.

				  MARTIN
		Thank you, no.

				  GROCER
		We could be working together, making 
		big money, killing important people... 
		I'm willing to let you in on the 
		ground floor.

				  MARTIN
		And you could be... sort of like... 
		a father figure to me....

	Grocer ignores this.

				  GROCER
		It's a free-market evolution. You'll 
		wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used 
		to run together when you were a 
		rookie. I don't want to run against 
		you. This thing's real. Everybody's 
		in.

				  MARTIN
		Not me. So don't paw at me with your 
		dirty little guild.

				  GROCER
		I'm gonna get you, kid.

	Martin hangs up and pulls away.

	INT. AIRLINER - DAY

	Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with 
	an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again 
	speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. 
	He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees 
	and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon...

	INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT

	Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily 
	drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On 
	the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin 
	bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes 
	them down with a reddish-orange beverage.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are 
	closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps 
	his chest.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		"Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's 
		been ten years? Where are you now...?

	After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to 
	the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones.

	CLOSE-UP: WIRE

	from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with 
	one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a 
	walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the 
	box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Are you guiding an Outward Bound 
		canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or 
		perhaps in charge of appearances for 
		the NFL like Leslie Gunther....?

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil 
	and twice as long, by a string.

	VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER

	The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY 
	MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread 
	snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. 
	We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. 
	KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers 
	the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole 
	in the floor.

	MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER

	concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the 
	thread. As the drops run down along the thread through the 
	floor, his attention shifts to the

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The drops, huge in the foreground, become smaller as they 
	make their way down the line toward the sleeping man.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Could it be that you're like Chip 
		Longfellow, at the trade-relations 
		tank in Washington. Sandy Glasser 
		owns a cheese shop...!

	MARTIN

	adjusts the thread minutely with one hand, and lowers the 
	fiber-optic cable with the other.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The face begins to fill the screen as the fiber-optic follows 
	the drops toward it. Suddenly, the man snorts and turns his 
	face...

	A DROP FALLS

	It misses the man's mouth and hit's his cheek.

	VIDEO MONITOR

	The man's eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into 
	CAMERA. His image falls away as the fiber-optic is jerked 
	back up through the hole in the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Looking at yearbooks and pictures 
		evokes so many memories...!

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
			(hushed)
		Fuck!

	MARTIN

	stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag, and flies out 
	of frame.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Some good. Some bad. But all 
		interesting...

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	A BODYGUARD sits outside an apartment door. A muffled but 
	dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet, gun 
	in hand. An exit door in the hallway slams open revealing 
	Martin, his gun already pointed at the Bodyguard. The 
	Bodyguard levels his at Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Freeze! Police!

	The Bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double-tapped 
	through the head.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...As a graduate of the class of 
		1984, you are someone special...

	Martin moves to the dead Bodyguard, and locates a retractable 
	key chain on his belt. He unreels the ring of keys and opens 
	the door. He lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags 
	him into the apartment.

	INT. HUSKY MAN'S APARTMENT - SECONDS LATER

	Martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch. He comes to 
	the bedroom and slips across the threshold.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Whenever news of you filters back, 
		the school is excited and proud of 
		your accomplishments...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin crouches down outside the bedroom door. He points the 
	gun at the door, and reaching up turns the knob. As the door 
	opens, the Husky Man FIRES wildly over Martin's head. Martin 
	returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on 
	the floor.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...We hope Grosse Pointe High prepared 
		you well to lead the kind of life 
		that makes an impact on the world...

	Martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man, and raises 
	his barrel to the man's forehead.

				  WOMAN (V.O.)
		...Remember, "there's no where you 
		can go that you haven't learned how 
		to go in time... It's easy..."

				  HUSKY MAN
			(in severe pain)
		Whatever it is that I'm doing that 
		you don't like I'll stop doing it.

				  MARTIN
		It's not me.

	Martin cocks the gun....

	EXT. EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY, LOS ANGELES - DAY

	The perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre-fab office 
	bungalows.

	INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY

	A small suite of dry-walled offices.

	EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY

	is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front 
	of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She 
	is MARCELLA MAYES.

				  MARCELLA
		...So come on back to the old oak 
		tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion 
		committee."

	Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For 
	the first time, Martin looks scared.

				  MARTIN
		Throw that away.

				  MARCELLA
		This?

				  MARTIN
		Don't tease me. You know what I do 
		for a living.

				  MARCELLA
		It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. 
		How was the trip?

				  MARTIN
		Tedious. I now authorize you to throw 
		away all personal mail.

				  MARCELLA
		All of it?

				  MARTIN
		And not show it to me. Ever again.

				  MARCELLA
		That's going to cost.

				  MARTIN
		I'll pay.

	Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella 
	stops him.

				  MARCELLA
		They're not happy, sir.

				  MARTIN
		I'm not happy.

				  MARCELLA
		They say their friend was suppose to 
		have a heart attack and die in his 
		sleep.

				  MARTIN
		He didn't.

				  MARCELLA
		They blame you for the compromise.

				  MARTIN
		And they want me to make up for it.

				  MARCELLA
		In Detroit. This weekend.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them that's impossible. I need 
		my normal lead time.

				  MARCELLA
		They were very upset.

				  MARTIN
		Would you describe their position as 
		inflexible?

				  MARCELLA
		Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

	Marcella looks concerned.

				  MARCELLA
		And sir, I also get that broken-
		mirror, black-cat, Friday-the-
		thirteenth kind of feeling about 
		this one....

				  MARTIN
		There's nothing to be done about it.

				  MARCELLA
		I liquidated the last account in 
		Zurich, and split it into two new 
		ones in Estonia.

				  MARTIN
		Good. What else? Anything interesting?

				  MARCELLA
		Mmm, not really. But you're gonna 
		love this one.

	She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it.

				  MARCELLA
		Enough?

				  MARTIN
		Never enough.

				  MARCELLA
		But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be 
		so easy.

	Martin looks at her wearily. He puts it into the paper 
	shredder at the side of her desk.

				  MARTIN
		I have scruples. Next.

				  MARCELLA
		Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's 
		a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

	She raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk 
	and puts it down again. Martin moves through a door to his 
	private office.

	MARTIN'S OFFICE

	Martin goes into his office and sits at his desk. On the 
	walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships. A bookshelf 
	holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover-- a few shipping 
	manifests, sealane tables, and other specialized reference 
	books on import/export. He sits and stares.

	NEW ANGLE

	Time has passed, and Martin still sits at his desk massaging 
	his gums with a rubber-tipped dental pointer.

	C.U. MARTIN'S TEETH

	The dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like 
	a hummingbird.

				  MARCELLA
			(off-screen)
		You should get going....

	MARTIN

	pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket 
	protector that is also home to a toothbrush, emery board, 
	tweezers, and comb. He stands and walks out of his office.

	FOYER

	Martin moves toward the door. As he passes Marcella she hands 
	him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio.

				  MARCELLA
		Don't forget your identity.

				  MARTIN
		See you next week.

	Martin stops short as he reaches the threshold. He holds up 
	the envelope, and stares a dagger through it. On his way 
	out, over his shoulder...

				  MARTIN
		Tell Dr. Oatman I'm on my way.

	INT. DR. OATMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

	Martin slouches on a leather couch. He holds the mauve 
	envelope, now open.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Why don't you want to go to your 
		high school reunion?

				  MARTIN
		It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do 
		I have in common with those people? 
		Or with anyone?

	DR. OATMAN sits in the window. He is Kris Kringle-esque, and 
	wears a sheepskin vest, rough-hewn shirt, faded Levis, and 
	old Frye boots. Oatman nods with the suave understanding of 
	a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking 
	a tough question.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You went to school with these people.

				  MARTIN
		Come on.

				  DR. OATMAN
		We've spent a lot of time discussing 
		those years. Remember we said that 
		fear is a transfer of the bodily 
		hurt associated by experience with 
		the thing feared, to the thought of 
		the thing. Thus we fear a dog without 
		distinctly imagining its bite.

				  MARTIN
		Shouldn't you be taking notes?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Tell me about your vision of the 
		reunion.

	CLOSE-UP - MARTIN

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - FROM ABOVE

	Of a crowded gymnasium. The alumni below stops what they are 
	doing and look up at Martin, DRAWING GUNS OF ALL SHAPES AND 
	SIZES AND OPEN FIRE ON MARTIN. THE UNITED FORCE INSTANTLY 
	DISINTEGRATES, AND ALL 400 PEOPLE TURN THEIR GUNS ON EACH 
	OTHER. A BLOODBATH ENSUES. ONE ALUMNI SHOOTS HER OWN HEAD 
	OFF, ANOTHER MOWS DOWN THE BAR, ETC.

							   CUT BACK TO:

	MARTIN AND OATMAN

				  MARTIN
		It'll be depressing.

				  DR. OATMAN
		How do you know?

				  MARTIN
		I just know.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Say more.

				  MARTIN
		They'll have husbands and wives and 
		children and houses and dogs.... 
		made themselves a part of something. 
		And they can talk about what they 
		do. What am I going to say?
			(sarcastic)
		"I killed the President of Paraguay 
		with a fork."

	Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You needn't be so frank with me about 
		your work.

				  MARTIN
		Why not. I trust you. You couldn't 
		turn me in because of Doctor-Patient 
		privilege... and I don't want to be 
		"withholding"... and I know where 
		you live.

				  DR. OATMAN
		You know where I live?

				  MARTIN
		We're both professionals, Oatman.

				  DR. OATMAN
		I think what you fear Martin is 
		domesticity. It's the greatest fear 
		that men have who belong to Western 
		Culture. It's centuries old. Like 
		King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th 
		century who decided one day that he 
		was so bored with his dreary life at 
		home with his wife he thought, "Well, 
		wouldn't it be great if we hit the 
		road and fought... oh... the 
		Saracens."  So he put the word out 
		and was amazed when a million men 
		signed up and all of them wanted to 
		go and fight in distant lands and do 
		terrible things to people rather 
		than stay at home with their families.

				  MARTIN
		So you're saying that Ulysses--
		everything he said to his queen when 
		he came back--everything was a lie? 
		He just wanted to fuck around?

				  DR. OATMAN
		Yes.

				  MARTIN
		Mmm.

	Beat.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And how have you been feeling about 
		your... work lately?

				  MARTIN
		Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's 
		just getting hard to go to work in a 
		good mood. I'm starting to think 
		I've been in the business too long. 
		Last week I did a guy younger than 
		me.

	INT. CHURCH -

	SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

	MARTIN

	From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount 
	the altar.  A priest in fact.

	MARTIN'S HANDS

	open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, 
	squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He 
	returns the chalice to the cabinet.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		The church seems to be purging itself 
		of it's pedophile.

	MARTIN

	Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He 
	watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a 
	prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the 
	altar.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		It's a bull market.

	C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET

	The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits 
	the ground.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Anyway, that never use to happen. I 
		was always the prodigy. Now I'm just 
		one of the guys.

				  DR. OATMAN (V.O.)
		Maybe some of the discomfort you're 
		feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over 
		the innocent people you've killed.

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

				  MARTIN
		If I show up at your door, chances 
		are you did something to bring me 
		there. I don't care about that stuff, 
		anyway.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What stuff?

				  MARTIN
			(dismissive)
		Morality.

	Oatman's glad the session's just about over.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Go to your reunion, Martin. See those 
		people and discover what they mean 
		to you. Try not to kill anybody for 
		a few days, see how you feel.

				  MARTIN
		If I get antsy I'll kill a few small 
		animals.

				  OATMAN
		Now we're making progress.

	INT. CONDO - NIGHT

	Very dark. No pictures or plants. Almost no furniture, and 
	what he does have is black. The only sign of life is a CAT. 
	The cat watches on as Martin sorts through a cardboard box, 
	finally coming to a photo album.

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Just a minute.

	INSERT-ALBUM

	A teen-aged Martin Blank: shy boy with a nervous smile. He 
	poses with his mother, an older woman with a kind smile... 
	but her eyes are dark; aged by a life of work and worry. On 
	the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads: 
	"IN LOVING MEMORY... VISTOR ALLEN BLANK...."

	MARTIN

	turns the page.

	INSERT-PHOTO ALBUM

	A photograph of a tall, thin girl: a bright smile from within 
	a bulky winter coat. A girl he's always wondered about: DEBI 
	NEWBERRY. Handwritten on the photo in girlish loops: "Would 
	you rather...?!"

				  CAT
		Meow!

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows 
	him, moaning hungrily--

				  MARTIN
		Food soon...

	Martin opens a restaurant-style refrigerator. It holds various 
	bottles of vitamins, spirulina, wheatgrass, digestible 
	hydrogen peroxide, fluoride treatment, oxygenated mouth rinse, 
	and thirty cans of CATFOOD.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna or liver?

				  CAT
		Meow.

				  MARTIN
		Tuna it is.

	He opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself. While 
	the cat eats, he returns to the cardboard box. Finds a 
	YEARBOOK. Flips it open....

	INSERT-YEARBOOK

	A picture of a senior class "Blues Brothers" party: a group 
	of teens mug to the camera in Blues Brothers get-ups. 
	Sprinters race for a finish line, their chests stretching 
	for the tape.

	DEBI NEWBERY'S SENIOR PICTURE

	A more mature version of the girl in the album. Her name 
	appears under his picture...

	INT. GROCER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Track light fills the gourmet-rustic kitchen. GROCER stands, 
	wearing a burgundy Fila sweat suit, pushing beets into a 
	vegetable juicer. Next to the juicer are piles of celery and 
	carrots, as well. A low-key BLIP is heard from another room. 
	Grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen.

	INT. GROCER'S GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Grocer enters the main room of the villa-style A-frame. He 
	moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a COMPUTER.

	ON-SCREEN GRAPHICS

		  "Click OK for remote access caller"

	OK is clicked.

		   "Availability for two days in Detroit area"

				 "Terms"

				"$560,000"

				  "When"

				  "Now"

				"OK/ FAX materials"

	Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a 
	moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer 
	beeps.

	  "confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471"

	Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A 
	graphic appears:

		"Connection is terminated/ Status idle"

	Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his 
	juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast.

	INT. PLANE - NIGHT

	Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest 
	on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and 
	they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside 
	a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, 
	he sets the book down and takes up Iron John.

	INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING

	At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, 
	two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in 
	blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing 
	crowd.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always say 
		that. I'm telling you, you never met 
		the man.

				  MCCULLERS
		Seventeen months ago I was posting a 
		walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He 
		never saw me. But I saw him, though.

				  LARDNER
		Lisbon?

				  MCCULLERS
		In Portugal, yes.

	In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down 
	the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, 
	drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.

				  LARDNER
		Here's the news: He hasn't been in 
		Portugal since '90. I know that from 
		the file. Why don't you read the 
		file, man?

				  MCCULLERS
		In fact, I think I talked with him, 
		in Bonn.

	Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.

				  LARDNER
		You always say that. You always have 
		to know everybody. Why don't I just 
		take the weekend off and let you 
		kill him. Since you two are so close.

	They exit.

	EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

	INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport 
	artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...with highs today in the upper 
		seventies. Related stocks on Wall 
		Street today as scandal continues to 
		rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech 
		Center...

	MARTIN'S CAR

	blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid-
	eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied 
	by two figures.

	INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE

	are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast.

				  BROADCAST (V.O.)
		...An unknown "whistle-blower" has 
		leaked a number of critical flaws in 
		the safety designs of next year's 
		models to authorities that could 
		cost millions in recalls....

	MARTIN

	flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes 
	fascistically.

				  MARTIN
		Mein hero.

	...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon 
	Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash.

	EXT. HIGHWAY-

	Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. 
	Dig it...

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR

	Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar 
	voice....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
			(on radio)
		--this is WFRN, all vinyl, all the 
		time. Oldies from the eighties. It's 
		a cold summer day in Grosse Pointe--

								   CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP - A FULL, FEMALE MOUTH

	lit only by dime slivers of sunlight, in front of a 
	microphone. Stray, gossamer strands of hair hanging in her 
	face move in front of her mouth as she speaks....

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--and I'm ready for some good tunes 
		and angry talk. Or angry tunes and 
		good talk--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	looking somewhere far away, beyond what is before him in the 
	windshield...

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--Or maybe we'll just play the Cocteau 
		Twins and get over the goo-angry-
		talking music. As you know--

								   CUT TO:

	THE DEEJAY'S HANDS

	as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the 
	mic.

				  FEMALE DEEJAY (V.O.)
		--for some moments in life there are 
		no words, and a little nonsense now 
		and then is relished by the wisest 
		man--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	still rapt, makes a sharp turn into a shopping district.

								   CUT TO:

	HER MOUTH

				  FEMALE DEEJAY
		--The Cocteau Twins, though also a 
		band of the nineties, will be aired 
		due to the fact that they created 
		their own language to sing by--

								   CUT TO:

	MARTIN

	slows on a quaint street of cute shops. He creeps up to a 
	storefront on hid right and stops, staring through the 
	passenger window....

								   CUT TO:

	DEBI NEWBERRY

	the female deejay. She sits slumped in a well-worn executive 
	chair, her back to the studio console and the picture window 
	behind it that opens to the street....

				  DEBI
		--Now that's freedom--

	she swivels in the chair to face the street....

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's Town Car outside, Martin silhouetted in shadow.

	DEBI

	Her brow furrowed as she peers at the car, something summoned 
	by the dark figure. Her words falter almost imperceptibly.

				  DEBI
		--The best I can do is a rhyme: Where 
		are all the good men dead? In the 
		heart or in the head? Back later....

	MARTIN

	Shaken from his trance by her stare, pulls back into the 
	street and disappears....

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MORNING

	Martin drives, listening to the radio. He turns the corner 
	with an expectant look on his face. Suddenly his face drops 
	as he slows and pulls over....

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - 7-11 STORE

	Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then 
	back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car.

	WIDE SHOT

	of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle 
	of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves 
	in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the 
	clerk inside.

				  MARTIN
		What are you doing here?

	CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question.

				  CARL
		A double shift. What's it look like?
			(softening)
		Can I help you with something?

	Martin's head pans the room, processing.

				  MARTIN
		I don't think so.

	EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING

	Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar 
	landscape.

				  MARTIN
			(into phone)
		Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick 
		up if you're there... It's Martin 
		Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not 
		here. My house is gone and now there's 
		a 7-11 here... And that's 
		unfortunate... You can never go home 
		again, Dr. Oatman.

	Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		But I guess you can shop there.

	INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She 
	banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late 
	fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching 
	her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, 
	a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from 
	Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating.

				  NURSE
		Mary, your son's here.

	The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and 
	pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They 
	start out of the room.

	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

	They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, 
	baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes 
	and hacks.

				  MARY
		I bought a new rug.

				  MARTIN
		That's wonderful, Mom.

				  MARY
		What's a revival tent?

				  MARTIN
		It's a place where religious people--

				  MARY
			(knowingly)
		Marlin Perkins and Jim!

				  MARTIN
		Jim?

				  MARY
		His assistant. He acted like Marlin's 
		son, only he wasn't. At least they 
		never said he was... I bet they were 
		lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. 
		Wild Kingdom my ass!

	Mary coughs horribly.

				  MARTIN
		It's good to see you. I'm sure you're 
		curious about what I've been doing.

				  MARY
		I spoke to your father the other 
		day.

				  MARTIN
		I imagine that'd be rather difficult.

				  MARY
		Nature made him then broke the mold.

	Martin decides to change the subject.

				  MARTIN
		They told me you're taking lithium, 
		mom.

				  MARY
		Yes, they give me headaches. I have 
		a headache.

				  MARTIN
		You have a headache?

				  MARY
		I have a headache. You have a 
		headache?

				  MARTIN
		No, I don't have one.

				  MARY
		You don't have a headache. I have a 
		headache.

	Mary leans in close, smiling.

				  MARY
		We had a good laugh, didn't we?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah. I guess we did.

	EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY

	As they head toward Martin's car, Mary stops and points to 
	it.

				  MARY
		Why don't you return this car and 
		borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to 
		the rent-a-car so you can get a ride 
		back.

				  MARTIN
		I think I'll go see Debi today.

				  MARY
		Of course you will.

				  MARTIN
		I can't think of anything to say to 
		her that seems appropriate given I 
		left and never said goodbye to her.

				  MARY
		Take care of her. She's a keeper.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  MARY
		And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro 
		on foreign exchange?

				  MARTIN
		I have always thought about her and 
		missed her.

	A nurse approaches with a wheelchair.

				  MARY
		Separate the wheat from the chaff 
		and you've got the candle cat.

	Together, Martin and the nurse help Mary into it. Mary gazes 
	at Martin, taking him in.

				  MARY
		Remember no matter how impossible 
		your problems feel. I've known people 
		without a chance in the world. And 
		all of a sudden, they have lives.  
		Time allows miracles. Let yourself 
		breathe, son.

	Martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek. The nurse 
	spins the chair around and heads toward the building. He is 
	somewhat fatigued from the experience, but he tries once 
	more to connect.

				  MARTIN
		Mom...

	The nurse stops and turns Mary around to face him. Mary looks 
	up at Martin and brightens. She starts to sing out like Ethel 
	Merman, arms out Broadway style.

				  MARY
		"What's up doc/ what's cookin'?/ 
		What's up doc?/ Are ya lookin'?/ 
		Hey! Look out!  You're gonna hurt 
		someone,/ with that old shotgun,/ 
		Hey... what's... up... Doooooc...!/ 
		We really mean it!"

	Mary stops short, and squints at Martin.

				  MARY
		Hey, you're a handsome devil. What's 
		your name?

	EXT. GRAVEYARD ROAD - DAY

	Martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of 
	headstones. He jerks his hand in a stiff wave...

				  MARTIN
		Hey Pop... You got off easy. The 
		house is a 7-11. Mom's a psycho-
		pharmacological punching bag and I 
		murder for cash. If you were here I 
		think you'd be proud.

	He drives off.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAY

	The room features a big square bed, dresser and television. 
	Martin enters, kicks a leather bag under the bed, and grabs 
	the steel-sided briefcase.

				  MARTIN
		pries out a wall vent, slides in the 
		case and replaces the vent.

	EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers are staked out along the main strip of 
	town. Lardner snores, face pressed up against the passenger 
	window. McCullers lays back in his seat, a to-go cup in his 
	lap. He taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings 
	his favorite Bob Seeger song to himself...

				  MCCULLERS
		"...Against the wind... just a young 
		man running... Against the wind... 
		let the cowboy's ride!... Blame on 
		it the thuuunder! Night moves..."

	McCullers catches of Martin's Town Car coming down the street. 
	He nudges Lardner, and points.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V.

	of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the 
	radio station. He gets out, looking nervous.

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into 
	the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare 
	at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment...

				  DEBI
			(on air, groping)
		WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. 
		Oldies from the eighties. That was 
		ah... the Specials. Doing... one of 
		their songs...

	Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back 
	to turntable A and lets the record roll on.

				  DEBI
		...and here's another.

	Debi swivels around to face Martin.

				  MARTIN
		"Oldies from the eighties?"

	After a long pause....

				  DEBI
		I just play my own collection.

				  MARTIN
		It's nice to see you again.

	Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock.

				  MARTIN
		How long has it been?

				  DEBI
		Since you stood me up on prom night 
		and vanished without saying a word?

				  MARTIN
		Ten years, I think. What I miss?

	Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense.

				  DEBI
		Well, let me see... they tore down 
		the George Orwell monument and put 
		up a bust of George Michael. Main 
		Street's a four-laner, no left turns 
		four to seven. I was married and 
		divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now 
		officially the new sister city to 
		Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have 
		fiber-optic town meetings every two 
		months.

				  MARTIN
		Here is now there. There is here.

	Their eyes lock on each other...

				  DEBI
		Those are the headlines.

	The request line buzzes.

				  DEBI
		Hold that thought.
			(into phone)
		WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, 
		all the...
			(pauses)
		No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years.

	Beat. Debi makes the move.

				  DEBI
		Tell me about yourself.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in California most of the time. 
		Traveling a lot on business. That's 
		about it, really.

				  DEBI
		That's it?

				  MARTIN
		Not much else.

				  DEBI
		What's your business?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  DEBI
		Professional killer. Do you get dental 
		with that?

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I'm in town for a few days, 
		anyway.

	They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. 
	Martin gets the fear, breaks it off.

				  MARTIN
		Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.

				  DEBI
		Okay.

	Martin leaves Debi sitting alone, in disbelief.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin steps out of the storefront station along the 
	fashionable Grosse Pointe shopping district. He stops in the 
	middle of the street with a strained look on his face.

	INT. LARDNER & MCCULLERS' COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	LARDNER & MCCULLERS' P.O.V.

	of Martin standing in the street.

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	They frown, wondering at Martin's next move.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi lost in thought, still. After a moment, she sits upright 
	and flips the "ON-AIR" switch.

				  DEBI
			(into mike)
		A man comes to you. He is from the 
		past bringing you pain long since 
		put behind you. He says peculiar 
		things and leaves abruptly. It all 
		comes flooding back...

	EXT. STREET -

	Martin stops in his tracks. His face softens, then becomes 
	determined. He turns and walks back toward the station.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH -

	Debi broadcasting...

				  DEBI
		It felt like an apparition, or some 
		cheap, gruesome Rod Serling time 
		warp I'd been thrust back into without 
		warning. There's a strangeness in 
		the air and I don't mind telling 
		you, I'm a little spooked. He was a 
		man from my past. A man I loved. A 
		man who disappeared.

	DEBI'S P.O.V.

	of Martin walking back into the station.

				  DEBI
		A man who's walking back into the 
		station.

	Martin comes into the booth. The temperature rises as they 
	square off.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE -

				  LARDNER
		Well?

				  MCCULLERS
		I don't think so.

				  LARDNER
		Well, remember when Frysal's men 
		paid off the Deejay in Cairo to 
		announce a bogus press conference in 
		the --

				  MCCULLERS
		--Nooo--

				  LARDNER
		--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in 
		'72. A local radio station started 
		broadcasting news of the massacre 
		two minutes before it happened.

	McCullers is not to be outdone.

				  MCCULLERS
		That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.

				  LARDNER
		It was the PLO.

				  MCCULLERS
		Whatever.

	INT. DEEJAY BOOTH

	Martin and Debi locked in a passionate embrace. They break 
	away.

				  DEBI
		Sit.

	Martin obeys. Debi clandestinely flips the "ON-AIR" switch 
	as she drops into her chair. The "ON-AIR" light bar goes on 
	above and behind Martin. Unbeknownst to him their conversation 
	is put out over the airwaves.

				  DEBI
		All right mystery man. I want some 
		answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. 
		Two young lovers with frightening 
		natural chemistry. The girl sits in 
		a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at 
		her father's house waiting for the 
		most romantic night of her young 
		life. The boy never shows up, until 
		now. So, what's the question?

				  MARTIN
		Where have I been?

				  DEBI
		More like what happened? What 
		happened, Mr. Blank?

				  MARTIN
		I don't know exactly. I could venture 
		a guess but it would sound like a 
		rationalization... I thought you 
		know... maybe seeing you, some 
		friends, my house... of course now a 
		7-11--

				  DEBI
		--Torn down in the name of convenience--

				  MARTIN
		--and I guess, sure, seeing you would 
		be part of that whole equation... I 
		suppose the most important thing, 
		really. I don't know. Anyway, this 
		whole thing's my therapist's idea. 
		It's my shrink, really.

				  DEBI
		Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?

				  MARTIN
		You see someone?

				  DEBI
		Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade 
		later, and you want to sort things 
		out with me. The question now is, do 
		I allow you... access... to my being?

	Martin says nothing.

				  DEBI
		All right then. Would you like to 
		share any more deeply personal 
		thoughts with our listening audience 
		before we go to our phone poll and 
		see how the folks in radioland come 
		down on this one?

	A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to 
	bolt.

				  DEBI
		Should a broken-hearted girl give a 
		guy a second chance at love....

	Debi jabs a phone line on the console.

				  DEBI
			(HARD)
		You're on the air.

	Martin deflates.

				  OLD WOMAN'S VOICE
		I think this young man has avoided 
		the question completely. Has not 
		discussed "what happened" nor if 
		he's sorry for what he has done. 
		Therefore, I don't see any reason 
		why you should see him until he fully 
		discloses his intentions and feelings.

				  DEBI
		Thank you caller.

	Stabs another line.

				  DEBI
		You're on the air.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Are you there?

				  DEBI
		Yes.

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		No, the guy.

	Martin looks up, humiliated.

				  MARTIN
		Yeah....

				  DUMB GUY VOICE
		Uh... when you guys use to go out... 
		Did you guys ever... heh heh heh 
		heh... ever fuckin', ever totally 
		fuckin' heh heh heh-

				  DEBI
		Next caller.

				  GUFF MAN VOICE
		I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad 
		gas to me. I would not allow him 
		access to your being.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  DEBI
		Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you 
		loud and clear: "If you love something 
		set it free. If it comes back to you 
		it's, well...

	She turns to him and shrugs apologetically.

				  DEBI
		...Broken...."

	Martin has his answer.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down.

				  MARTIN
		Dammit. Never trust my instincts.

	He scans the main strip.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, 
	forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats 
	and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. 
	Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he 
	remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him.

	FELIX'S P.O.V.

	As he walks down the street, he spots the Country Squire, 
	and eyes Lardner and McCullers in the front seat.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	follows Felix's eyes to Lardner and McCullers and catches 
	their look. Their eyes lock, neither wanting to betray that 
	they've made each other. They all do a pretty good job. His 
	P.O.V. swings to a square-jawed, hale fellow wearing dark 
	sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet 
	away. The man is going for something in his breast pocket...

	Reaches into his own jacket, most likely for a gun....

	THE MAN

	pulls out a glasses case, and takes off his shades-- He is 
	PAUL SWIDERSKI.

	MARTIN AND PAUL

	Martin relaxes.

				  PAUL
			(grinning ear-to-ear)
		Hell, I would've voted for you, but 
		there's all this apple sauce stuck 
		in my phone... I don't wanna talk 
		about it. How the hell are you?!
			(extends his hand)
		Here's five good ones!

	No trace of recognition on Martin's face.

				  PAUL
		Marty! It's me. Paul.

				  MARTIN
			(realizing)
		Paul?

				  PAUL
			(re: hand)
		You're leaving me hanging here...

	They shake. Martin looks him up and down, astonished at the 
	respectable veneer of his old burn-out friend.

				  PAUL
		Hey. Give me a break.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - DAY

	Martin and Paul rive through Grosse Pointe, Michigan: Wide 
	streets lined with huge, shady oaks. Castle-like homes on 
	golf-course green lawns. A comfortable, Midwestern Beverly 
	Hills. They are cruising their old haunts, Paul smoking a 
	joint.

				  PAUL
		This won't take but a minute. I just 
		gotta hold their hands for a final 
		walk-through. I'll take them in, get 
		'em out, then you and I can grab a 
		little quality time.

	Martin looks out the window, breathing in the past.

				  PAUL
		Goddamn, It's good to see you. I was 
		afraid you joined a cult or something. 
		I half-expected you to come back to 
		town in a fennel wreath and paper 
		pants.

	Paul offers Martin the joint. He declines.

				  MARTIN
		There was no money in it.

	Martin regards Paul archly.

				  MARTIN
			(grinning)
		So what happened to you?

				  PAUL
		Same thing that happened to you-- I 
		stopped poutin' there on the 
		sidelines. Got in. Got on the team.  
		I joined the working week, you slick 
		fucking asshole, so why don't you 
		valet park your high horse and take 
		it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

				  MARTIN
		Fair enough.

	Beat.

				  PAUL
		God it's great to see you.

				  MARTIN
		You too.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of a lovely YOUNG COUPLE on the front porch of a mid-sized 
	Wright home... Perhaps that could be him if things were 
	different, but for now it feels like along shot. Paul is 
	hawking the house to them out of earshot.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD (V.O.)
		Well, we do what we have to do if we 
		find you on the property. But we 
		don't really enforce the law, we 
		execute company policy for homeowners.

	MARTIN AND THE GUARD

	standing in the driveway.

				  MARTIN
		So when are you authorized to use 
		deadly force?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, a 'course, taxes provide your 
		basic service-- police and whatnot. 
		But our customers need a little more 
		than just that, you understand? This 
		badge doesn't mean that I am a peace 
		officer.

	The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back.

				  MARTIN
		So it's not a meaningful symbol, or 
		anything. That badge is just the 
		badge of your company. If I look 
		suspicious on your customers' property--
		well, under those heightened 
		circumstances you have the authority 
		to, ah... To shoot me.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		To shoot you. Correct.

				  MARTIN
		How did you get this job?

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		Well, they were hiring, and it was 
		only a two week course...

				  MARTIN
			(pleasantly)
		Wow.

	Paul walks the happy couple down the steps.

				  PAUL
			(to couple)
		...What more can I say.

				  HUSBAND
			(smiling)
		We'll talk soon.

				  PAUL
			(much hand gesturing)
		You'll be raising your new family in 
		a work of art. A work of art in a 
		work of art.

	Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the 
	sell.

				  SOUTHTEC GUARD
		I'm sure you'll be very happy.

	All look to Martin....

				  MARTIN
			(heartfelt)
		When my time comes, if it ever does, 
		I want a beautiful, normal place 
		like this... and a wife like you...

	All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard.

				  MARTIN
		...and you'll be safe here...

	Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE

	Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house 
	in the distance.

	INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER

	Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming 
	neighborhood.

				  PAUL
		Now. I don't make a habit of pimping 
		my friends, but there is one prime 
		little piece of land that you must 
		see...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and 
	winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the 
	house.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi's house.

				  PAUL (V.O.)
		Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?

	C.U. OF MARTIN

				  MARTIN
		No. You drove us here.

				  PAUL
		Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, 
		isn't it?

				  MARTIN
		No.

	Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the 
	window.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	of the mansion.

	They roll slowly by Debi's house.

	They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to 
	the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin.

				  PAUL
		Ten years. What happened!?

				  MARTIN
		I freaked out, joined the Army, worked 
		for the government, and went into 
		business for myself... I'm a 
		professional killer.

				  PAUL
		Thank you.

	Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road.

				  PAUL
		Professional killer, huh? Does that 
		come with a good HMO?

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The 
	sign above it says

		  "DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS"

				  MARTIN
			(looking ahead)
		He sells BMW's?

				  PAUL
		He sold me this bad boy.

				  MARTIN
		How could you put your hard-earned 
		dollars into the hands of the class 
		bully?

				  PAUL
		He gave me a great deal.

				  MARTIN
		Mein Dealer.

	Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry-
	looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing 
	up amidst his stable of expensive cars.

				  PAUL
		Hey! Bob! The car's running great.

				  BOB
			(dismissive)
		Glad to hear it.

	Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away.

				  MARTIN
			(shouts)
		Bob...

				  BOB
			(turning)
		What?

				  MARTIN
		It's me. Martin Blank.

				  BOB
		Really...? So what?

				  MARTIN
		Okay. See you later.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward 
	his own. Paul calls after him.

				  PAUL
		See you at the left-a-boy-came-back-
		a-man-made-good party.

	Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away.

	MARTIN

	stands across the street from the radio station, looking at 
	Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from 
	his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE

	of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the 
	beat of an unheard song.

	MARTIN

	dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car.

	INT. 7-11 - NIGHT

	Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at 
	his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban 
	teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video 
	game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still 
	working the double, nods to Martin.

				  CARL
		Can I help you?

				  MARTIN
		What's done is done.

	Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a 
	pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the 
	counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into 
	a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and 
	bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

	FELIX

	Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand.

	MARTIN

	grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom 
	of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit.

	CARL

	grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his 
	hands up.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Plays on.

	FELIX AND CARL

	Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward

	MARTIN

	Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking 
	out each freezer door behind him.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped 
	store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the 
	counter, sending Martin diving out of view.

	MARTIN

	pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now 
	two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on 
	Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, 
	spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can 
	take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's 
	left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires.

	Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground.

	THE SKATEBOARDER

	Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious 
	to the surrounding carnage.

	CASHIER ISLAND

	Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves 
	to Carl.

	CARL

	is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and 
	finds

	A BOMB

	under the corpse.

	MARTIN

	Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the 
	counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the 
	Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed--

				  SKATEBOARDER
		What the fuck, man?!

	The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. 
	The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of 
	the double doors.

	EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS

	The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is 
	peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell.

	INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive 
	and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb 
	and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style.

	EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT

	Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi 
	looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking 
	Heads plays in the studio.

				  MARTIN
		Are you going to the reunion?

				  DEBI
		No. I'm not going. Is that why you're 
		here?

				  MARTIN
		That's part of it.

				  DEBI
		Well, you'll have a ball. You seem 
		to have everything everybody wants 
		when they go back. The car, the suit, 
		the watch. The look. That just leaves 
		the little things, like happiness, 
		character, point of view...

				  MARTIN
		It's always the little things.

				  DEBI
		Yep.

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		I'm wondering how you've been. How 
		you are. I'd like to catch up with 
		you. If it's possible.

	Beat as Debi considers. She spins her seat to face him.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.

				  MARTIN
		Well, there's not much to tell.

				  DEBI
		I'm sure you've done worthwhile things 
		in the last ten years. You've had 
		experiences.

				  MARTIN
		Bad experiences.

				  DEBI
		You met people.

				  MARTIN
		Bad people.

				  DEBI
		Watched television?

				  MARTIN
		Bad television.

				  DEBI
			(amused)
		Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It 
		sounds like you need a Shockabuku.

				  MARTIN
		What's that?

				  DEBI
		It's a swift spiritual kick to the 
		head that alters your reality forever.

				  MARTIN
		That'd be good.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		What do you want?

	The question is open.

				  MARTIN
		I figured I could pick you up tomorrow 
		around seven o'clock.

				  DEBI
		Let me get this straight, are you 
		asking me out?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Unbelievable.

				  MARTIN
		Seven it is.

				  DEBI
		I'll think about it.

	EXT. JOSHUA TREE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

	Under a crisp and starry night, a man and a woman sit around 
	a campfire. As we MOVE CLOSER we see that the woman is 
	Marcella reading, "Women Who Run With Wolves."  She tends to 
	s'mores on the campfire, assembles one, and hands it to MONTY, 
	her young outdoorsman boyfriend. Monty is perched on a small 
	boulder, engaged in a Tai-Chi-like ritual, wearing Patagonia's 
	finest. There is a path of crystals leading from the fire to 
	the boulder. In the background is a tent and a Nissan 
	Pathfinder. Monty's watch goes off.

				  MONTY
		Baby, it's eight o'clock.

	Marcella gets up.

				  MARCELLA
		Thanks, Monty.

	She tousles Monty's hair on the way to the truck.

	INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

	Marcella gets in. She shuts the door and dials the phone.

				  MARCELLA
		Hey there, how'd it go?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT - INTERCUT

	Martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel.

				  MARTIN
		It isn't done.

	Marcella pauses, taking this in.

				  MARCELLA
		This is not good.

				  MARTIN
		I'll do it tomorrow.

	Marcella considers this.

				  MARCELLA
		What's it look like?

				  MARTIN
		It's fine.

				  MARCELLA
		You haven't looked at the dossier.

				  MARTIN
			(a little defensive)
		I've looked at it.

	Martin eyes the vent.

				  MARCELLA
		You have.

				  MARTIN
		Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing 
		remarkable about it at all.

				  MARCELLA
		I have to call the client and give 
		them a reason why you're late.

				  MARTIN
		Tell them my house exploded.

	Beat. Marcella doesn't know what to make of this.

				  MARCELLA
		I'll call them and tell them you're 
		taking your time. Being a 
		professional.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if 
		you could find out why they double-
		booked the job, and who is trying to 
		kill me, and call me back-- that's 
		be great.

				  MARCELLA
		Will do.

	Martin hangs up. He moves up to the air vent, deciding to 
	get down to business. He pries it open, and withdraws his 
	briefcase, putting it down on the bed and propping it open. 
	He looks at the unopened dossier for a moment, flips it over 
	in his hands, and tosses it on the bed.

	BRIEFCASE

	We catch a glimpse of Martin's weapons. Martin picks up the 
	envelope and is about to tear the seal when

	THE PHONE RINGS

	Martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver.

				  DEBI
			(filtered)
		Are you there?

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Pick me up at my father's house at 
		around seven. And don't be late this 
		time.

	Beat.

				  DEBI
		Hello...?

				  MARTIN
		This night, this reunion will be an 
		important step in our relationship.

				  DEBI
		You're fucking psycho.

				  MARTIN
		Don't rush to judgement until all 
		the facts are in.

	She hangs up. Martin smiles and replaces the receiver. He 
	turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed.

	GUNS, BULLETS, ETC.

	What has been his life is beginning to look more like death 
	to him. He places the envelope in the case, then returns the 
	case to its hiding place.

	EXT. DINER - DAY

	Lardner and McCullers stake out Martin from the Country Squire 
	across the street.

				  MCCULLERS
		I wish he'd do his job already so we 
		could do our job.

				  LARDNER
		We can't do our job unless he does 
		his job.

				  MCCULLERS
		Why don't we just do his job then, 
		so we can do our job, and get the 
		fuck out of here.

				  LARDNER
		Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded 
		killer.

				  MCCULLERS
		Wait a minute--

				  LARDNER
		-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, 
		but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until 
		a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and 
		then you come in and kill the Bad 
		Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.

				  MCCULLERS
		So if we do his job, we're the bad 
		guys. If we do our job, we're the 
		good guys.

				  LARDNER
		Yup.

	They both laugh, as if at some great joke. Their laughter is 
	caught short by the sight of

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS' POV

				  GROCER
		moving into the diner.

	INT. DINER - LATE MORNING

	Martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets 
	into an apple juice and looking out the window.

	GROCER

	slides into the booth, across from Martin.

	MARTIN AND GROCER

	Martin draws a nasty little PPK pistol from his waist, and 
	levels it at Grocer under the table-- but Grocer is already 
	drawing his pistol down there, and there is an instant Mexican 
	breakfast stand-off.

				  GROCER
		Easy, tiger.

	A waitress approaches.

				  WAITRESS
		Hi. Welcome to B.I. McCafferty's. My 
		name is Melanie and I'll be your 
		server this morning. Let me tell you 
		about some of our specials. Today we 
		have the "Alfalfa on My Mind," our 
		feature omelette. And there's our 
		"Gatsby's West Egg Omelette." And if 
		you're in the mood for something 
		different there's the "I left my 
		heart in San Franchezie."

	Martin and Grocer's eyes remain locked.

				  GROCER
		I want two eggs poached, hash brown 
		well-done. English muffin for the 
		bread. And a coffee.

				  MARTIN
		Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg-
		white omelette.

				  WAITRESS
		What would you like in the omelette?

				  MARTIN
		Nothing in the omelette. Nothing at 
		all.

	The waitress nods pertly and leaves.

				  GROCER
			(re: the omelette)
		Come on, live a little. I'm sorry 
		about the incident yesterday.

				  MARTIN
		No harm no foul.

				  GROCER
		A little misunderstanding among my 
		associates.

	Beat.

				  GROCER
		I told them to kill you and they 
		didn't.

				  MARTIN
		Hard to get good help these days.

				  GROCER
		But since we're both here, I think 
		it's time to take a fresh look at 
		our relationship.

				  MARTIN
		I didn't get into this business to 
		have "associates." And I don't want 
		to join your Goddamned union. "Loner--
		" "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my 
		own." That's the whole point. Why 
		don't you become a cop, or something. 
		You can drink coffee in the morning... 
		with friends!

	Grocer looks a little hurt.

				  MARTIN
			(easing up)
		Look, this is a one-on-one business... 
		Every time you get to know people, 
		bad things happen. If it'll make you 
		feel any better, this is my last 
		job. So what do you say we put our 
		guns away and forget the whole damn 
		thing.

	Grocer loses it.

				  GROCER
		Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, 
		everything's regulated!

	Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself.

				  MARTIN
		No deal.

				  GROCER
		Fine. But we're not going to let you 
		do your job. Because we're gonna do 
		it. And then, after we do your job, 
		we're gonna do another little job...

				  MARTIN
			(Wry)
		Is that right?

				  GROCER
		Yeah-- after I shoot you through the 
		fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you 
		in the bullethole.

				  MARTIN
		Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

	INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses 
	it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears 
	a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile...

				  MARTIN
			(trying on smile)
		Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell 
		couch insurance. I test-market 
		positive thinking. I lead a weekend 
		men's group, actually. We specialize 
		in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are 
		you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh.
			(sarcastic)
		Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me?  
		I'm not married, I have no kids and 
		I'd blow your brains out if someone 
		paid me enough... So how've you been? 
		Where do you stand on The Issues? 
		Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, 
		shamed, blahblahblahblah--

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

	Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, 
	holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front 
	steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers.

				  DEBI
		Flowers. That's funny.

				  MARTIN
		As long as I get the laugh.

				  DEBI
			(taking them)
		Here. Let me put these in some rubbing 
		alcohol.

	She backs into the house, and he follows.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this 
	atavistic ritual.

				  MARTIN
		You look beautiful.

				  DEBI
		Okay... Hold on...

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of 
	MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a 
	Barcolounger.

				  DEBI (V.O.)
		...Let me get my coat.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

	DEBI

	moves up the stairs and disappears.

	MARTIN

	looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the 
	den.

	INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

	Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. 
	He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of 
	hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to 
	Martin.

				  MARTIN
		Good evening, Mr. Newberry.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Good evening, Mr. Blank.

				  MARTIN
		How are you? How's business?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Martin, I don't know where you've 
		been since you abandoned my daughter 
		ten years ago, and I don't care. It 
		was good that you left, and I'm glad 
		you did. So what do you want to talk 
		about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe 
		I had you figured wrong.

				  MARTIN
		How's that?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		I visualized you, in a haze, as one 
		of the slackster, flannel-wearing, 
		coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been 
		seeing in Newsweek.

				  MARTIN
		I took the other road. I'm more of a 
		self-reflective young lion who does 
		business with lead-pipe cruelty and 
		goes home to drink light beer in 
		milky-eyes isolation. I love sports 
		and sex and have no real relationships 
		with anyone. And you?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the 
		same old sell-out baby-boomer, 
		exploiting the oppressed I got shot 
		for at Kent State. But why don't we 
		have a drink and forget the whole 
		thing?

	Newberry lays down his book, and moves behind the wet bar.

				  MARTIN
		Why not?

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		So what are you doing with your life 
		now, son?

				  MARTIN
		I'm a professional killer.

				  MR. NEWBERRY
		That's good.

	Debi's footsteps are heard coming down the stairs.

				  DEBI (O.S.)
		Okay

	Mr. Newberry watches Martin turn and walk out of the room.

	EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE

	Martin and Debi pull away from the curb.

	INT. CAR - DUSK

	Martin and Debi drive through that to Debi is town, and to 
	Martin is a widening pool of quicksand.

				  MARTIN
		Do you want to get a drink first?

				  DEBI
		I think they'll probably have booze 
		there.

				  MARTIN
		Right.

	Martin's right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit. He grips 
	it tighter. Suddenly, Martin turns the wheel and pulls into 
	a gas station parking lot, halting next to a pay phone.

				  MARTIN
		I'll just be a second.

	Debi nods, a little confused but going with it.

				  DEBI
		Okay...

	EXT. PAYPHONE - MINUTES LATER

	Martin stands at the kiosk next to the Town Car, mid-
	conversation.

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		...Well, I didn't kill anyone, but 
		someone tried to kill me and the guy 
		in the middle got killed. So if I 
		see that guy again I'm definitely 
		going to kill him, but I won't kill 
		anyone else. Oh, except for the guy 
		I was sent here to kill. I don't 
		know...

	INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

	Oatman treats his patient.

				  DR. OATMAN
		What else? Say more.

				  MARTIN
		Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm 
		on my way to the reunion.

	In the background, Lardner and McCullers drive past the 
	station.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Okay. Repeat this after me.

				  MARTIN
		Out Loud?

	Martin looks to Debi. She looks up and smiles. We hear Dr. 
	Oatman's command, Martin mumbles them back.

				  MARTIN
		...I am at home with the me. I am 
		rooted in me, who is on this 
		adventure.

				  DR. OATMAN
		Take a deep breath and realize, that 
		this is me breathing.

				  MARTIN
		This is me breating.

	Martin takes in a few breaths.

				  MARITN
		Alright, look. I gotta go.

				  DR. OATMAN
		And don't kill anyone.

				  MARTIN
		Right. Don't kill anyone...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Felix rummages delicately around the room. He goes to the

	NIGHTSTAND

	The reunion invite.

	FELIX

	picks it up and scans it.

	EXT. GROSSE POINT HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK

	Lardner and McCullers sit it the parking lot. They watch 
	Martin and Debi pull into a space.

				  LARDNER
		He's falling for her. Look at him.

				  MCCULLERS
		He using her.

				  LARDNER
		You're wrong. Look at his face.

				  MCCULLERS
		One cannot love and kill.

				  LARDNER
			(defensive)
		I love. I kill.

	MARTIN AND DEBI

	climb out of the car. Martin, breathing deeply and wiping 
	his sweaty palms, leans against the car and tries to calm 
	himself. Eighties music echoes from the gym.

				  MARTIN
			(to himself)
		Shoulda brought my gun.

				  DEBI
		What?

	He pulls himself off the car and heads toward

	GROSSE POINTE HIGH SCHOOL

	A sprawling red-brick Gothic structure with many wings. It 
	is topped by church-like towers. It's scary.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Martin and Debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. 
	A benevolent Ronald Reagan hangs crookedly above. Basketball 
	nets are swung back, draped with crepe. Lights are half-low 
	and the music is loud. Alumni are dancing.

				  ARLENE
		Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott-
		Joseph.

				  MARTIN
		I'm Martin Blank.

				  DEBI
		Debi Newberry.

	Debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands 
	Martin. Arlene rises from a card table. They have little to 
	say. Martin wasn't part of her crowd.

				  ARLENE
		Marty, you haven't changed a bit!

				  MARTIN
		Don't say that.

	Arlene gives him a NAMETAG. As a special torture, the tags 
	have YEARBOOK PHOTOS. Martin looks at the name tag 
	uncomfortably.

				  ARLENE
		We had pictures put on, that way 
		everybody knows who everybody was!

				  MARTIN
		Wonderful.

				  ARLENE
		So, what are you doing now?

				  MARTIN
		Whatever I can get away with.

	She smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the 
	next arrival. Martin moves off...

				  ARLENE
			(to the next person)
		Isn't it cute. It's so everybody 
		knows who everybody was!

	He circles the crowded gym. Looking for familiar faces. He 
	stops at the open bar.

				  BATENDER
		What can I make you?

				  MARTIN
		Beer.

	The bartender gets him a beer. Martin recognizes a guy at 
	the bar. He is well-appointed and shiny. He is KEN ALDRIDGE.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Ken. How have you been?

				  KEN
			(glancing at Martin's 
			name tag)
		Hello Martin. How have you been?

				  MARTIN
		Not bad. You?

	Bob Destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. Eye 
	contact is made.

				  KEN
		Hello, Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Hey, Bob.

	Bob turns slightly toward them. They continue in their 
	conversation.

				  KEN
		I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice 
		& Fromeyer.

				  MARTIN
		That sounds pretty interesting...

	Bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.

				  KEN
		Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. 
		Some property. Some personal injury.

				  MARTIN
		Those all seem kind of related...

	Bob takes another drink and mopes off, Martin watches him 
	go.

				  MARTIN
		Tragedy makes you thirsty.

	Ken chuckles. The bartender arrives with the bottle. Martin 
	grabs it and begins to move off.

				  MARTIN
		Well... I have to take this over to 
		Debi.

				  KEN
		Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... 
		here's a special one. For top-shelf 
		clients.

	Ken hands Martin a Monte Blanc pen with Ken's title and 
	business address printed on the shaft. Martin reads it and 
	puts it in his kerchief pocket.

				  MARTIN
		Thanks.

	Ken goes back to listening to the Guys at the bar.

	MARTIN

	makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well-wishers. TERRY 
	emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts 
	Martin. His angst is barely under control as he sidles up to 
	Martin.

				  TERRY
		I don't know, Blank, all these fucking 
		people, driving me crazy. Look at 
		them over there, memorializing old 
		times, acting all like it was 
		something "life-changing." And the 
		people in the National Honor Society? 
		The name tags?

	Martin shrugs.

				  TERRY
		They have special blue starts on 
		them like it fucking matters now 
		that they were in the honor club ten 
		years ago. I'm getting fucking 
		nauseous from all this sentimental 
		bullshit. It's making me sick.

	Terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. Martin reads this 
	man's nametag.

				  MARTIN
		Why are you here... Terry?

	Terry turns on a dime.

				  TERRY
		I wanted to see a couple people. But 
		I don't want to talk about the old 
		days... What did we have together, 
		Martin? Typing?

				  MARTIN
			(remembering)
		Drafting.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking 
		class. But I appreciate you helping 
		me out, man.

				  MARTIN
		Don't mention it.

				  TERRY
		Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try 
		and get out of here, man. I'll see 
		you later.

	Terry slinks off.

	BAR - SAME

	Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns 
	to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN 
	KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy.

				  DAN
		Bob. Bob Destephano.

				  BOB
		What?

				  DAN
		I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.

				  BOB
		Computer guy.

				  DAN
		Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's 
		dealership the other day.

				  BOB
		I sell BMW's. What do you do?

				  DAN
		Not much, actually. My software 
		company just went public so I'm 
		just... hanging out, really.

	There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his 
	drunken hand at relating...

				  BOB
		Remember high school?

				  DAN
		Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us 
		up in the grandstands?

	Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks 
	off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.

	INT. GYM - LATER

	Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others 
	in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are 
	arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, 
	is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked 
	out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of 
	Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non-
	stop sports conversation.

				  MIKE
		...You gotta hold the fans 
		responsible, though, Dennis, because 
		they're the ones putting up with the 
		mediocre product.

				  DENNIS
		I guess, though, you know, if you 
		look at it Mike, that park is a 
		beautiful park, I've gone to that 
		park many times - I've had the 
		greatest time of my life at that 
		ballpark and let's face it, I tell 
		you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, 
		if you're having the fun you should 
		be having at Tigers Stadium, you 
		don't even know what the hell's going 
		on anyway...

	They both crack up at this.

	ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI

				  DARIUS
		Have you two been together since 
		high school?

				  DEBI
		No--

				  MARTIN
		--Yes. Actually we just bought that 
		little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine 
		Avenue... Debi's a social worker and 
		I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--

				  DEBI
		We haven't seen each other since 
		high school.

				  DARIUS
		I figured. You two look too happy 
		together. I shouldn't say that though, 
		I'm married... So, Martin-- what are 
		you up to these days? What do you do 
		for a living?

	Debi perks up; this should be interesting.

				  MARTIN
		I'm in pro-active international 
		relations. It's a very specialized 
		company. We execute economic 
		investment opportunities. Sort of 
		economic clean-up... with an emphasis 
		on personnel. It's boring, you know, 
		it's boring. I don't like to talk 
		about it because I don't think what 
		a man does necessarily reflects who 
		he is...

	Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. 
	Martin may be in trouble.

				  MARTIN
		...I've always tried to refrain from 
		a black-and-white moral lexicon--you 
		know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've 
		been more interested in the gray 
		areas.

	Silence. Martin pushes on.

				  MARTIN
		But that's no way to live. I guess 
		you've got to just take the leap of 
		faith. Believe in something. Fuck 
		it.

				  DARIUS
		Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you 
		happy?

				  MARTIN
		I just have to close this one last 
		account. I'd like to just stop now, 
		today, but I can't... It's a step in 
		the right direction.

				  DEBI
		I don't know, Martin. It sounds like 
		you're feeling compromised. Live the 
		way you want. The only thing that's 
		inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. 
		That's the biggest cop-out there is.

	Nods of assent come from around the table. A brief silence, 
	and then...

				  AMY
		But wait. I still don't understand 
		what you do.

				  MARTIN
		I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

	Debi suppresses a laugh.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		Yes I do.

				  AMY
		You don't...

				  MARTIN
		In the corporate offices.

				  AMY
		Oh... really?

				  MARTIN
		Yeah...

				  AMY
		What do you do?

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits to the Southland.

				  AMY
		You do not.

				  MARTIN
		It's what I do.

				  AMY
		You're so funny...

				  MARTIN
		I sell biscuits and gravy all over 
		the Southland--

				  AMY
		--Stop it--

				  MARTIN
		You know those horsey biscuit gravy 
		packets? I move all of those--

				  AMY
		--No.

				  MARTIN
		Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's 
		and just change them to special 
		barbecue sauce.

	Across the table from Martin and Debi, Dennis turns to Darius.

				  DENNIS
		What do you think about black coaching 
		in the NFL, Darius? Because I think 
		it's great.

				  DARIUS
		I don't pay much attention to 
		football.

				  MIKE
		I have to agree with you Dennis. 
		It's good to see that the owners are 
		willing to put the franchise behind 
		a black head coach or QB when for 
		years in the league they've been 
		kept out of the thinking positions 
		and relegated mainly to the physical 
		game.

				  DENNIS
		But now, you see, you have Warren 
		Moon at the helm, Cunningham, Art 
		Shell, and the coach up at 
		Minnesota...

				  MIKE
		Dennis Green. And if you remember, 
		Doug Williams was the first black 
		man to prove that on a Superbowl 
		Sunday.

	Amy leans in to Martin.

				  AMY
			(to Martin)
		I'm teaching art at Cedar Junior 
		High School.

				  DENNIS
		...Yeah, listen. Where do you stand 
		on this whole Louis Farrakhan 
		issue...?

				  DARIUS
			(facetious)
		I'm a De Klerk man myself.

	Debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.

				  DEBI
		I'm going over to play some tunes.

	Martin watches her walk away.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - LATER

	Dan Koretzky sits with two other FORMER-SQUARES-turned-
	handsome-fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with 
	early investment in Microsoft.

	Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. 
	He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back.

	GROUP OF MEN

				  DAN
		Look at her. There it is. Jenny 
		Slater. The finest thing that ever 
		walked these halls.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		I believe she married the state of 
		Maine.

				  DAN
		Yeah, he's around here somewhere. 
		What a shame. She would have looked 
		great in my fucking Bentley.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only 
		was she as fine, if not finer, than 
		Slater, but she had the "bad girl" 
		thing going for her. And the red 
		hair. C'mon.

				  DAN
		She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #2
		You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti 
		was the finest. No question about 
		it.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. 
		All named Jenny...

				  DAN
		You know what I'm really hoping? 
		That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And 
		she's twenty-eight--

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		--she's got half the state of Maine--

				  DAN
		She's twenty-eight years old, with 
		two kids, she's still really really 
		fine, and I see her at a bookstore 
		or something, and she sees me for 
		what I was then, and what I am now: 
		the redemption for all her failure.

				  FORMER-SQUARE #3
		You mean the redemption for all your 
		failure.

	They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating 
	on Debi.

	BOB DESTEPHANO

	Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan.

								   CUT TO:

	INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER

	Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay 
	booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric 
	game.

				  DEBI
		Which would you rather...?

				  MARTIN
		Okay... Would you rather... commit 
		yourself sexually to a four-by-nine 
		cell with former President George 
		Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a 
		super-model for a month, or make 
		love to a otter on crank for a week?

				  DEBI
		Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, 
		clearly! I'd let the little beast 
		scratch and claw all he wants... 
		Okay. Would you rather make love to 
		the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--

				  MARTIN
		--She's not dead---

				  DEBI
		It's just a game...! Alright. Candied 
		Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest 
		across the desert with a fully 
		digested crab apple in your mouth?

				  MARTIN
		Wow. I have to give this some thought.

				  DEBI
		No time.

				  MARTIN
		Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

	STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified 
	and unsure at what she's heard.

				  STACEY
		Marty! Debi! How are you! So many 
		people came, but I never expected to 
		see you Marty. Or you Debi... I 
		mean... because of what your 
		divorce... I didn't mean to say that. 
		I just meant you look so good.

				  DEBI
		Thank you.

				  STACEY
		Do you think you could play "Too 
		Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo?

				  DEBI
		Stacey, why don't you come up here 
		and take over for a little while?

				  STACEY
		I'd love to.

	Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as 
	Martin and Debi make their way down.

				  DEBI
			(to Martin)
		Everybody thinks they know me now 
		that I'm divorced.

	She leads Martin toward the exit.

				  DEBI
		It's time to see you in private.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Martin and Debi walk down the hallway, alone together.

				  MARTIN
		Even though I left, you never left 
		me. Not just memory but a substance 
		in my blood.

				  DEBI
			(smiling)
		Like heroin?

				  MARTIN
		Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.

				  DEBI
			(enjoying this)
		Like love?

				  MARTIN
		Could be. The physical substance of 
		love.

	Debi stops.

				  DEBI
		I'll accept that. Follow me.

	Together they move into what appears to be the Nurse's Office, 
	and close the door behind them.

	INT. NURSE'S OFFICE

	Martin and Debi make wild banshee love.

	EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers watch Felix into the gym.

				  MCCULLERS
		Looks like someone keeps trying to 
		do our job for us.

				  LARDNER
		If he does our job, he's our job.

				  MCCULLERS
		I get it.

	INT. GYM - SAME

	FELIX

	steps through the doorway he's standing in and strolls into 
	the crowded gym. He wears the standard khaki-pants-blue-blazer 
	combo, with no nametag. He's clearly too old for the class 
	of 1984.

	INT. HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin and Debi come out of the Nurse's Office. The post-
	coital mood is broken as they hear The Human League's "Don't 
	You Want Me, Baby?"  blasting from the gym. Martin and Debi 
	tune in on the song for a moment, unhappy at remembering 
	that particular moment in pop music history. Debi looks to 
	Martin, something must be done about it.

				  DEBI
		I'll be right back....

	Debi kisses him. They split up. Martin walks off, the happiest 
	we've seen him....

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

	Bob and several others from the muscle-to-fat crew play a 
	drunken scrimmage with a papier-mache table ornament footbal 
	that is coming unwound. Bob quarterbacks and begins to recite 
	a long, complicated, and forgotten play. Martin approaches 
	from behind Bob and glides through the ad-hoc line-up, 
	continuing down the hall. Bob yells "hike" as he stares after 
	Martin, distracted. Bob's rushed upon and sacked. He lets 
	the papier-mache ball drop and crack on the floor.

	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

	Martin walks down a silent, deserted hall of lockers and 
	classroom doors. The only sounds are his footsteps and the 
	echoed strains of Iggy Pop's "Wild Child" from the distant 
	gym. He stops at locker number 1963 and flips the dial: Right-
	back left-right again. It opens. He pops up the steel false 
	ceiling in the empty locker, fishes his hand in the opening, 
	and withdraws what he is looking for: an ancient joint. He 
	holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer. He 
	grinds it into dust in his hand.

	INT. HALLWAY

	Debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall, the music 
	changed for the better.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Martin senses he is not alone. He turns to find Bob 
	Destephano. The big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs 
	slightly when he speaks. Bob is looking sad and scary. He 
	leans into Martin

				  BOB
		So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that 
		shit again?

				  MARTIN
		Fine, Bob. How are you?

				  BOB
		Never better.

				  MARTIN
		Really?

	Bob crumbles.

				  BOB
		Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing 
		adds up to nothing... you work your 
		whole life, day in and day out-- try 
		to make sense of it all. One day 
		you're twenty-seven and what do you 
		get to show for it...

				  MARTIN
		You could've been a contender, huh?

	Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without 
	the use of cliches.

				  BOB
		Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how 
		smart you are with my foot up your 
		ass! I'm gonna kick your ass!

	Martin steps to Bob.

				  MARTIN
		Why would you want to hit me, Bob? 
		Do you really believe that there's 
		some stored up conflict that needs 
		resolution between us? We don't exist. 
		There's nothing between us. So who 
		do you want to hit, Bob? It's not 
		me.

	Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated.

				  BOB
		What am I gonna do?

				  MARTIN
		What do you want to do?

				  BOB
		I want to be an actor.

				  MARTIN
		Then express yourself, Bob.

	Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself.

				  MARTIN
			(catching him)
		Be honest...

	Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, 
	then stops abruptly, and smiles.

				  BOB
		Later, Martin.

	Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin 
	watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the 
	doors of a stairwell, disappearing.

	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the 
	stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her 
	but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and 
	quickens her pace up the stairs...

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and 
	relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST 
	from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was 
	a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand 
	withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops 
	the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of 
	his attacker--

	FELIX

	impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back.

	MARTIN AND FELIX

	are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front 
	of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The 
	stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the 
	sound. His eyes lock onto

	DEBI

	who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees.

	MARTIN

	looks back at

	FELIX

	Dead.

	THE FLOOR

	A growing pool of blood.

	MARTIN

	Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. 
	Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming

		 "SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1"

	MARTIN

	rips it down from the wall with his free hand, wraps it around 
	Felix, stuffs the body into his open locker, and slams it 
	shut. He pulls off his shoes and socks, puts a sock over 
	each hand like mittens, and wipes up the small pool of blood. 
	He stuffs the socks into his pockets, takes off down the 
	hall, and bangs through the doors.

	INT. GYM - GRANDSTANDS - MOMENTS LATER

	Martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands 
	looking for Debi below. She is nowhere to be found. He scans 
	the party in progress-- It is the same frame of image as the 
	one in Oatman's office. In the middle of the floor, Terry 
	slowly turns up to meet Martin's eyes.

	MARTIN

	pulls the doors shut, and takes off down the hall.

	INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens his locker, withdraws the corpse, and hefts it 
	over his shoulder.

	INT. STAIRWELL - A MINUTE LATER

	Brick-walled, darkly lit, and narrow. Martin bounds down the 
	steep steps with his load.

	INT. BASEMENT LOCKER ROOM HALLWAY - MINUTE LATER

	Martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him. He kicks 
	through it and dumps Felix into a canvas laundry cart on 
	casters and begins rolling.

	INT. PUMP AND FURNACE ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

	The door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind 
	Martin. He negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops 
	next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool. He pauses 
	and looks to the ceiling: the music from the reunion pulses 
	into the floor above him. Martin picks up a large metal bar 
	and works open the door on the hulking cast-iron furnace. A 
	white-hot blaze roars within.

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	The party is winding down. A harried-looking Martin walks in 
	and looks around once more for Debi-- nothing.

	MARTIN'S POV

	of the Deejay booth. It is empty.

	He moves over to the bar and joins Ken Aldridge. He motions 
	to the bartender who opens a beer for him.

				  MARTIN
		Have you seen Debi Newberry?

				  KEN
		Nope.

	They both look around at the last of the reunion.

				  KEN
		The more things change, the more 
		they Goddamned well stay the same.

				  MARTIN
		I guess.

	Before Ken can get started again...

				  MARTIN
		Take care of yourself, Ken. Thanks 
		for the pen.

	Martin walks out of the gym.

	EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

	Paul is leaning against his Beemer, having a smoke.

				  PAUL
		What the hell happened to you?

				  MARTIN
		I was catching up with Bob Destephano.

				  PAUL
		As long as you had a good time.

	Beat. Martin scans the lot for sign of Debi.

				  PAUL
		What now? Chase the girl?

	There is a beat of silence. Nothing seems worth saying.

				  MARTIN
		It didn't work out.

				  PAUL
		That's too bad.

				  MARTIN
		I have to get my head back into my 
		work.

				  PAUL
		Work's good for the soul.

	Martin gets up to leave.

				  MARTIN
		When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.

				  PAUL
		See you in ten years.

	Paul watches him leave. He almost stops him, but thinks better 
	of it.

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - NIGHT

	Martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed.

	MARTIN PULLS

	THE DOSSIER from the briefcase. It's seal is broken, but the 
	contents remain enclosed... He withdraws the package and 
	dumps the contents on the bed. His face registers muted shock.

				  MARTIN
		Dumb fucking luck...

	THE CONTENTS

	include various photos of MR. NEWBERRY, Mr. Newberry with 
	Debi, and the house. The photos are mingled with official-
	looking papers including credit reports, medical records, 
	etc... Newberry's life.

	He cocks his head toward the door anticipating a... KNOCK. 
	He freezes, then plucks a gun tapped under a desk, and moves 
	toward the door, pointing. Halfway to the door, his face and 
	body slacken. He lobs the gun onto the bed. With everything 
	gone wrong, there is nothing left to defend. He goes to the 
	door and opens it, body relaxed, expecting a bullet...

	Debi moves past him into the room. She is completely calm.

				  DEBI
		He was trying to kill you, right!

				  MARTIN
		Yes.

				  DEBI
		Not the other way around...?

				  MARTIN
		No.

				  DEBI
		Is it something you've done?

				  MARTIN
		It's something I do...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...Professionally...

	Beat.

				  MARTIN
		...About five years now.

				  DEBI
			(stunned)
		Get the fuck outta here.

				  MARTIN
		Seriously, when I left, I joined the 
		Army and took the service exam. They 
		found my psych results fit a certain 
		profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" 
		would be the best way to describe 
		it... I was loaned out to a CIA-
		sponsored program. It's called 
		"mechanical operations." We sort of 
		found each other...

				  DEBI
		You're a government spook?

	Martin says nothing.

				  MARTIN
		I was, but no... yes... I was before, 
		but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, 
		really. The idea of governments, 
		nations, it's mostly a public 
		relations theory at this point, 
		anyway. But I'll tell you something, 
		until about five months ago, I really 
		enjoyed my work.

				  DEBI
		Jesus Christ!

				  MARTIN
		Then I started losing my taste for 
		it. Which usually means your time is 
		up. But then I realized it was 
		something entirely different... I 
		started getting the sneaking, dark 
		suspicion that maybe there was... 
		meaning to life.

				  DEBI
		Okay. Great, Martin, that's just 
		great. Meaning to life... Mmm....

				  MARTIN
		Like, that there's a point? An organic 
		connection between all living things.

				  DEBI
		Let me help you along, Martin. You're 
		a sociopath!

				  MARTIN
			(defensive)
		A sociopath kills for no reason. I 
		kill for money.

				  DEBI
		You never could have kept this from 
		me.

				  MARTIN
		I was leaving.

				  DEBI
		That's probably a good idea.

				  MARTIN
		Will you come with me?

				  DEBI
		I'm staying here.

				  MARTIN
		What if I come back?

				  DEBI
		I'll hide.

	She goes for the door.

				  MARTIN
		Don't go.

	She stops at the door. Slowly, she turns.

				  DEBI
		You don't get to have me. You are a 
		monster, I'm a human being. We're 
		not going to mate.

				  MARTIN
		You don't understand...

				  DEBI
		That's because I speak human, and 
		you speak monster.

	Debi bolts out of the room. Martin is left alone.

	Martin looks over at his gear on the bed. After a beat, he 
	walks slowly over and surveys his tools. He picks up a 
	cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons, absently 
	singing to himself...

				  MARTIN
		"What's up Doc? What's cookin'? What's 
		up Doc, are you lookin'...?

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - DAWN

	Morning light comes through the slit in the curtains, picking 
	up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the 
	bed, almost geometrically spaced. Martin lifts one at a time, 
	checking their bores and actions...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - MORNING

	Lardner and McCullers gear up. They each finish loading the 
	last of many clips...

	EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - MORNING

	Grocer and Company, not in a Ford Passenger Van, veer off 
	onto an exit ramp. Grocer has assembled a team of about nine. 
	They draw different guns from their kit bags and begin 
	loading...

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers jam clips into their service autos and 
	knock the slides...

	INT. MARTIN'S SUITE - SAME

	Martin finished loading his guns, and puts them in his case. 
	He shuts it and moves for the door. On the way out he stops 
	and looks himself in the mirror before exiting.

	EXT. THREE DIFFERENT ROADS - INTERCUT

	Each car whooshes by camera, on its way to the inevitable...

	INT. EASTWEST HOLDING COMPANY - INTERCUT

	Marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear, 
	and holds a two-gallon gas can. She moves from room to room 
	pouring gasoline onto the computers, desks, and piles of 
	paper stacked on the floor. She adds a splash to her copy of 
	"Women Who Run With the Wolves."

				  MARCELLA
		I'm bringing down the office now.

	She picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor. 
	It's cathartic.

	INTERCUT WITH MARTIN IN THE TOWN CAR -

				  MARTIN
		I'll put things right. Then I'll 
		find you.

	Silence on the line.

				  MARCELLA
			(apprehensive)
		Uh... why?

	Martin finishes his weapons check, and pulls out the dossier.

				  MARTIN
		Don't worry. I left you a little 
		something under your desk.

	Martin hangs up.

	Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink-
	wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so.

				  MARCELLA
		All right!!

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR

	Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the 
	distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, 
	away from him.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching 
	Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares 
	to blow Newberry's head off.

	INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME

	As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, 
	he accelerates.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry.

				  GROCER
		Oh shit...

	EXT. ROAD - SAME

	Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing 
	down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed.

	INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

	Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As 
	the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin 
	swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next 
	to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, 
	Newberry opens the passenger door.

				  NEWBERRY
		What the fuck is the matter with 
		you?!

				  MARTIN
		Well, I was hired to kill you. It's 
		what I do, and come to think of it, 
		I told you that, but... Okay. I'm 
		not going to do it. Get in the car.

	He does. They drive on.

				  MARTIN
		It's either because I'm in love with 
		your daughter, or because I have a 
		new-found respect for life. Or both. 
		But I don't know.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer and company watch in amazement.

	GROCER'S P.O.V.

	of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded 
	driveway.

				  GROCER
		That punk is either in love with 
		that guy's daughter or he has new 
		found respect for life... Let's go.

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out 
	and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is 
	shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element.

				  NEWBERRY
		Why? I build cars! They're paying 
		you to kill me? Why?

				  MARTIN
		It was a cost-cutting effort. They 
		can't afford a recall.

				  NEWBERRY
		It was a leaky sunroof! A design 
		flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! 
		You want to kill me because of that?

				  MARTIN
		It's not me! Why does everybody think 
		it's personal?!

	They go through the front door and shut it behind them.

	INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME

	Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway.

	INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers approach the scene. They get within 
	viewing distance in time to see Grocer's Town Car turn into 
	the driveway.

				  LARDNER
		We'll go in through the woods.

	INT. NEWBERRY HOUSE

	Martin's briefcase is open on the large oak table. The 
	contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table. 
	Newberry and Debi watch him, dumbstruck, as he draws a huge 
	Desert Eagle automatic and jerks back the slide. He turns to 
	Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was sitting in my house on prom 
		night wearing that Goddamned rented 
		tuxedo, a corsage in one hand, a 
		bottle of champagne in the other. So 
		I was just sitting there, and then 
		the whole night flashed before my 
		eyes, and it struck me like a bullet 
		in the head-- I realized, finally, 
		and for the first time, that... I 
		wanted to kill somebody. So I figured 
		because I loved you so much, that'd 
		it'd be a good idea if I didn't see 
		you anymore. But now I'm different.

	He turns and points the gun at the front door and FIRES two 
	shots through it, leaving two baseball-size holes in the 
	door.

	Martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house. 
	Debi and Newberry run as fast as they can away from Martin. 
	Newberry opens the front door, preparing to rush out with 
	Debi. They stop at what they see:

	NEWBERRY'S & DEBI'S P.O.V.

	As ASSASSIN lies on the porch, shot dead through the door by 
	Martin. IN one hand is a gun, in the other is a Fuller Brush 
	kit. Two men, GROCER and an ASSASSIN, clamber out of van, 
	their guns rising up fast toward us.

	Debi pulls Newberry inside, slams the front door, and locks 
	it. They dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from 
	outside.

	INT. KITCHEN - SAME

	Martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening. 
	A barrel comes through and FIRES at Martin. Martin pulls 
	back behind the refrigerator and returns FIRE. An ASSASSIN 
	comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind 
	the cooking island. Martin, yelling back to Debi...

				  MARTIN
		I'm in love with you. I know we can 
		make this work!

	MARTIN

	rushes toward the island, grabbing an iron skillet off the 
	range, and holds it up like a crossing-guard stop sign. He 
	steps toward the hidden Assassin just as the Assassin rises 
	SHOOTING. The skillet takes two rounds before Martin hammers 
	the Assassin's head with it. Debi and Newberry arrive in the 
	kitchen.

	NEW ANGLE - LOW DUTCH

	Martin bashes the skillet into the Assassin's skull, which 
	is beyond our view. He rises spattered with blood and looks 
	at Debi.

				  MARTIN
		I was afraid to commit to a 
		relationship, but now I know I'm 
		ready to make it happen.

	Martin drops the skillet and grabs Newberry and Debi gently 
	be the wrists.

				  MARTIN
		I just need time to change.

	He ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back 
	stairs. He spins and FIRES twice back down the stairs at 
	another ASSASSIN coming up, blowing his arms off.

	HALLWAY

	He leads them quickly.

				  MARTIN
		It's not easy for me. I was raised 
		to close off, to control my 
		feelings...

	He takes them into a bedroom, and BLOWS AWAY, an ASSASSIN 
	coming in through the window, emptying his auto. Martin pushes 
	Debi and Newberry into an adjoining bathroom. He backs out 
	through the doorway.

				  MARTIN
		Lock the door.

	They do. Martin starts away, but stops to get something 
	straight.

				  MARTIN
		I wasn't raised in a loving 
		environment.
			(beat)
		But that's not an excuse. It's a 
		reason.

	INT. FOYER

	Martin corners the banister and springs half-way down the 
	stairs, then hears the front door begin to open.

				  MARTIN
		My soul was empty--

	Martin jams in another clip, and chambers a round. He sees 
	Grocer beginning to slip in.

				  MARTIN
		--and it's up to me to fill it.

	Martin FIRES the twelve-round clip into the door until the 
	slide locks back empty again. Grocer backs out fast. Martin 
	hears a gun REPORT from upstairs and moves back toward it, 
	tossing the spent weapon.

	INT. BEDROOM

	An ASSASSIN slams his body against the bathroom door while 
	Debi and Newberry scream from within. Martin flies at him. 
	The Assassin wheels on Martin FIRING. Martin pivots out of 
	the line of fire, still moving forward. He takes hold of 
	Assassin's neck and snaps it. Martin drops the corpse.

				  MARTIN
			(through the door)
		It's okay. It's Martin The door begins 
		to open revealing Debi and Newberry.

				  MARTIN
		I know what I do isn't moral, per 
		se, but if you could just look past 
		that, you'd see a man worth loving.

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		Don't listen to him, he's a 
		professional.

	Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled 
	voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues...

				  GROCER (O.S.)
		You're breaking my heart down here, 
		Blank. I can't shoot through the 
		tears.

	Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead 
	man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze 
	firefight...

	EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME

	Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, 
	about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window.

				  LARDNER
		Did you see Blank in there?

				  MCCULLERS
		No...

				  LARDNER
		Good. For a second there I thought 
		we were in trouble.

	INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS

	MARTIN

	reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading 
	up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to 
	FIRE, when they hear...

	LARDNER AND MCCULLERS

	power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, 
	ala Butch and Sundance.

	Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and 
	FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls 
	out of view.

	KITCHEN - INTERCUT

	GROCER

	heads up the back stairs.

	MARTIN

	works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the 
	kitchen.

	GROCER

	hears him and starts back down.

	Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes 
	out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as 
	Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, 
	crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the 
	air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining 
	room, still firing.

	C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION

	The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and 
	the slide on the auto locks back-- empty.

	NORMAL SPEED

	GROCER

	Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered 
	serving window, his flight carrying him past a television 
	that sits on a lazy susan.

	MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT

	Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite 
	side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in 
	the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the 
	counter above and between them.

	Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION

				  GROCER
		...How about I sell you two rounds 
		for a hundred grand a piece?

				  MARTIN
		Okay.

	Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it 
	into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter.

	BALLED CHECK

	sails over the television and comes down, bouncing off 
	Grocer's head and into his lap.

				  MARTIN
		There you go. I left it blank.

				  GROCER
		Excellent. Here they come.

	Grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi-automatic 
	and pushes the clip back into the gun. Grocer arcs the TWO 
	BULLETS into the air.

	MARTIN

	rises and springs at the television, gripping it. The TWO 
	BULLETS sail past his head.

	GROCER

	begins to rise from his side of the counter, cocking his 
	gun.

	MARTIN

	puts all his weight and motion behind the television. Martin 
	and the television careen off of the counter toward Grocer.

	GROCER

	gets off one round before

	MARTIN

	flies onto Grocer, smashing the seventy-five pound television 
	over his Goddamn head. Martin sails past the collision, 
	landing on his back in the dining room. He rolls over to see

	GROCER

	Body crumpled, neck is snapped, head encased in the shattered 
	picture tube. He is dead.

	MARTIN

	runs up the front stairs, retrieving the spent gun he 
	discarded earlier, and heads into the bedroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

	Martin opens the bathroom door. Inside, Debi sits on the 
	edge of the tub, her face in her hands. Newberry kneels with 
	his arms around her. Martin takes this in, and walks back 
	into the bedroom. Newberry stands and follows him out.

	MARTIN AND NEWBERRY

	MARTIN a bloody, tattered mess, wipes off the gun and puts 
	it into Newberry's hand. Newberry, in total shock, grips it. 
	Martin looks past Newberry.

	MARTIN'S P.O.V.

	Of Debi, head in hands.

				  MARTIN (V.O.)
		Debi... will you marry me?

	Debi doesn't look up. After a moment, she reaches out, head 
	still down, and closes the bathroom door...

	INT. RADIO STATION - DAY

	Outside is a Michigan autumn. Debi sits at her console, 
	bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune...

				  DEBI
		This is WRFN Radio Free Newberry 
		cause that's what it does. Bringing 
		you New Ones for the Nineties, a 
		fresh new format designed to pull 
		you out of what's come before, and 
		reel you into what's coming soon--

	THE PHONE CONSOLE

	lights up with an incoming cal...

				  DEBI
		I tell you what's coming soon for 
		me, or at least what I dreamed this 
		morning in that weird time just before 
		you actually wake up. But first this 
		commercial. Back after this...

	She pushes a couple of buttons, slaps a cartridge in a player, 
	and answers the phone. We hear the commercial over the studio 
	monitor:

				  ANNOUNCER
		Don't miss the show of the season at 
		Bilkin Community Center! "Brigadoon!" 
		A musical for all ages! "Brigadoon," 
		starring Carol Plummer, Thomas 
		Canchola, Bob Destephano, and Lee 
		Ordman!...

	Debi picks up the phone.

				  DEBI
		RFN...

	Her face goes slack as she listens... not good, not bad... 
	Then she hangs up slowly. The commercial ends. A moment of 
	dead air, then she snaps to.

				  DEBI
		Hey out there... Okay... I'm going 
		to finish up that fantasy later. 
		First I'll give you an hour of nonstop 
		music... If I don't come back on 
		after that-- well, nevermind.

	Debi turns on a reel-to-reel, and leaves.

	EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

	Debi pulls up and gets out. She begins toward the door but 
	stops dead when she sees

	MARTIN

	sitting on the front steps.

	Debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the 
	porch. They sit, gazing out over the grass and trees beyond. 
	After a while...

				  DEBI
		This will never work out.

	She turns to him, serious.

				  DEBI
		You kill people.
			(beat)

				  MARTIN
		I have no illusions about the future. 
		What is, is. We make choices. And we 
		become the sum total of our choices. 
		I can live with that.

				  DEBI
		Other people can't.

	Martin looks at her earnestly... And smiles ever so slightly. 
	She does the same, and then just a little wider. He the same. 
	They turn back out to face the lawn, and they share a laugh...

          HIBERNATING GROUNDHOGS
          A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow
          sleeping off the end of a long winter.

          EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING

          The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,
          and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
          early morning light.

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
          gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
          talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he
          points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME

          CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
          flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad
          lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross
          the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
          from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out
          of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's
          pointing to -- a national weather map.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME

          The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets
          heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
          confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio.

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING

          We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket.
          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
          head in the door.

           HAWLEY
           Christ, what a pit. Phil"
          The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
          It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.

           PHIL

           (SLEEPY)
           What?

           HAWLEY
           It's February first, Phil. You
           know what tomorrow is?
          Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.

           PHIL
           (catching on)
           Oh, no! Not again.
          He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.

           PHIL
           Forget it! I'm not going.

          

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
          WPGH - Pittsburgh.
          Phil ducks into the studio.

          

           -3-

          

          

          INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
          stats up on a chart.

           PHIL
           Get away from me. I'm working.

           HAWLEY
           So what's the outlook? We gonna
           get that blizzard?
          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
          "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title.

           PHIL
           No way. All that moisture coming
           up from the Gulf is going to miss
           us completely and take a dump on
           Harrisburg.

           HAWLEY
           (with authority)
           Good, 'cause you're going up to
           Punxsutawney to cover the
           groundhog story tomorrow morning
           and I want you back here in time
           to do the five.

           PHIL
           Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will
           you! I covered the goddamn
           groundhog last year and the year
           before that.

           HAWLEY
           And you'll do it :next year and
           the year after, too. When I
           worked in San Diego, I covered
           the swallows coming back to
           Capistrano for ten years in a
           row.

           PHIL
           You should've killed the guy who
           made you do that.

           HAWLEY
           I wanted to do it.

           PHIL
           Then you should've killed
           yourself. I don't want to get
           stuck with the groundhog for the
           rest of my life.

          

           -4-

          

           HAWLEY
           It's a cute story. He comes out,
           he looks around, he wrinkles up
           his little nose, he sniffs around
           a little, he sees his shadow, he
           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
           nice. People like it.

           PHIL
           Many people are morons.

           HAWLEY
           Just do it.

           PHIL
           What'11 you give me?
          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.

           HAWLEY
           (to Phil)
           I'll give you Rita.
           (calls her over)
           Rita, could you come here for a
           second? I got a little job for
           you.
          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
          point to realize it.

           PHIL

           (TEASING)
           You can't send Rita out on a
           story like this. She's just a
           cub, a pup, still wet behind the
           ears. Look at her. Her ears are
           sopping wet. This needs a
           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
           big story. People need to know.

           RITA

           (INTRIGUED)
           What's the story?

           HAWLEY
           The Punxsutawney Groundhog
           Festival.

           RITA
           Gil, if it's all right with you
           I ' d rather follow-up on the
           nurses' strike.

          

           -5-

          

           HAWLEY
           You can do the nurses when you
           get back. Just take the squeaky
           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
           get him back in one piece. Okay?

           RITA
           Yeah, okay.
          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
          she finds him appealing in an odd way.

           PHIL

           (PLEASANTLY)
           You know, this could be extremely
           interesting.

           RITA
           I've never done a weather story
           before. What's Punxsutawney
           like?

           PHIL
           Oh, it's an enchanted place. A
           magical world. It's the
           Constantinople of the whole
           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
           Drainage system.

           RITA
           Do you always joke?

           PHIL
           About 70 to 80% of the time.
           Inside I'm actually a very shy
           and sensitive person.

           RITA
           A lot of people around here think
           you're not very sincere.

           PHIL
           Tell me the names of these
           people.

           RITA
           I'll line up a crew and
           transportation. If you don't
           feel like driving, we can all go
           up in the van together.

           PHIL
           I think I'll take my own car.
           I ' m not that fond of my fellow
           man.

          

           -6-

          

          

           RITA

           (EXITING)
           Nice attitude.

           PHIL
           Nice face.
           (calls after her)
           Why don't you ride up with me?

           RITA
           No, thanks.
          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.

          

          INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER

          Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
          himself on the TV monitor.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           They don't really think of me as
           a weatherman around here. More
           of a "personality," but with the
           credibility of a first-class
           broadcast journalist. Once you
           look at my tape I think you'll
           see what they mean.
          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
          scary.

           STEPHANIE

           (BITTERLY)
           I just want to know one thing:
           did I do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what? I
           have to know.
          Phil sighs.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           Dan, can I call you back? I've
           just been handed something and I
           better get on it...
           (he picks up some
           papers and rustles
           them for effect)
           ...Okay, thanks.

          

           -7-

          
          He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
          privacy.

           PHIL

           (KINDLY)
           You didn't do anything wrong,
           Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
           you. It's just that I don't have
           time for a real relationship
           right now. I told you that the
           first time we went out.

           STEPHANIE
           (getting close)
           Everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship.

           PHIL
           (gently pushing her

           AWAY)
           I'm different. I really meant
           it! Things are really starting
           to move for me now. I ' m not
           going to be doing the weather for
           the rest of my life. I was just
           talking to the CBS guy about a
           network job. I want that. This
           is just the beginning for me. I
           can't waste any more time.

           STEPHANIE
           Are you saying our relationship
           was a waste of time?

           PHIL
           Our relationship? We went out a
           total of four times! And only
           twice did anything happen. It
           was fun but I don't see that as
           a big commitment.

           STEPHANIE
           (closing in again)
           I had our charts done. My
           astrologer says we're extremely
           compatible. There may even be
           some past lives involvement here.

           PHIL
           See? So we've already done this.
           Let's move on. Next case.

           STEPHANIE
           You know what's wrong with you,
           Phil? You're selfish. You don't
           have time for anyone but
           yourself.

          

           -8-

          

           PHIL
           That's what I ' m trying to tell
           you. You don't want to be with
           me. You can do better. Look,
           Stephanie, if I ever said or did
           anything to mislead you I'm sorry
           for that, but right now I have to
           do this groundhog thing and I
           don't have a handle on it yet.
          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
          puts on his jacket.

           PHIL (CONT.)
           I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
           do some serious thinking while
           I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
          He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
          standing there with a malevolent look on her face.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

          A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane
          highway through the winter landscape of West Central
          Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
          Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and
          techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus
          coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen
          Like it Wet."

           PHIL (V.O.)
           (on his earphone)
           I'm on my way to Punxsutawney...
           (forced to repeat it,
           a little embarrassed)
           Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun?
           I think that all depends on you.

          

          INT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUS

          Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a
          stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both
          hands.

           PHIL
           . . . . I thought maybe you could
           meet me up there tonight and let
           me vulgarize you for about seven
           hours....So I ' m supposed to spend
           the night in Punxsutawney all
           alo ne? Thanks.

          
          Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in.

          A SIGN
          "Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the
          World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon
          GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his
          arm.
          The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts
          of town.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATER

          The van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are
          cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has
          been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.

          

          EXT . MOTEL - LATER
          The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The
          announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog
          Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The
          parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of
          other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and
          everybody gets out.
          Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.

           PHIL
           (calls out)
           Rita! I can't stay here.
          Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van.

           Prima donnas.

           RITA
           It's okay. I'll handle it.
          She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
          call on his earphone.

           RITA
           What's the problem, Phil?

           PHIL
           I hate this place. I stayed here
           two years ago and I was
           miserable. It's like a minimum
           security prison. I'm not staying
           here.

           No, Larry and I don't care but I
           thought you might, so I booked
           you at a very nice bed and
           breakfast on Cherry Street.
           Here's the address.
          She hands him a card.

           PHIL

           (PLEASED)
           Great. That's great. That's the
           mark of a really good producer.
           Making the talent happy.

           Whatever I can do.

           slave?

           RITA
           Whatever I can do within reason.
           Would you like to have dinner
           with Larry and me?

           PHIL
           No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.
           Why don't you ditch Larry and let
           me take you someplace nice?

           RITA
           You mean like a date?

           PHIL
           Yeah.

           RITA
           Oh, no.

           PHIL
           Okay. I get it. You're a little
           intimidated by me, you're all
           excited about the shoot tomorrow,
           you want everything to go just
           perfect. I understand. You just
           get some sleep. Tomorrow will be
           great.

           morning.
          He drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.

           LARRY

          A digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio
          comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got
          You, Babe."

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed and looks around the room. The decor is
          typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints,
          and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. His suit is
          hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase
          is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed.
          A iradio, DEEJAY and his SIDEKICK come on with hyped-up,
          drivetime Chappy talk." Phil stares at the radio and listens
          to them.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there

           TODAY1
          Phil grimaces and swings out of bed.

           SIDEK ICK
           It's cold out there everyday.
           W hat is this-- Miami Beach?
          The deejay laughs. Phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee
          as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth.

          

           -12-

          

           DEEJAY
           Not hardly. And you can expect
           hazardous travel later today with
           that, you know, blizzard thing--

           SIDEKICK
           That "blizzard thing?"
          Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.

           SIDEKICK (CONT.)
           Oh, here's the report: the
           National Weather Service is
           calling for a big blizzard thing.

           DEEJAY
           Yes they are, but there's another
           reason today is very special--

           SIDEKICK
           Es pec ia lly cold--

           DEEJAY
           Especially cold, okay, but the
           big question on everybody's lips--

           SIDEKICK
           Ch ap pe d lips--

           DEEJAY
           :--on their chapped lips, right--
           Do you think Phil's going to come
           out and see his shadow?

           SIDEKICK
           Punxsutawney Phil.
          Phil looks up at himself in the mirror, admiring his own face.

           DEEJAY
           That's right, rodent lovers!

           IT'S--

           BOTH DEEJAYS

          Phil heads for the breakfast room of the inn, now well-dressed
          in a suit and tie, a nice overcoat slung over his arm. A
          CHUBBY MAN passes.

           CHUBBY MAN

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a
          breakfast buffet. An old spinet piano stands in the corner.
          One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful
          of guests are seated around the room, eating.
          The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she
          comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           (with mock civility)
           Like a Roumanian orphan, Mrs.
           Lancaster.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Would you like some coffee?

           PHIL
           I don't suppose it1 d be possible
           to get an espresso or a capuccino
           around here.

           MRS. LANCASTER

           (BLANKLY)
           I don't really know --

           PHIL
           Forget it. This '11 be fine.

          

           -14-

          

           MRS. LANCASTER
           ( as she pours)
           I wonder what the weather's going
           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           PHIL
           My guess is it'11 be cold and
           overcast, high today in the low
           30's, dropping to the low 20's
           tonight, but I'm predicting that
           all that moisture coming up from
           the Gulf is going to miss us and
           dump some locally heavy snow,
           possibly blizzard conditions with
           travel advisories in the
           Harrisburg area and maybe as far
           east as .Philadelphia.
           (off her surprised

           You want to talk weather, you

          He heads for the door.

           today, Mr. Connors?

          Phil exits.

          EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Sipping at the steaming coffee, Phil manages to put on his coat
          and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and
          joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET -KPUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS

          There are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic
          is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the
          cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making
          the annual trek to see the groundhog.
          An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
          storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without
          taking any notice.

           MAN (O.C.)
           Hey, Phil!

          

           -15-

          

          
          A big pie-faced man, NED RYERSON, comes huffing and puffing
          right up to him. There is something about this guy that makes
          us dislike him on sight.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!
          Phil looks at him vaguely.

           PHIL
           (at a loss)
           I 'm sorry. Have we-- uh--

           NED
           My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
           say you don't remember me, 'cause
           I sure as heckrfire remember you.
           Well?
          Phil stares, trying to remember.

           NED
           Ned Ryerson? Needlenose Ned?
           Ned the Head. Come on, buddy.
           Case Western High?

           brain of yours. Click-click,

           Ned Ryerson, did the whistling
           trick with my belly button in the
           talent show. Bing! Ned Ryerson,
           got the shingles real bad senior
           ^year^ almost didn't graduate.

           PHIL
           So what're you doing with
           yourself, Ned?

           NED
           Phil, I sell insurance.

           No kidding.

           NED
           Do you have life insurance, Phil?
           'Cause if you do, I bet you could
           u s e more-- who couldn't?--but I
           got a feeling you don't have any.
           Am I right?

           PHIL
           You know, Ned, I ' d love to talk
           to you but I really have to--
          Phil starts to walk away,,but Ned won't take the hint.

           NED
           That's okay. I'll walk with you.
           When I see an opportunity, I
           charge it, like a bull. Ned the
           Bull, that's me now. Some of my
           friends live and die by actuarial
           tables, but I think it's all just
           a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard
           of single .premium life? That
           could be the ticket for you,
           buddy. God, it's good to see
           you! Hey, what're you doing for
           dinner?

           PHIL
           Dinner? Umm, I don't think
           that's going to work for me.
          As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
          shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs
          like a donkey.

           NED
           Hey, look out for that first
           step! It's a doozy!
          Phil looks at him with murderous contempt.

          EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - DAWN

          A big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a
          residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of
          dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
          a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
          An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
          cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
          sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.

          

           -17-

          

          
          Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and
          glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.

           RITA
           How could he be late?

           LARRY
           Prima donnas.

           RITA
           It's just so-- inconsiderate.

           LARRY
           What happens to some people?
           They're born nice. They grow up
           nice. You put 'em on TV and -
           bam! Prima donnas.
          Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.

           RITA
           Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.
           Over here!
          Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark
          near the rail fence.

           RITA
           Where've you been?

           PHIL
           I got hung up with some jerk I
           went to high school with. So,
           did you sleep okay without me?
           You tossed and turned, didn't
           you?
          Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.

           RITA
           You're incredible.

           PHIL
           Who told you?

           RITA
           Ready when you are.
          Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
          against the fence.
          The Groundhog Club Officials in top hats, striped trousers and
          cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney
          Phil.

           RITA
           Looks like they're starting.
           Roll tape.

           LARRY
           Rolling.
          Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly
          snaps into announce mode.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           Once a year, the eyes of the
           nation turn here, to this tiny
           hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch
           a master at work. The master?
           Punxsutawney Phil, the world's
           most famous weatherman, the
           groundhog, who, as legend has it,
           can predict the coming of an
           early spring.
          Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
          A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
          ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
          and retreats.

           PHIL
           And here's the big moment we've
           all been waiting for. Let's just
           see what Mr. Groundhog has to
           say.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
          the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
          as far away from the cameras as he can get.

           PHIL
           Hey! Over here, you little
           weasel!
          Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
          a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there
          a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
          squeak and runs back into the hole.

           PHIL
           Great shot, huh, folks? Well,
           that was certainly worth the
           trip. Now we'll be hearing from
           Mr. Buster Greene, President of
           the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
           the so-called Seer of Seers who
           will interpret for us.
          BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat,
          walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.

           B U ST E R
           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.

           PHIL
           (sarcastic, to camera)
           Well, that's it. Sorry you
           couldn't be here in person to
           share the electric moment. This
           is one event where televison
           really fails to capture the
           excitement of thousands of people
           gathered to watch a large
           squirrel predict the weather, and
           I for one am deeply grateful to
           have been a part of it.
           Reporting for Channel 9, this is
           Phil Connors.
          Larry cuts the camera.

           RITA
           (to Phil)
           You want to try one that's a
           little sweeter?

           PHIL
           (to Rita)
           That's as sweet as I get. I'm
           outa here.
          As he exits, Phil tosses the mike to Larry, who isn't expecting
          the throw and bobbles it, dropping the mike on the ground.

          to his table and sits down across from him.

           RITA
           That was really lousy.

           A real professional would have

           God, you really take this stuff
           seriously, don't you.

           RITA
           Yes, I do. As far as I ' m
           concerned there are no little
           stories, Phil. Only little
           reporters with big egos who think
           they're too good for the job they
           have to do.

           PHIL
           (trying to look hurt)
           You really don't know me very
           well, do you. 'Cause if you did
           you could never say something
           like that about me. I care!
           Call me a cockeyed optimist but
           I happen to think there's more to
           this job than just getting my
           ugly mug on the boob tube every
           night.

           RITA
           Is that so.

           PHIL
           Yes, that is so.
          Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
          Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.

           PHIL
           So as far as us getting together,
           would you say the glass is half
           empty or half full?
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just
           starting to fall.

           PHIL(V.O)
           (on the earphone)
           I'll call you after I see the
           network guy. I should be back
           there in a couple of
           hours...What?...1 can't hear you--
           you're breaking up...Hello?
           Sabrina?

          

           INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates.
           The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield
           wipers.

           PHIL
           Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit!
           He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and
           notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the
           traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing
           moves.
           He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a
           parking lot.

           PHIL
           No. No!

          

           EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the
           parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport
           shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin
           up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks
           on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he
           j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY

          "J PATROLMEN.

           PHIL
           What's going on, Officer?

          

           -22-

          

           PATROLMAN
           Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1
           the road. Big accident up ahead.
           Blizzard movin1 in.

           PHIL
           What blizzard? A couple of
           flakes! An isolated phenomenon
           of nature.

           PATROLMAN
           Are you nuts? We got a major
           storm movin' in.

           PHIL
           No, no. All that moisture is
           going to miss us and hit
           Harrisburg.

           PATROLMAN
           Pal, you got that moisture on
           your head.

           PHIL
           But I have to get to Pittsburgh
           today!

           PATROLMAN
           Mister, the only place anybody's
           goin' on this road is back to
           Punxsutawney.
          Phil glowers at him and shivers.

          INT. GAS STATION - LATER

          Phil is on a pay phone. Snow is falling heavily outside.
          GAS STATION ATTENDANT is shovelling around the pumps.

           PHIL
           So all the long distance lines
           a re down? What about the
           sa tellite? Is it snowing in
           space?...But I have to call
           Pittsburgh...Isn't there some
           special line you keep open for
           emergencies or for
           celebrities?...Well, I'm both
           really. I'm a celebrity in an
           emergency. Can you patch me
           through on that line?

          

           -23-

          
          The door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and
          blowing snow. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT enters the tiny office
          and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on
          the head with his snow shovel.

          INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING

          Phil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the
          Pennsylvanian. He looks very bored, drinking a beer,
          unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named NANCY.

           PHIL
           You never saw me on TV-- on the
           news?

           NANCY
           I don't think so. What part of
           the news do you do?

           PHIL
           I ' m the White House correspondent
           for NBC news.

           NANCY
           Oh , I ' m so sure .

           PHIL
           Ask me anything?

           NANCY
           Okay, how big is the White House?

           PHIL
           Three bedrooms, two and a half
           baths. Looks much bigger than it
           , is.
          Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor.
          Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes
          into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS
          flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding
          but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux,
          comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST
          MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away.
          Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to
          Nancy .

           PHIL
           Good start. I ' m sure they'll be
           very happy. So what do you say?
           You want to play doggie obedience
           school with me?

          

           -24-

          

           NANCY
           Thanks. I'll pass.
          She gets up to leave.

           PHIL
           Sit! Stay!
          He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits
          somewhat unsteadily.

          marked page .

          

          INT. CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

          Phil enters his room and drunkenly tosses his overcoat, scarf
          and gloves on the floor in a heap.

          

          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Stephanie Decastro, Phil ' s disaffected ex-lover, is sitting
          cross-legged on the floor with the book of curses open in front
          of her. Her hair is down, she's wearing a caftan with a Zodiac
          print, there are candles everywhere and other vaguely occult
          decorating touches.

          Phil's business card is dropped into a dish. Then the Tarot
          card of the Hanged Man, a chicken bone, and a feather are
          placed on top of it .

          PHIL
          He stands at the sink, looking at himself in the mirror,
          flexing his muscles .

          STEPHANIE
          Reading from the book> she mutters incantations in a secret
          language, then she sprinkles some powder on the plate, then a
          few drops of oil. Then she makes a few passes over it with her
          hands and, much to her surprise, the contents of the plate
          spontaneously combust.

          PHIL

          
          As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the
          suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.

          He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave
          them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking
          u up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then
          he closes his eyes and quickly drops off to sleep, still fully
          clothed.

          STEPHANIE
          To complete the spell, she picks up a broken wristwatch and
          drops it into the fire.

          Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room.
          Something is wrong. He's wearing pajamas, his suit is once
          again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is
          back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed.
          The song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come
          on with the same manic energy. Phil stares at the radio and
          listens to them. A look of astonishment comes over his face as
          they banter.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today!

           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this-- Miami Beach?
          The deejay laughs. Phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same
          time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.

           PHIL
           (to himself)
           Nice going guys. That's
           yesterday's tape.
          Phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only
          half-listening to the radio.

           know, blizzard thing --

           SIDEKICK
           That "blizzard thing?"
          Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if
          trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition
          of the broadcast.

           SIDEKICK (CONT.)
           Oh, here's the report: the
           National Weather Service is
           calling for a big blizzard
           thing."

           DEEJAY
           Yes they are, but there's another
           reason today is very special --

           SIDEKICK
           Especially cold --

           DEEJAY
           Especially cold, okay, but the
           big question on everybody's lips --
          Phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio.

           SIDEKICK AND PHIL
           Chapped lips --

           DEEJAY
           -- on their chapped lips, right --

           out and see his shadow?

           SIDEKICK
           Punxsutawney Phil.
          Some vague doubt causes Phil to go to the window.

          suit jacket and overcoat over his arm. As he heads for the
          breakfast room, the same Chubby Man passes.

           CHUBBY MAN

          Phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into
          his eyes.

           PHIL
           Don't mess with me, pork chop.
           What day is this?

           CHUBBY MAN

           (TERRIFIED)
           Febr uary second--Groundhog Day!
          Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the
          poor man.

           PHIL
           Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad
           day.
          Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.

          Phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything
          exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as
          she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           (completely confused)
           D i d I? I don't know--

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Would you like some coffee?

           PHIL
           Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a
           little strange.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           ( as she pours)
           I wonder what the weather's going
           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           PHIL
           Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs.
           Lancaster?

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Is that the Italian dessert with
           the brandy and the chocolate
           mousse?

           PHIL
           No, that's spaghetti. Never
           mind.
          He heads for the door, still in a daze.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Oh, will you be checking out
           today, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL

           (VAGUELY)
           I don't know. I don't think so.

          Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up
          from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps
          of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY.

           PHIL
           Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's
           everybody going?

           PASSERBY
           To Gobbler's Knob. It's
           Groundhog Day!
          The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open-
          mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if
          trying to clear it and starts off down the street.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD
          BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.

           NED RYERSON (O.C.)
           Hey, Phil!
          Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!
          Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.

           NED
           My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
           say you don't remember me, 'cause
           I sure as heck-fire remember you.
           Well?

           buddy?

           PHIL
           To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m
           not feeling real well. Could you
           excuse me?

           NED
           Now it's funny you should mention
           your health 'cause you'll never
           guess what I do.

           Do you sell insurance, Ned?

           NED
           Bing again! You're sharp as a
           tack today. Do you have life
           insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you
           do, I bet you could use more --
           who couldn't?" -- but I got a
           feeling you don't have any. Am
           I right?

           PHIL
           (really annoyed now)
           Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I
           can't talk to you right now.
          He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep,
          slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.

           NED

           step. It's a doozyi

          when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.

           RITA
           Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil!
           Over here!
          Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of
          the Knob, gesturing for her to follow.
          Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward
          Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in
          the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is
          uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
          mussed.

           PHIL
           (nervous, sweat ing)
           I've got to talk to you. I think
           I'm losing my mind.

           . RITA
           I know you're losing it. What
           are you doing over here? The
           camera's over there.

           PHIL
           Slap me, Rita.

           RITA
           What is this?

           PHIL

           (INSISTENT)
           Just slap me-- hard.
          She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.

           PHIL
           I said hardl

          . . .. ... .RITA .
           I can't!

           PHIL
           Do it!
          Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.

           PHIL
           (his cheek smarting)
           Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

           RITA
           Are you drunk?

           PHIL
           No, drunk is more fun. Can I be
           serious with you for a minute?

           RITA
           I don't know. Can you?

           PHIL
           Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m
           having a problem-- no, I may be
           having a problem.

           RITA
           What are you trying to say?

          

           -32-

          

           PHIL
           I'm trying to say that if I was
           having a problem, just
           hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know
           that you're someone I could count
           on in a crisis.

           RITA

           (WORRIED)
           What did you do last night?
          The crowd begins to hush.

           LARRY
           We better get started. We're
           going to miss it.

           PHIL
           Were not going to miss it.
           (indicating the other

           REPORTERS)
           They're going to miss it.

           RITA

           (EMPHATIC)
           Phil. We've been out here for an
           hour. We're cold and tired.
           Let's just get this and get out
           of here.

           PHIL
           Okay, put it here.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Put the camera here .
          Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all
          of the other cameras are set up .

           RITA
           Phil , there is no tomorrow on
           this one. It's Groundhog Day.

           PHIL
           We were in the wrong spot
           yesterday .

           RITA

           (IRKED)
           W ha t? Yesterday? What are you
           talking about?

           PHIL
           Just trust me. Put the camera
           here .

          

           -33-

          

          
          Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and
          gives up.

           RITA
           Larry!
          She charges off toward the cameras.
          In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to
          their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any
          second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to
          Phil.
          Larry hurriedly sets up the camera.

           LARRY
           You want me to roll tape?

           RITA
           (to Phil)
           Are you going to get on your
           mark?

           PHIL
           No hurry.
          Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to
          their cameras and pointing towards the mound.

           LARRY

           (DESPERATELY)
           Everyone else is rolling!
          Rita looks helplessly at Phil.

           RITA
           I'm begging you, all right?
           Gould we please just do this?
          Phil glances down at his watch.

           PHIL
           Okay, let's do it.
          He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder.

           PHIL
           Roll tape.

           LARRY

           (MUMBLING)
           Prima donnas.
          Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
          against the fence.

           LARRY
           Rolling.

          

           -34-

          
          Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this
          time it's a bit tentative.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again--
           and you know what that means.
           Everybody's here on Gobbler's
           Knob waiting in the cold for the
           appearance of the most famous
           groundhog in the world,
           Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to
           tell us just how much more of
           this we can expect.
          The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door,
          then opens it and retreats.
          Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
          prediction, recalling the previous day.

           PHIL
           My forecast is we're going to see
           the groundhog peek its head out
           of its hole, look around a little
           bit, then he's going to come out,
           scamper over to this general
           area, look at the crowd for a
           second, make a little burping
           noise and run back into the
           ground.

           RITA
           (whispers to Larry)
           That's it. I'm going to kill
           him.
          Phil looks at his watch.

           PHIL
           O k ay ? And here we go--
          Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
          steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
          directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
          Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
          burrow.

          

           -35-

          

           RITA

           (HISSES)
           Phil!
          Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the
          mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.

           BUSTER
           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in
          disappointment.
          Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in
          a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.

           RITA
           (at a loss)
           For Channel 9 News, this is Rita
           Hanson in Punxsutawney.
          She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her
          finger across her throat.

           - LATER

          INT; PHIL'S ROOM
          Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           I know there's a blizzard, but I
           have to get a call through to my
           doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a
           medical emergency. . . .No, don't
           give me the Punxsutawney Fire
           Department. When do you think
           the long distance lines will be
           working again?. . . But what if we
           don't have a tomorrow? We didn't
           have one today, my friend...
           Hello...Hello?
          He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to
          ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls
          the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes
          a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the
          pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and
          retreats back under the covers.

           CUT TO:

          

           -36-

          CLOSE UP - CLOCK
          The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The
          radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I
          Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the
          nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by
          the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing
          hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today!

           SIDEKICK
           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this-- Miami Beach?
          Phil rushes out of the room.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. CHERRY STREET - LATER

          Phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon
          buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware
          store.

          

          INT. BED AND BREAKFAST - CONTINUOUS

          Phil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Painting something, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           I ' m conducting an experiment.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - LATER

          Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed. Out fall a couple
          of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a
          crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools. He puts on
          the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing
          the door shut.

           CUT TO:

          

           -37-

          

          EXT. CORRIDOR - LATER

          Mrs. Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the
          hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking
          very worried. Loud music is playing inside the room.
          From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering,
          wood splintering and glass breaking.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
          in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
          the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
          sink.
          Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
          to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer.
          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it.
          As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers.
          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
          We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
          the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
          and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
          sleeping on the bed.
          He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
          paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in.
          He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
          hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
          The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word
          right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
          wonderment.

          

           -38-

          

           PHIL AND DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today.

           PHIL AND SIDEKICK
           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this -- Miami Beach?
          The deejay laughs. Phil laughs insanely along with him.

          EXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - EARLY MORNING
          Phil is wrapping up another groundhog report, trying to be
          completely professional despite the circumstances.

           PHIL
           (with forced good

           HUMOR)
           . . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog
           I guess we can expect six more
           weeks of winter. It's not very
           scientific, but it sure is fun.
           Hey, wait a second. If he's
           right, I could be out of a job!
           (mock laugh)
           For Channel 9 News, this is Phil
           Connors in Punxsutawney .
          He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.

           PHIL
           How was that?

           RITA

           (PLEASED)
           It was good. A little smarmy for
           my taste, but I guess that's what
           sells.

           PHIL
           Could I talk to you about a
           matter that is not work related?

           RITA
           You never talk about work.

           PHIL
           Do you know what I did last
           night?

           RITA

           I destroyed my hotel room.

           RITA
           You whatl This is not some kind
           of rock and roll tour. We don't
           have the budget for that--

           PHIL
           No, it's okay. This morning it
           was all right again. That's what
           I have to talk to you about.

          Phil and Rita cross the street and walk past a crowd of
          concerned citizens gathered around what looks like a car
          accident. As an ambulance arrives, Phil and Rita enter the
          cozy looking diner on the corner.

          

          INT. DINER.- CONTINUOUS

          Phil and Rita sit together at the same table they had
          previously. The WAITER approaches.

           RITA
           (to waiter)
           Could I have some coffee, please?
          The waiter pours her a cup.

           RITA
           Thanks.
           (to Phil)
           Okay, so tell me. How'd you know
           where to put the camera?

           PHIL
           Because I've done it before.

           RITA
           I know, but the groundhog doesn't
           do exactly the same thing every
           year, does he?

          

           -40-

          

           PHIL
           I ' m not talking about last year.
           I ' m talking about today. I lived
           it before.

           You're having deja vu?

           PHIL
           Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts
           but I keep reliving the same day
           o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day--
           today. This is the third time.

           RITA
           (completely skeptical)
           Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the
           punchline.

           PHIL
           No, really. It's like today
           never happened. I shaved my head
           last night, today its all grown
           back. I could probably cut off
           my limbs, one by one, and - pop!
           They'd grow back. Just like a
           starfish. I probably don't even
           have to floss?

           RITA
           I'm wracking my brain, but I
           can't even begin to imagine why
           you'd make up something like
           this.

           PHIL
           'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm
           asking for your help.
          Rita looks at him for a long moment.

           RITA
           Okay, I'll bite. What do you

          down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking.

           PHIL
           I'm waiting.

           NANCY
           .Mrs. Walsh.

           PHIL
           Walsh. Nancy, Lincoln, Walsh.

           NANCY
           Is this some kind of come-on?

           PHIL
           I'm not really sure. We'll have
           to see.
          Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position.

          INT. DINER - LATER THAT MORNING

          Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an
          incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage,
          pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc.
          Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs
          himself with pastry.

           RITA
           Is this some new fad diet? Don't
           you worry about cholesterol?
          Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
          eclair.

          

           -52-

          

           PHIL
           I don't worry about anything
           anymore.

           RITA
           What makes you so special?
           Everybody worries about
           something.

           PHIL
           That's exactly what makes me so
           special.
          He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.

           PHIL
           (with his mouth full)
           What?

           RITA
           "The wretch, concentered all
           in self,
           Living, shall forfeit fair
           renown,
           And doubly dying, shall go
           down to the vile dust from
           whence he sprung,
           Unwept, unhonored, and
           unsung." Sir Walter Scott.

           Na n t uc k e t-- "

           RITA
           That's really funny. When are
           you going to grow up, Phil?

           PHIL
           At this rate-- never.
           (he pulls out a pack of

           CIGARETTES)
           Okay if I smoke?
          Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.

           RITA
           You really do have a death wish,
           don't you?

           PHIL
           Just the opposite, Rita. I have
           a life wish. I'm just trying to
           enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the
           little things. Don't you ever
           just want to cut loose and go
           wild?

          

           -53-

          

           RITA
           I wouldn't even know what it
           means to go wild.

           PHIL
           Yeah, well, that's where I come
           in. Going wild is one of my
           specialties. Last night I got
           completely loaded and drove head-
           on into a police car.

           RITA

           (DISBELIEVING)
           Oh, really? You look pretty good
           this morning.

           PHIL
           That's my point. I know you
           won't believe me, but we could do
           anything we want today and it
           wouldn't matter one bit.
           Absolutely no consequences.
           Complete and total freedom.

           RITA
           And how. . , do we manage that?

           PHIL
           You leave that to me. Why don't
           you send Larry back and hang out
           with me for the rest of the day?
           You never make it through that
           blizzard anyway.
          Larry enters the diner and spots them.

           RITA
           I'll take my chances with the
           -weather. But you have a good
           time.

          Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot
          she was in the day before.

           PHIL
           Nancy?
          Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically.

           (MOANS)
           Oh, Phil.

           PHIL
           Oh , Rita .
          The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then
          she snaps on the light. It's Nancy, not Rita. Phil is as
          surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.

           NANCY

           (COLD)
           Who's Rita?

           PHIL

           (CAUGHT)
           No one. It's just something I
           say when I make love. You know --
           "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like
           "Oh, baby" or something.

           NANCY
           (not entirely

           CONVINCED)
           Oh.

           PHIL
           (corrects her)
           O-rita.

          Some elderly GUESTS are sipping coffee and eating breakfast,
          staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the
          room.

          THEIR POV
          Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas,
          absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the
          books.
          Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Isn't it a wonderful collection?

           PHIL
           (not looking up)
           Yes, it is. You don't usually
           find this many trashy novels in
           one place.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           You can take a book up to your
           room if you like.

           PHIL
           No, thank you. I've actually
           read them all. I was just
           rereading some of the dirty
           parts.
          He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf.

           MRS. LANCASTER

           (WORRIED)
           How long will you be staying with
           us, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           Indefinitely. I've already been
           here for 211 days.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           (humoring him)
           Really? That's quite a long
           time, isn't it. I hope you're
           finding things to do in our
           little town.

           PHIL

           (CASUALLY)
           Yes, well, I'm getting a little
           tired of casual sex so today I
           thought I'd rob a bank and buy
           myself a really expensive car.

          Two harmless-looking old GUARDS are calmly loading bags of cash
          into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. Suddenly
          Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape,
          his face completely hidden by a ski mask.

           PHIL

           All right, freeze!! Drop your
           guns J!

           Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil.
          He raises the mask and shows his face.

          A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver
          spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil
          emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit
          with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl,
          LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French
          maid.

          white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut
          named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA
          WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on
          to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of

          is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and
          women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off
          whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door,
          shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes
          against the door.
          Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm
          around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand.

           to Angie)
           Yeah, but eventually you' d just
           get tired of screwing around and

           It's tough to find a relationship
           like that, especially if your

          right with her.

           PHIL
           No, I just want to know you

           going to make me feel like a
           fool?

           I'm just trying to talk to you
           like a normal person. Isn't this
           how normal people talk?

           Close.

           RITA
           I guess I want what everybody
           wants-- you know, career, love,
           marriage, children. So far I
           don't have any of it.

           PHIL
           You have a career.

           RITA
           I have a job. Doing stories on
           the Punxsutawney groundhog is not
           my ultimate goal. No offense.

           PHIL
           How about the other stuff? You
           seeing anybody?

           RITA
           This is getting too personal. I
           don't think I ' m ready to discuss
           these things with you. What
           about you? What do you want?

           PHIL
           What I really want is someone
           like you.

           RITA
           O h , please--

           PHIL
           Why not?

           RITA
           Phil, you know, you have so much
           talent and ability. If you'd
           just drop the attitude and act
           like a decent human being, then
           maybe I ' d --

           I don't know what.

           PHIL
           Then maybe you'd like me?
          She stares hard at him.

           RITA
           I don't know. It's sort of like
           the way I feel about UFO's. I'd
           have to see it to believe it.

           Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry.
          Larry scowls at Phil and exits.

           Why don't you stay for a while?
           The road's going to be closed
           anyway. Do you really want to be
           stuck in the van with Larry for

           PHIL
           I like small towns. I think they
           engender real community more than
           big cities.

           That is so true! I've always
           thought that, too.

          There is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a
          little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old
          fashioned, wholesome.
          A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to
          see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The
          kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing
          snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little
          gang of friends.
          A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a
          snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no
          together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a
          long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up.

           day like this, but it couldn't
           have been more perfect.

           You're wrong. I've been planning
           this day for weeks.
           Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her

           What's wrong with you!
          There is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old
          doubts about Phil come rushing back.

           RITA
           (shaking her head)
           Oh, no. I can't believe I fell
           for it. This whole day was just
           one long set-up. And I ate
           fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.

           PHIL
           No, it was real. I love you.

          Phil can't manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again.

           PHIL
           No, I guess not. I thought you
           were someone else.
          Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the
          camera. Rita comes over to him.

           RITA
           Are you all right, Phil? You
           look terrible.
          Phil looks at her sadly, then turns away.

          Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and
          dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is
          present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman,
          reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and
          sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads:
          "Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates"
          Phil heads right for it.
          The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
          habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger.
          As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his
          overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip.
          The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes.
          Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the
          case.

          PHIL'S POV
          The groundhog looks right into his sights.
          Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT.
          The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The
          groundhog looks up playfully.
          Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil
          can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the
          rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from
          behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and
          wrestle him to floor.
          The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.

          madness.
          Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his

          realizes he's back in his room at the bed and breakfast.

           PHIL
           Ah, nuts!
          Phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed.

          Ned and a client are huddled over his desk, looking at some
          papers. A BODY DROPS quickly past the window behind them.
          It's Phil.
          They rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three
          stories below. Phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet,
          lifeless.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          "I Got You, Babe" is playing. Phil wakes up and smashes the

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Rita and Larry are walking down the street when a GREYHOUND BUS
          pulls out of the bus station and accelerates down Main Street.
          Suddenly, Phil, dressed in pajamas and overcoat, leaps out in
          front of the speeding bus. Rita witnesses the whole incident.

          D RIVERS' POV
          He sees Phil through the windshield but doesn't even have time
          to hit the brakes before he runs right over Phil.

          Mrs. Lancaster is watching TV in the parlor of the hotel. In
          the corridor behind her, Phil walks by, dressed in a robe,
          carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the
          bathroom.
          A few moments pass.
          We hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and TV flicker
          and dim for a moment, then come back on again.

          Suddenly, the doors burst open and Phil comes running out of
          the bank screaming, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to
          the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand, an Uzi in the
          other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt. He doesn't
          get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of
          gunfire.
          Rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while Larry
          records the grisly massacre.

          Rita stands by weeping while Phil's body is covered with a

          In the shadowy darkness under the sheet, a CLICK is heard and
          Phil's eyes pop open. "I Got You, Babe" plays.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           I ' m sorry. What was that again?

           PHIL
           I'm a god.

           RITA
           You're God?

           PHIL
           No, I'm A god. Not THE God-- at
           least I don't think I am.

           RITA
           That's reassuring. For a mintute
           there I thought you might be
           crazy.

           PHIL
           No, it's true. It's the only
           possible explanation. I'm a
           supernatural being.

           RITA
           Because you survived a car wreck?

          The waiter comes to the table.

           WAITER
           Are you ready to order?

           PHIL
           (to Rita, ignoring the

           WAITER)
           Not just the car wreck! I didn't
           just blow up yesterday, you know.
           I've been run over, drowned,
           crushed, stabbed, shot,
           electrocuted, poisoned, frozen,
           burn ed, and asphyxiated--

           RITA
           Really?
          The waiter looks at him like he's nuts.

           PHIL
           --but I always wake up the next
           day without a scratch, without
           even a headache. I'm telling

           WAITER
           The special today is blueberry
           waffles.

           RITA
           Why are you telling me this?

           WAITER

           (SHRUGS)
           Because some people like
           blueberry waffles.

           No t you-- him.

           PHIL
           Because I want you to believe in
           me.

           RITA
           You're not a god, Phil. Take my
           word for it. This is twelve
           years of Catholic school talking.

           WAITER
           I could come back if you're not
           ready.

           PHIL

           RITA

           PHIL
           How do you know?

           RITA
           Because it's not possible.

           WAITER
           I'll come back.
          The /waiter turns to leave.

           PHIL
           Hey, Billy!
          The waiter turns back.

           PHIL
           This is Bill. He's been a waiter
           for three years because he left
           Penn State and had to find work.
           He likes the town, he paints toy
           soldiers, and he's gay.

          Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next
          table.

           RITA
           What are you doing?

           PHIL
           This is Doris Kleiser and her
           fiance Fred.

           DORIS
           Do I know you?

           PHIL
           They're supposed to get married
           tonight but Doris is having
           second thoughts.

           FRED
           What!
          Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. Rita is a
          little embarrassed.

           RITA
           Lovely ring.

           Thanks.

          Phil drags Rita to the counter.

           PHIL
           This is Ralph. Say "Hi," Rita.
          Rita flashes a quick smile.

           RALPH

           PHIL
           Ralph hates his life here and
           wants to drive around town
           smashing into policemen.

           RALPH
           Well, who don't?

           RITA
           This is some kind of trick.

           PHIL
           Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the
           real God cheats, too. Maybe God
           isn't omnipotent-- he's just had
           a lot of practice.

           RITA
           How about that guy?

           PHIL
           Tom. Worked in the coal mine
           ·til they shut it down.

           Nancy. Went to Lincoln High
           School in Pittsburgh. Takes
           herself out to lunch once a week.
          Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can
          see that Phil is right about each and every one of them.

           RITA
           How do you know these people!

           PHIL
           I told you the truth. In five
           seconds there's going to be a
           grease fire in the kitchen.
           Five, four--

           RITA
           This is nuts.

           PHIL
           --three, two, one.
          Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the
          service window. Everyone in the diner is now staring at them

           RITA
           (trying to puzzle it

           OUT)
           Okay, enough. Let's just sit
           down and think for a second.
           (they sit)
           What do you know about me, Phil?
           Do you know me, too?
          Phil takes a long pause.

           PHIL
           I know all about you, Rita. I
           know you like producing, but hope
           for better than Channel 9,
           Pittsburgh.

           RITA
           Everyone knows that.

           PHIL
           You like boats but not the ocean.
           There's a lake you go to in the
           summer with your family, up in
           the mountains, with an old wooden
           dock and a boathouse with boards
           missing in the roof, and a place
           you used to crawl underneath to
           be alone, and at night you'd look
           up and see the stars. You're a
           sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon
           Brando, and French poetry.
           You're wonderfully generous;
           you're kind to strangers, and
           children; and when you stand in
           the snow, you look like an angel.

          

           RITA
           How are you doing this?

           PHIL
           I told you! I wake up every day
           right here, right in
           Punxsutawney, and it's always
           February second and I can't turn
           it off. If you still don't

           PHIL
           Listen! In ten seconds Larry is
           going to walk through that door
           and take you away from me.

           RITA
           Larry?

           PHIL
           But you can't let him. Please
           believe me. You've got to
           believe me.

           RITA
           I don't --
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
          Rita.

           PHIL
           Look.
          As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad
          from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as
          Larry makes his way to their table. Phil finishes writing.

           LARRY
           (to Rita)
           You ready? We better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.
          Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads it.

           RITA

           (READING)
           " . . . stay ahead of the weather. "
          Larry looks at the paper.

           Afer I got over the shock, it was
           kind of fun for the first year or

          Phil abruptly pulls Rita aside. A big pile of snow slides off
          a roof and onto the sidewalk where they would have walked.
          Phil doesn't even look up. Rita looks, as if she's seeing a
          miracle.

           How did this start?

           could stay conscious I could
           figure out what was going on, or
           at least hang onto something from
           the day before. But I gave up on
           that a long time ago.

          Rita comes to a decision.

           RITA
           Maybe I should spend the rest of
           the day with you-- as an
           objective witness. Just to see

           MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My
           favorite .

           PHIL
           Of course. I told you, I know
           everything .

           I don ' t think I ' d want to know
           everything that ' s going to
           happen. I like to be surprised.

           PHIL
           That's not the worst part.

           RITA
           What's the worst part?

           PHIL
           The worst part is starting over
           everyday. Tomorrow you won't
           remember any of this. You'll go
           back to treating me like a
           complete jerk --

           RITA
           No --

           PHIL
           It's not your fault. I am a
           jerk.

           RITA
           No, you're not.

           PHIL
           Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't
           make a lot of difference. I've
           killed myself so many times, I
           don't even exist anymore. I'm
           just completely empty.

           RITA
           Or completely clean.

           PHIL
           If you're going to be this
           positive all the time I may have
           to rough you up a little.

           RITA
           Wait! Have we done this before?

           PHIL
           Which part?

           RITA
           You getting me up here, the card
           gam e, the pizza--

           PHIL
           No, this is the first time.

           RITA

           (EXCITED)
           Well?

           PHIL
           Well, what?

           RITA
           Well how does it feel to be doing
           something completely new?
          Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.

           PHIL
           Good. Really good.
          He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto.

          Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not
          touching. Soft music is playing on the radio.

           RITA
           Sometimes I wish I had a thousand
           lifetimes. One to be a great
           journalist. One to, I don't
           know, go back to school, study
           art, or auto mechanics. One just
           to take care of all the busywork,
           you know, pay the bills, get my
           car tuned up. One to be the wild
           woman of Borneo. One to be
           Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not
           a curse, Phil. It all just
           depends on how you look at it.
          Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. Then
          he belches really loud. Rita stares at him, then burps
          surprisingly loud herself.

           RITA
           I want you to know, it's been a
           really nice day for me.

           PHIL
           Me, too.

           RITA
           Maybe, if it's not too boring for
           you, we could do it again.

           PHIL
           I hope so.
          The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs Phil's hand. He puts his
          arm around her.
          They look into each others' eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring
          smile. She squeezes his hand. Their eyes turn to the clock.
          11:;59 turns to 12:00.
          Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event.

           RITA
           You're still here!

           PHIL
           I know.

           RITA
           I thought you were supposed to
           disappear-- or I was or
           something.

           PHIL
           Not 'til six.

          She is mad in a playful way.

           PHIL
           I never said midnight--

           RITA
           You knew I was waiting for
           midnight!

           PHIL
           But I never said it.

           RITA
           Oh, I can't believe you!
           (she slugs him with a

           PILLOW)
           I didn't know this was going to
           take all night!

           PHIL
           Does that mean you're going?

           RITA
           No.
          Phil takes Rita's hand. She doesn't resist.

           DISSOLVE TO:

          LATER
          Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head
          resting on his shoulder. She nods off then catches herself.

           RITA
           I'm sorry.

           PHIL
           It's okay to go to sleep you
           know. I promise I won't touch
           you-- much.

           RITA
           No, it's all right. I'm not
           tired. What were you saying?
          Her eyes start to close again.

           PHIL
           I was saying that the cow was
           eventually returned to it's
           rightful owner.

           RITA

           Really?

           PHIL
           That's right.
          He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers
          her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he
          carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to
          her.

           PHIL
           What I was going to say was, I
           think you're the kindest,
           sweetest, prettiest, most
           wonderful girl I ever met in my
           life.
          She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.

           PHIL
           Shhhh. That's good.
           (satisfied she's still

           ASLEEP)
           I could never tell you this, but
           from the first minute I looked at
           you I wanted to just hold you
           close and be with you forever.
           iEverytime I -saw you around the
           station, I thought my heart was
           going to explode. I used to
           dream about us being together.
           In my dream you loved me as much
           as I loved you and we didn't have
           to say anything but I knew you
           understood everything.
          She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
          sleep.

           PHIL
           I know a guy like me could never
           deserve to have someone like you,
           but if I did, I swear I would
           love you for the rest of my life.
          Rita opens her eyes.

           RITA

           (HALF-ASLEEP)
           Did you say something?

           PHIL
           Good-night, Rita.
          He kisses her gently on the forehead.

           RITA
           Good-night, Phil.

           Rita?
          She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the
          night before.

           RITA
           Oh, hi, Phil.

           PHIL
           Thought you might like some--
          He hands her the coffee.

           Thanks!

           Yeah, great.

           RITA
           We're just setting up.

           PHIL
           You know, I bumped into Buster
           Greene, he kind of runs this
           thing, and he tipped me off that
           we might get a better shot over
           there.

          She reaches for an equipment case.

           PHIL
           I'll get that.
          Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear.

          Mary hesitates only a moment, then ushers Phil into the house

           PHIL
           In fact, the groundhog's
           legendary ability to predict the
           weather may be more than just the
           German folklore of the region.
           Higher temperatures trigger
           hormonal changes in the
           testosterone levels of male
           groundhogs, which may in fact
           wake them from hibernation and
           send them out to battle with
           other males ;for mating rights.
           So, the truth is they're not
           looking for their shadows,
           they're looking for groundhog
           chicks.

           Groundhog Day, February second,
           also known as Candlemas Day or
           the Feast of the Purification of
           the Virgin Mary, the day Mary
           first came to the temple for
           ritual blessings following the
           birth of the infant Jesus, and
           celebrated since the Middle Ages
           by the sacramental lighting of
           candles. Hence the old Scottish
           couplet which long predates the
           .American groundhog tradition: "If
           Candlemas dawns bright and clear,
           there'll be two winters in the

          Phil is walking down the street. He glances down the alley as
          he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley. The OLD BUM
          that Phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against
          a wall. Phil goes to help him.

           PHIL
           Hey, mister. Hey. Come on,
           let's get you somewhere warm.
          The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes.

           PHIL
           (helps the old man to
           his feet)
           There you go.
          Phil practically carries him out of the alley.

           NURSE

          Phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors
          leading to triage.

           ...When Chekhov saw the long
           winter, it was a winter bleak and
           dark and bereft of hope; and yet,

          at his watch. Rita follows him at a distance, hurrying to keep
          up.
          MARIE, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection
          shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat. She isn't
          paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck
          bearing down on her.
          As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second
          timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her
          back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly
          missing her.

           PHIL
           Hey! Did you forget to look both
           ways? You didn't even look one
           way.

          purposefully around the tables, squeezing past busy waitresses
          and seated patrons toward a commotion in the back of the
          restaurant.
          TWO BUSINESSMEN are leaning over a THIRD.

          behind, gets him in the Heimlich grip and squeezes sharply.
          A bolus of food flies across the room. The victim coughs and
          sputters, then starts breathing again.

           SECOND BUSINESSMAN
           I think that did it.

           That's pretty amazing. "

          

           -115-

          

           PHIL
           You want to know what's really
           amazing? I've been waiting for
           you every day for ten thousand
           years. I dream of you every
           night of my life. You've been my
           constant weapon against total
           despair, and just knowing you
           exist has kept me alive. How's
           that?
          Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing
          anybody has ever said to anybody.
          Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.

           MARY
           Phil!
           (to her friend)
           This is the guy.

           PHIL
           Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one
           of Punxsey's finest musicians.

           ·MARY
           Give me a break. You should
           talk. Why don't you play
           something?

           PHIL
           N o , I--

           MARY
           Please.

           FRED
           Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it.
          Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
          Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins
          to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls
          silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.
          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil
          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up
          a storm.

           LEO
           That's a great guy you've got
           there. Doctor Connors fixed my
           back, you know.

          

           - -116-

          

          

           RITA
           Do ctor Connors?

          
          Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano.

          

           CUT TO:

          

          

          EXT . STREET - NIGHT

          
          It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm
          in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.
          She looks like an angel.

          

           PHIL
           Wait! Don't move!

          
          Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.

          

           RITA
           Making a snow man? I'll help.

          

           PHIL
           No, stay there. Stand right
           th ere.

          
          Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
          a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          LATER

          
          Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
          a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look
          o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.

          

           RITA
           Can I look?

          

           PHIL
           O kay, look.

          
          It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as
          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

          

           RITA

           (OVERWHELMED)
           Nobody's ever done this for me.
           Not even a drawing. It's
           beautiful.

          

           -117-

          

           PHIL
           This is how I see you. When it
           all gets too much, I just close
           my eyes and there you are-- just
           like this. Take it home and keep
           it in the freezer.
          Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
          each others eyes.

           PHIL
           This one's for the Frog Prince.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Nothing.
          They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.

           PHIL
           Will you come with me?
          Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
          each other in the cold night air.

           RITA
           (looks back at the ice

           SCULPTURE)
           We're just going to leave her?

           PHIL
           It doesn't matter. Really, it
           doesn't.
          They kiss again.

           CUT TO:

          CLOSE UP - THE CLOCK
          The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence.
          No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing.
          Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are
          different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed
          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep
          under the covers.

           PHIL

           (DISBELIEVING)
           It's not true. It's not. It
           can't be true. Rita? Rita!

          

           -118-

          

           RITA

           (STRETCHING

           LUXURIOUSLY)
           Mmmm. Morning.
          Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.

           PHIL
           You're here! My god! I can't
           believe you're here!

           RITA
           Glad to see you, too.

           PHIL
           No! It's happened. Don't you
           get it? It's tomorrow! It's --
          Phil turns on the radio.

           DEEJAY
           . . . still shoveling put the
           highways, but if you're walking,
           it's a beautiful day.

           S IDEKICK
           Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned
           e ve r yt h in g up--

           DEEJAY
           --except your mouth.
          Phil kisses the radio.

           PHIL
           I love those guys.

           RITA
           Are you always this jolly in the
           morning?
          Phil runs to the window and looks out.

          HIS POV - THE STREET
          The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids
          are throwing snowballs.

           PHIL
           No groundhog! Rita! They're all
           gone!

           RITA
           You must've had some dream.
          Phil stops, thinks.

          

           -1 1 9 -

          

           PHIL
           Did I just dream it?
          Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
          pajama bottoms.

           RITA
           Phi l? Phil!
          Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else
          in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly
          playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
          bars.

           PHIL (O.C.)
           Yeah!!!!
          Phil runs back into the room.

           PHIL
           It really happened! You're
           really here!
          He pounces on Rita again.

           PHIL
           You're really actually here.

           RITA

           (LAUGHING)
           I'm here, I'm here!
          They kiss, passionately, hungrily.

           PHIL
           Let's go!
          He scoops her up in his arms.

           RITA
           Where're we going?

           PHIL
           Anywhere! Everywhere!

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LATER

          Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster
          Phil hugs her.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Oh, my!

          

           -120-

          

           PHIL
           Florence! Say hello to Rita.
           She loves me.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           I'm not surprised.
          He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.

          

          EXT. THE STREET - DAY

          Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.

           A MAN
           Phil! Good morning!

           A LADY
           Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank
           you.

           PHIL
           That's all right. I--
          A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.

           FLORIST
           Phil, here. I want you to have
           these.

           PHIL
           Thanks, Carl.
          Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.

           PHIL (V.O.)
           And so began my final lifetime,
           and ended the longest winter on
           record. I would find myself no
           longer able to affect the chain
           of events in this town, but I did
           learn something about time. You
           can waste time, you can kill
           time, you can do time, but if you
           use it wisely, there's never
           enough of it. So you'd better
           make the most of the time you've
           got.
          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita
          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita
          and Phil continue their walk.

          

           -121-

          

           PHIL (V.O.)
           Larry never got through the
           blizzard, so none of my groundhog
           reports ever made it on the air.
           But Rita and I-- we lived happily
           ever after.
          Phil and Rita walk off together.
          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.

           NED
           But Phil told me you were his
           accountant!

           LARRY
           Look, I told you! He's nuts!
          Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.

           NED
           Let me just tell you about single
           premium life--
          Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned
          floundering in a snowbank.
          Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
          revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
          that embraces it.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by
          a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
          CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT

          PURSUIT.

          INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of
          two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,
          has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,
          despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out
          of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.

                         RICK
          Pull over, man!

                         FRED
          No way, I can out-run 'em!

                         RICK
          No you can't--not in this thing!
          Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and

          JOINS THE CHASE.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Oh God, now there's two of 'em!

                         FRED
          I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til
          we get there!

                         RICK
          Are you crazy?!

                         FRED
          Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my
          wife!

          ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
          followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see
          that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
          of the mini-van.
          Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS
          spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach
          the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.
          Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.

                         RICK

          INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          ON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early-
          20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK
          hams it up for the camera.

          RICK (O.S.)
          See the stud in the blue shorts?
          That's me the summer I got out of
          college.

          LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on
          either side of Rick.

                         RICK
          I still have a few.

                         GUNNAR
          Where?
          Rick shoots him a look.

                         RICK
          They're hidden.
          BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes
          up and puts her arms around Rick.

                         EMMA
          Who's that girl?

                         RICK
          That's Mommy.

                         EMMA
          No, I mean the young one standing
          next to you.

                         RICK
          That's Mommy.

                         EMMA
          Mommy used to have long hair? And
          she wore a bikini?

                         RICK

                         (WISTFULLY)
          Yes she did.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         EMMA
          How come she doesn't wear a bikini
          anymore?

                         GUNNAR
          Is it because of her fat ass?

                         RICK
          I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's
          got a fat ass?

                         GUNNAR
          Mommy.

          LONG BEAT.

                         RICK
          Well, uh, I don't appreciate that
          language, Gunnar. You've got the
          best mom in the whole world--don't
          ever say anything bad about her.
          Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-
          YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the
          other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable
          mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,
          and NO MAKE-UP.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey beautiful, you better get a
          move on--we're supposed to be
          meeting Fred and Grace soon.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, I know, I'm trying.

                         RICK
          Well how long you gonna be?

                         MAGGIE
          Forty-five minutes--sooner if you
          help with the kids.
          Maggie looks to him, hopeful.

                         RICK

                         (NONCHALANT)
          Forty-five minutes is good.
          Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one
          in the tub gets college paid for.
          Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Come on, you bums, let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room,

                         AND WE

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING

          Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up
          and happy-looking.

                         RICK
          I miss going out with you on
          Saturday nights.
          She smiles at him.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, it's just like the old
          days.
          Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.

                         RICK
          Maybe we should make a rule that we
          go out at least six nights a week
          without the kids.
          Maggie GIGGLES.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm serious. We should go out every
          week--just you and me.
          A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
          GLANCE back AT HER ASS.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I think it'd be healthy.

                         MAGGIE
          You gotta be kidding me?
          Maggie pulls away.

                         RICK
          What?

                         MAGGIE
          You just checked out that girl's
          butt.

                         RICK
          I did?

                         MAGGIE
          Yeah, you did, and it's rude.

                         RICK
          Why? You think she saw me?

                         MAGGIE
          saw you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm
          just kind of spacey today.

          GRACE (O.S.)
          Come on, we're late!
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
          waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
          hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
          appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
          Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.

                         MAGGIE
          Grace, let me ask you something:
          Does Fred ever check out other
          women in front of you?

                         GRACE
          No, Fred's not a gawker.
          Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to
          Dr. Lucy.
          We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER
          the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric
          Association Person of the Year.'

          INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Grace and Maggie approach the check-in table.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          There they are!
          ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DR. LUCY GILBERT, a very attractive and
          sophisticated-looking 40-year-old, holding court in the
          corner.

                         GRACE
          Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!

          DR. LUCY
          Girls, thank you so much for
          coming.
          Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.

                         MAGGIE
          Are you kidding me? You're the only
          friend of ours who ever got an
          award--you think we're going to
          miss that?
          ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.

                         FRED
          Do you mind telling me how your
          wife catches you checking out
          another girl? What is this, amateur
          hour?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.

                         RICK
          The girl walked past and I glanced
          back at her for like half a second.

                         FRED
          There's your problem, dumb-ass--
          it's the wrong order. You don't
          wait for the girl to walk past and
          then glance back. You turn when
          she's still fifteen feet in front
          of you...then you wait for her to
          walk into your line of vision.
          Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the
          right.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Observe.
          Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
          holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS
          VIEW and he watches her walk away.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You see? I can't help it if her
          butt walks where I'm already
          looking.

                         RICK

                         (GETTING IT)
          It was your air space.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, guys.
          They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking
          past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD,
          mid-30's.

          RICK AND FRED
          Hey, Missy.

                         MISSY
          (CALLING back to them)
          Don't forget to mingle!
          The guys watch Missy walk away.

                         FRED
          Wow. Missy's looking pretty good
          for someone going through a
          divorce.

                         RICK
          Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard
          they might have to sell the house.

                         FRED
          Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for
          the listing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         RICK
          What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't
          go after the divorcee business
          unless they approach me first.

                         FRED
          Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh?
          As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's
          ass, we...
          REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping
          lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room.

                         GRACE
          Look at those two meatheads
          checking out Missy Frankenfield.
          What, do they think they're
          invisible over there?

                         MAGGIE
          I thought you said Fred wasn't a
          gawker.

                         GRACE
          He was standing right next to you.
          I can't let him know that I know--
          that would take all the fun out of
          it.

                         (CHUCKLES)
          You should see him. He's got some
          stupid move where he looks back
          before the girl passes to make it
          seem like he couldn't help but
          notice her ass. It's pathetic.
          Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are
          getting out.

                         RICK
          How about I drive the babysitter
          home while you go upstairs and
          prepare the altar?
          He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front
          door.

                         MAGGIE
          I want to, honey, but I've got to
          get up early with the kids.

                         RICK
          I'll get up with the kids.

                         MAGGIE
          But I have to go out and buy a gift-
          -they're going to a birthday party
          tomorrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         RICK
          I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take
          the kids to the park, then to the
          party. You can dust stay in bed,,
          get your beauty sleep, and bask in
          the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about
          to give you.

                         MAGGIE
          I love it when you sweet-talk me.
          Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN

          THEIR TRACKS.
          THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing
          there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar.

                         GUNNAR
          Mommy! Daddy!

                         RICK

                         (DEFLATED)
          Little buddy.. .what are you doing
          up?
          Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs
          apologetically to Rick.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          This is just a minor obstacle.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHT

          Rick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in
          the passenger seat. She is on the busty side.

                         RICK
          How were the kids tonight?

                         PAIGE
          Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute--
          all he wants to do is wrestle with
          me.
          Rick smiles at this.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn
          down the air--I'm a little chilly.
          Look--I got goose bumps.
          As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we
          RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are
          PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.
          BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks
          away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry.
          Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE
          ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE
          A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the
          steering wheel tight at ten-and-two.

                         PAIGE
          Thank you.

                         RICK
          'Welcome.

          EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

          The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.

          INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

          Paige hesitates before getting out.

                         PAIGE
          Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?

                         RICK
          Sure.

                         PAIGE
          I was wondering...

                         (SQUINTS NERVOUSLY)
          .could you buy me some beer?
          Rick looks surprised.

                         RICK
          Buy you some.. .How old are you?

                         PAIGE
          Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one
          next week.

                         RICK
          Oh. Happy birthday. That's a
          biggie.

                         PAIGE
          Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for
          me, but she's out of town.

                         (SMILES HOPEFULLY)
          So. . .could ya?

                         RICK
          Uh, I don't know, Paige...I could
          get in a lot of trouble for giving
          alcohol to a minor.

                         PAIGE
          Oh, come on, I'm a junior in
          college. You drank when you were in
          college, didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         RICK
          Well, uh...

                         PAIGE
          Besides, it's so arbitrary. How
          does it make sense that twenty's
          old enough to fight in Iraq or
          watch a porno movie, but it's too
          young to drink a beer?
          Rick shifts in his seat.

                         RICK
          Really? Twenty's old enough to
          uh...?

                         PAIGE
          Fight in Iraq?

                         RICK
          No, the other thing.

                         PAIGE
          Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the
          girls in those things are my age.
          Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I promise no one's gonna find
          out. If you want, you can join me
          down at the lake--we'll listen to
          some tunes and have a couple beers.
          Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks
          hopeful, open.

                         RICK
          I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.

                         PAIGE
          Why not?

                         RICK
          Well... it would be.. .inappropriate.
          Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige
          seems amused by it.

                         PAIGE
          What, is that your grown-up voice?

                         (SMILES)
          That would be inappropriate, Paige.

                         COME ON--

                         RICK
          No, Paige.
          (with an edge)
          What are you thinking? I'm a
          married man and I have a family.
          You think they'd like it if they
          knew I was hanging out at the lake,
          all alone, drinking beer with a
          college girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          She seems taken aback.

                         PAIGE

                         (PUT-OFF)
          I never said alone. My sorority's
          having a party down there tonight.
          Rick CLEARS HIS THROAT, tries to hide his embarrassment.

                         RICK
          All right, better get inside.
          She opens the car door, then glares back at him.

                         PAIGE
          Ewww. What the hell were you
          thinking?

                         RICK
          Go ahead. Scoot along now.
          As she SLAMS the car door, we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rick bounds up the stairs to find Maggie gently closing
          Gunnar's bedroom door.

                         MAGGIE
          Shhhh. He just fell asleep.

                         RICK
          Awesome.
          Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into
          their bedroom where...

          INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          .They find Emma sitting up in their bed, smiling.

                         EMMA
          Can I sleep with you tonight?

                         RICK
          No.

                         EMMA
          Please.

                         RICK
          No. Absolutely not.
          Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Are you serious? Look, besides the
          other thing, I don't like the fact
          that my daughter needs someone to
          sleep with every night--that's not
          going to be good when she goes off
          to college, you know.
          Maggie rolls her eyes.

                         EMMA
          Well.. .can someone read me a story?
          Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.

                         RICK
          Okay, one quick story. Come on,
          jump on my back.
          Emma jumps on Rick's back.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (TO MAGGIE)
          You can get started without me--
          I'll be right back.
          Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room.

          INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

          Emma is putting Rick's HAIR INTO PONYTAILS.

                         RICK
          Okay, honey, this is the last pony
          and then night-night.
          Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him,
          satisfied.

                         EMMA
          There. You look pretty, Daddy.

                         RICK
          Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and
          go to sleep.
          She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on
          both cheeks.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I love you, Emma.

                         EMMA
          I love you, too, Daddy.

          EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom,
          closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY.

                          F

          INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Rick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.

                         RICK
          No. Please, no.
          Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep,
          so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS.
          As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the
          b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She
          listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge
          of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER
          EYES AGAIN, and we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARK - MORNING

          Rick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred
          APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS
          COURTS in the b.g.)

                         FRED
          Hey.

                         RICK
          Hey. How'd you make out?

                         FRED
          Great. Lost both sets.

                         RICK
          So'd you get the business?
          Fred nods and wipes his brow.

                         FRED
          Pretty sure I got the Auto and
          Home. He told me to call his
          accountant on Monday about the
          Life.

                         RICK
          Nice.
          Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with
          their CHILDREN.

                         FRED
          Can you believe the talent here
          today?

                         RICK

                         (PAINED)
          Yeah. I know.
          They NOTICE something O.S..
          THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING
          HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.

                         FRED
          Ouch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK
          CPR girl's back, too.
          Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING
          A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.

                         FRED
          Imagine if we were coming here back
          when we were single?

                         RICK

                         (FALSE BRAVADO)
          Oh baby, the damage we would do.

                         EMMA
          Monkey bars!
          The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.

                         GUNNAR
          Me first!
          Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor
          scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep
          past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and

          WEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS.

                         FRED
          So you get lucky last night?

                         RICK
          Nah, the kids were up when we got
          home. How 'bout you?

                         FRED
          Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked
          right out so I snuck out to the car
          and rubbed one out.
          Rick shoots Fred a look.

                         RICK
          The car? What are you Knight Rider?
          Why didn't you just go in the
          bathroom like a normal guy?

                         FRED
          And get caught by Grace? Can't risk
          it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's
          where I lost my virginity. And
          they're comfy--I just put the seat
          back and turn on the tunes.
          The guys sit on a bench.

                         RICK
          That's one of the things they don't
          tell you when you're young--that
          you'll still be jerking-off after
          you get married. I thought it was
          dust gonna be a teenage thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15

                         FRED
          Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.
          The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee
          Girls play all around them.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You know what I miss the most?

                         RICK
          What?

                         FRED
          The arch.

                         RICK
          What arch?

                         FRED
          You know when you're taking a
          girl's panties off for the first
          time, and you're wondering if she's
          going to stop you, but then she
          gives you that little pelvic arch-
          thrust that tells you that the
          struggle's over, everything's going
          to be okay?
          Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK
          That's a happy moment.

                         FRED
          Yep. Another thing gone forever.
          Rick looks at his watch.

                         RICK
          I should get going, I have to drop
          the kids off at a birthday party.

                         FRED
          You want to grab a coffee after?

                         CUT TO:

           ESTABLISHING SHOT - COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT MORNING

          INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME

          Fred and Rick stand in line.

                         RICK
          Do you have any interest in going
          down to the Patriot's training camp
          one of these days?

                         FRED
          Are you kidding, I'd love that.
          Except...I always feel kind of
          pathetic waiting in line for Tom
          Brady's autograph.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         RICK
          Fred, I was planning on bringing
          the kids.

                         FRED
          Genius! That's the perfect cover!
          Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.

                         RICK
          Uh-oh...
          HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her
          straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her
          white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a
          tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23,
          granola, fresh, Australian, spacey.
          BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.

                         FRED
          Did you see her face? Her face is
          tremendous.

                         RICK
          (chanting, scared)
          Please don't have a nice ass,
          please don't have a nice ass...
          But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS
          IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed.

                         RICK (CONT'D
          Oh, come on! That's ri iculous.

                         FRED
          I know. She's from Australia. Been
          working here about a month.

                         RICK
          Why'd you have to bring me here?!

                         FRED
          Okay, cool it, tiger--here she
          comes.
          Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred.

                         COFFEE GIRL

                         (AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
          Iced coffee with two Splendas
          again?
          Fred wants to say yes, but just nods.

          COFFEE GIRL (CONT'D)
          How about your mate there?

                         RICK

                         (STUNNED)
          Uh...same.
          Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a WANNABE ARTIST-TYPE MALE EMPLOYEE,
          mid-20's (clearly covetous of Coffee Girl) sizing Rick and
          Fred up as he wipes down a counter.

          BACK ON COFFEE GIRL AND OUR GUYS

                         COFFEE GIRL
          (re: Rick's shirt)
          Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin
          with that?

                         RICK
          Uh, sure. What do you recommend?

                         COFFEE GIRL
          They're all good.
          The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee
          Girl.

                         WANNABE
          I'd go with the bran muffin--you
          guys are probably having digestive
          issues at your age, right?
          Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.

                         RICK
          I'll have a blueberry muffin
          please.

                         FRED
          Make it a bran muffin for me.
          Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl
          turns to get their order, we go to...

          SAME SCENE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop.

                         RICK
          Did you notice she's from Cleavage,
          Ohio?

                         FRED
          Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a
          couple of pepperoni slices.
          Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS

          INTENSELY.

                         RICK
          What the hell are you doing?

                         FRED
          Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph
          for my spank bank.

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          Say cheese.

          ED (O.S.)
          Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          Rick and Fred turn to see ED LONG, tall, good-looking, mid-
          40's, standing at the creamer counter behind them.

                         RICK
          Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there.

                         ED
          That's because you were shooting
          laser beams at the java babe.

                         RICK
          Well, no, we were just--

                         ED
          Come on, gentlemen, you're married
          men and she's half your age--grow

                         P-
          The guys can't muster a response.

                          ED (CONT'D)
          So I guess I'll be seeing you at
          the house-warming party this
          weekend.

                         RICK
          Hm?

                         ED
          This Saturday afternoon at the new
          casa--we're inally in and we're
          having a little celebration.

                         RICK
          Oh, I don't know if we can--

                         ED
          Your wives already RSVP'd.

                         RICK
          Right on.

                         ED
          'Til then.
          Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them.

                          ED (CONT'D)
           Come on, pound the potato.
          Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with
          theirs. Then Ed leaves.

                         FRED

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          What a d-bag.

                         RICK
          He's right though.
          Fred looks at Rick.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          What are we doing sitting here
          gawking at her for? We're married
          men--it's creepy.

                         FRED
          I don't see what the big deal is--
          we're not hurting anyone. What is
          he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me
          what I can look at now? For God
          sakes, don't take that away from me-
          -it's all I got!
          As Rick thinks about this, we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A BABY MONITOR - PULL BACK to reveal that it's in
          the middle of a POKER TABLE next to a pile of ONE-DOLLAR
          BILLS. Sitting around the table PLAYING LIAR'S POKER are
          Rick, Fred, GARY, HOG-HEAD, BAKER, and FLATS, all in their
          mid-30's to mid-40's. Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is
          husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and
          squirrelly.

                         BAKER
          Rick, you open.
          Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him
          and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS.

                         RICK
          Four 9's.

                         FRED
          Hey, where's Coakley? How come he
          didn't show?

                         GARY
          Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals.
          The guys nod their approval.

                         BAKER
          Man, imagine being Coakley? The
          guy's single, he's loaded, chicks
          love him, he doesn't have to answer
          to anybody.

                         GARY
          That's the life.

                         FRED
          That is the life.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Let me ask you something: What
          would you guys pay to have your way
          with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an
          entire weekend?
          The guys perk up as they think about this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          You get to pick any one you want--
          and you know up front that you
          won't get her pregnant, no
          diseases, you're never gonna hear
          from her again, and your wife will
          never find out.

                         GARY
          How's it possible to know that my
          wife won't find out?

                         HOG-HEAD

                         (ANNOYED)
          It's not. I'm saying if it were
          possible, like if I was a magic
          genie and I could grant you this
          wish but then make it like it never
          even happened.

                         FLATS
          But would I still have memory of
          it?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Oh yeah. Great memories.

                         GARY
          Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for
          that.
          Baker shoots him a look.

                         BAKER
          You cheap,bastard. We're talking
          about an investment that gets your
          rocks off and protects your wife's
          feelings. I'd pay five grand.

                         RICK
          Wow.

                         GARY
          Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street,
          but us public school teachers
          aren't getting any of that bail-out
          money you're over-tipping everyone
          with.
          Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.

                         MAGGIE
          Hey, guys.

                         RICK
          Oh, hey, honey. How was the book
          club?

                         MAGGIE
          Great.

                         FRED
          What did you guys read this month?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MAGGIE
          Hemingway.

                         GARY
          Old Man and the Sea?

                         MAGGIE
          No, Muriel's yoga book.
          The guys LAUGH.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Actually, we were supposed to be
          discussing The Sun Also Rises but
          Grace pulled out a bottle of
          tequila and that was the end of
          that. So, did the kids go down
          easy?

                         RICK
          Gunnar and Emma stalled for a
          while, but they weren't bad.

                         MAGGIE
          How about the baby?
          Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.

                         RICK
          Not a peep.

                         MAGGIE
          Great job. Now win some money,
          honey.
          She kisses Rick and walks out of the room.

                         GARY
          I wish I could drink tequila. It's
          a great buzz but it always gives me
          the spins and then I have to go
          home early.

                         FRED
          You want to know a sure cure for
          the spins?
          Fred puts a hand over his right eye.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Just cover up one eye. It balances
          out the equilibrium.

                         RICK
          Or you could find a nice 12-step
          program.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          As Maggie gets to the top of the stairs, she can hear the
          O.S. SOUND OF THE BABY CRYING. She walks down the hall,
          opens the Baby's door and REACTS.
          HER POV - the exhausted and sweaty Baby is standing in his
          crib, SOBBING. The baby monitor is on the dresser next to
          the crib BLARING out LAUGHTER from the poker game.

          INT. BABY NURSERY - CONTINUOUS


                         MAGGIE
          Oh, you poor thing...
          She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Silly Daddy... he got the monitors
          mixed-up. Have you been listening
          to those loud-mouths all night?
          As Maggie moves to turn off the monitor, we HEAR:

          FLATS (O.S.)
          .So how 'bout you, Fred--how much
          would you pay to s end an entire
          weekend with one of the hottest
          women in the world?
          Maggie hesitates and LISTENS IN.

          FRED (O.S.)
          I wouldn't have to pay--I'm married
          to her.
          There's a BEAT, then the guys EXPLODE IN LAUGHTER.

          FRED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          No, seriously, I'd pay five grand,
          easy.
          Maggie's JAW DROPS.

          BACK ON POKER GAME

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          I'd have to figure out a way to get
          it out of the bank without Grace
          noticing, but I suppose the genie
          could help me with that.

                         HOG-HEAD
          You could put me down for seven-
          five.

                         BAKER
          Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't
          have seven-five.
          More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         FLATS
          So what's your number, Rick?

                         RICK
          Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know...

                         FRED
          Come on.. any girl you choose. You
          get to do anything you want with
          her, and your wife will never find
          out. It's completely harmless, a
          one-time thing--what would you pay
          for that?
          BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to
          the monitor.

          RICK (O.S.)
          I honestly don't know, fellas.

          BAKER (O.S.)
          Ballpark.
          PUSH IN ON MAGGIE as she waits nervously for her husband's
          answer.

          RICK (O.S.)
          Well... I've got a great wife and I
          sure wouldn't want to hurt her
          feelings, so...
          Maggie SMILES at this. That's my guy!

          RICK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I guess the real question is,
          what wouldn't I pay?!
          The guys LAUGH O.S. and MAGGIE REACTS, as we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MAGGIE AND RICK'S KITCHEN - LATER

          Maggie's got Rick backed into a corner.

                         MAGGIE
          What wouldn't you pay?!

                         RICK
          I didn't really mean it, honey.
          (scared, defenseless)
          They kind of put me on the spot.
          Look, some of the other guys were
          throwing out some pretty hefty
          bids.

                         MAGGIE
          What does that have to do with
          anything?

                         RICK
          Well... I'm the host of the party, I
          didn't want to be a buzz-kill.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         24
          Maggie squints, appalled.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Look, all I was saying was, there's
          no amount of money I wouldn't pay
          to protect you and the kids.

                         MAGGIE
          How is having sex with a hooker
          protecting me and the kids?

                         RICK
          No one said anything about hookers.

                         MAGGIE
          You were paying for sex--what would
          you call her?

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Well.. .the genie was getting the
          dough, not her.

                         (RECOVERING)
          Come on, be reasonable, it was just
          guy-talk--it's not like it could
          really happen.
          Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Love you!

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          Maggie, Grace, and Dr. Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant.
          Dr. Lucy listens quietly to the women.

                         GRACE
          Fred said five grand? What a
          blowhard!

                         MAGGIE
          You know what's even funnier? Hog-
          head McCormick said he'd pay seven
          grand.

                         GRACE
          What?! That bum hasn't worked since
          the dot-com bust--his wife supports
          him!
          The girls LAUGH.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Well, look on the bright side: At
          least they're not cheating on us.

                         MAGGIE
          Sometimes I wonder if it would be
          better if they did cheat and get it
          over with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          DR. LUCY
          You mean, rather than take the slow
          boat to resentment?
          The girls look to Dr. Lucy.

          DR. LUCY (CONT'D
          I'm just saying.. .maybe a little
          freedom would be good for them. And
          for you.

                         (BEAT)
          Have you ever considered giving
          them a hall pass?

                         GRACE
          A what?

          DR. LUCY
          A hall pass. A week off from
          marriage.
          Grace and Maggie stop chewing.

                         MAGGIE
          Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let
          them go out and cheat?

          DR. LUCY
          I'm saying give them a week off
          from marriage.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, most married men have foggy
          memories of their single days and
          they somehow get under the
          impression that if not for you,
          they'd be able to be with ail those
          women who entice them.

                         GRACE
          That's Fred. He thinks because he
          sees big tits everywhere and then
          still comes home for dinner that I
          should be welcoming him at the door
          like some conquering hero.
          Dr. Lucy smiles.

          DR. LUCY
          Well, maybe it's time to let them
          go out there and find out what it's
          really like.

                         MAGGIE
          Wow. You're talking about the
          nuclear option.
          Maggie ponders the idea.

          DR. LUCY
          There's a wonderful principle in
          psychology called 'reactance
          theory.' It basically states that
          if you're constantly told you can't
          do something, you want to do it
          more than ever. And conversely, if
          you remove the taboo, you remove
          the obsession.
          Grace makes a 't' sound.

          I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you
          try a hall pass out on your husband
          and let us know how it works out.

          DR. LUCY
          Oh, I have.

          You're telling us you let Charlie

          Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.

          DR. LUCY
          I am not telling you that. I am
          telling you that I gave him the
          freedom to choose for himself.

          All I know is...our marriage is
          better than ever.
          Grace and Maggie think about this.

                         GRACE
          I don't know. There's a reason that
          men evolved and apes didn't. It's
          because women demanded more.

          EXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - DAY

          There are several flashy cars out front of this huge
          McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of
          Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet
          them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a
          Polo shirt, just like his father.)

                         GRACE
          There he is! The lord of the manor!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         ED
          Come on, everyone in the shack! The
          grand tour's about to begin!

          INT. STUDY - AFTERNOON

          Ed and his wife KIMMY (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead
           Rick, Fred, Maggie, Grace, and SEVERAL OTHER GUESTS into a
          large wood-paneled study. (The Long's 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
           sticks to her mother's side WEARING A MATCHING DRESS.)

                          ED
          I call it headquarters.
          LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife,
          MANDY, (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe.

                         MANDY
          Un-believable.

                         ED
          That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.

                         LARRY
          It's epic, Ed.
          Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR.

                         ED

                         (RE: HUMIDOR)
          And this over here--this is the war
          room. The temperature in there
          never goes above fifty-four
          degrees, never below fifty-three. I
          even threw in a back-up generator
          in case we lose power and the main
          generator doesn't kick in. Now who
          wants a Cubano? They're the real
          deal--Coakley snagged them on his
          trip to Havana.

                         KIMMY
          Wait a second, Ed, first I want to
          show them Lny headquarters.
          Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes.

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          It looks like a Waterworks showroom. Despite its bloated
          opulence, Grace and Maggie can't help but be impressed.

                         KIMMY
          It's my paradise.

                         ED
          With a price tag north of one
          hundred and forty large, it better
          be paradise.
          Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just
          then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared.

                         GRACE
          Hey, where did Fred go?
          Rick turns and sees that he's missing.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick walks down a hall and finds Fred in a guest room
          watching a baseball game on TV.

                         RICK
          What are you doing?

                         FRED
          I can't take these look-at-how-much-
          I-own parties. It's obnoxious.
          Rick nods and sits down beside him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          When I bought my completely-loaded
          Honda Odyssey, I didn't go around
          bragging about it, did I?

                         RICK
          Well, kind of. You made me drive
          around town with you for two hours,
          remember?

                         FRED

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          I thought you'd want to watch a
          movie in a mini-van. You never got
          to watch a movie in a mini-van
          before, did you?
          Rick shrugs.

                         RICK
          Why'd you have to hook your boat up
          to it?

                         FRED
          Because it's the Touring Edition,
          numb-skull. The thing can tow more
          weight than ninety percent of the
          pick-ups out there!

          Everybody is admiring the antique fireplace.

                         KIMMY
          The mantle actually came all the
          way from Tuscany, which is in
          Europe.

                         ED

          see that--they'll think we're
          wackos.
          Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN
          revealing a SAFE ROOM.

          INT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Maggie, Grace, and the others follow Ed into a safe room
          filled with VIDEO MONITORS surveilling all the rooms in the
          house. When Kimmy ENTERS she pushes a button CLOSING THE

          WALL BEHIND THEM.

          Oh my God... this is like secret
          agent stuff.

                         KIMMY
          I think having a safe room is a bit
          over the top, but Ed feels with our
          two little ones you can never be
          too cautious.

                         GRACE
          Aw, you're such a good daddy.

                         MAGGIE

          Rick can't even set up the baby
          monitors right.
          Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the
          master bedroom.

          mini-van when you don't even have
          any kids?

          FRED (ON MONITOR)
          You don't know much about the
          insurance game, do you, Rick? When
          you pull into a person's driveway
          to sell them life insurance, who do
          you think they'd rather see? A hot-
          shot in a Porsche or a family man
          in a mini-van? Hm?
          Rick looks around the empty room.

          RICK (ON MONITOR)
          Hey, where'd everyone go?

          Thanks for coming to the war room,
          old chap. By the way, did I mention

          the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her
          little boy for sneaking a frog into the house.

                         MAGGIE
          You know what really troubles me?
          The thing that you're all so
          obsessed with is meaningless to
          you. It's really just about numbers
          with you guys.

          Rick, you can't even tel me the
          month you lost your virginity. I
          can tell you the exact day and hour
          that I lost mine.
          Rick seems a little embarrassed by this.

                         RICK
          Well, virginity is different for
          guys.

                         MAGGIE
          The point is, obviously I like sex,
          too--it means something to me--but
          I don't walk around gawking at
          every guy I see.

                         RICK
          All right, so I occasionally notice
          other women. I'm sorry.

          leave the house in the morning 'til
          the moment I get home, I pretty
          much notice every woman in my path.

          But it's not how you think it is,
          Mags. It's like... it's like a
          curse. I don't want to notice, but
          I can't help it. It's always been
          like that. I figured that when I
          c jot married that would be it, but
          it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give
          two shits about marriage.

          No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our
          sex life is great--not that I
          wouldn't mind a little more, but--
          look, one thing has nothing to do
          with the other. I think about sex a
          lot--all guys do--that's just the
          way it is.
          Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope.
          No one speaks for a few moments. Then:

                         MAGGIE
          I'm giving you a hall pass.

                         RICK
          A what?

                         MAGGIE
          One week off from marriage.

                         RICK
          You mean, like a trial separation?
          You are seriously overreacting.

                         MAGGIE
          It's not a separation, it's a hall
          pass. You can do whatever you want.
          Get it out of your system.

                         RICK

                         (BEAT)
          Wait a minute--are you for real?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         MAGGIE
          It's not a yes or no offer, and
          it's not a debate. You're getting a
          hall pass.
          As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

          Maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS
          dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles
          coming from a TV in another room.

                         RICK
          'Morning.

                         MAGGIE
          (not facing him)
          There's a couple hard-boiled eggs
          in a bowl there for you.

                         RICK
          I'm gonna have to take them to go,
          hon, I've got a showing in fifteen
          minutes.
          Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and
          kisses her on the cheek.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey, about this hall pass
          business.. .1 don't want it and I
          don't need it. All I need is--

                         MAGGIE
          I told you, this isn't negotiable.
          She turns and faces him.

                         RICK
          You're really serious about this?

                         MAGGIE
          Rick, this isn't something that
          I...look, I really think you need
          this. I think we need this.
          Rick doesn't know what to say.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          This afternoon I'm taking the kids
          out to my parent's beach house.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         RICK
          For how long?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MAGGIE
          We'll be back in one week. And as
          far as I'm concerned, starting
          right now. .. you have the week off
          from marriage.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY

          This is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in
          his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker
          For Sale sign with Rick's name on it.

          INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - SAME

          Rick is showing the kitchen to a COUPLE, mid-40's, when Fred

          ENTERS.

                         RICK
          Hey, what are you doing here?

                         FRED
          I called your office and they told
          me you were in the neighborhood.
          Rick turns to the couple.

                         RICK
          Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred
          Searing. Fred, this is Harold and
          Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up
          here from Long Island.

                         FRED
          Well, mazel tov, folks.
          The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a
          card.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Here, let me give you my card.
          Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm
          the go-to mensch in town.

                         HAROLD GOLDBERG
          We're good on insurance.
          Rick quickly jumps in.

                         RICK
          (to the Goldbergs)
          Uh, why don't you two take another
          look around and if you have any
          questions I'll be right here.

                         HAROLD GOLDBERG
          Thank you.
          The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         RICK

                         (HUSHED)
          What the he 1 are you doing--I'm
          trying to make a sale here.

                         FRED
          You weren't picking up your cell--I
          wanted to see how much trouble you
          got in last night. You know what
          Grace made me do? She made me call
          the Longs and apologize.
          Rick flinches.

                         RICK
          Oof .

                         FRED
          How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out
          when you got home?

                         RICK
          Uh... sort of.
          Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's
          aren't listening. Then:

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          She gave me a hall pass.

                         FRED
          A what?

                         RICK
          A week off from marriage to do
          whatever I want. She's going to her
          parents' house down the Cape 'til
          next Sunday.
          Fred SNICKERS.

                         FRED
          Yeah, right.

                         RICK
          I'm serious.

                         FRED
          You're full of shit.

                         RICK
          Fred, it's true. You think I could
          make something like this up?
          Fred stares at him.

                         FRED
          I don't get it--why aren't you more
          excited?

                         RICK
          Well...I don't know how I feel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         FRED
          About...?

                         RICK
          The hall pass. Something about it
          isn't right.

                         FRED
          You mean, like, you think Maggie
          might have a brain tumor or
          something?

                         RICK
          No. I mean, just because my wife
          tells me it's okay to cheat... is
          it?

                         FRED
          Uh, yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          Why can't you just accept the fact
          that your wife is a goddamn saint,
          Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see?
          She gets it!

                         RICK
          Yeah, but there's a part of me
          that's saying, 'Wow, you must have
          pushed her pretty hard to get her
          to this point.' And is that good
          for a marriage? That your wife is
          willing to try something this
          insane?
          Fred can't believe his ears.

                         FRED
          Absolutely!

                         (BEAT)
          Come on, doesn't it bother you that
          our wives dreams all come true, but
          ours don't? Look at Maggie; when
          she was a kid she played house--you
          g a ve her a house. She played with
          her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a
          Viking. She played mommy--you made
          her a mommy.

                         RICK
          The oven's a GE.

                         FRED
          It's a real gas oven! And what
          about you, huh? Come on, man, your
          wife is living her dreams.. .and now
          it's time for you to live yours.
          As Rick thinks about this, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Fred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         FRED
          I don't know, I think this is some
          very forward-thinking on Maggie's
          part.

                         GRACE
          Quit lobbying--you're not getting a
          hall pass. And you mark my words,
          this is going to end up biting
          Maggie in the ass.
          At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her.

                         FRED
          Why would I need a hall pass? I've
          got you.

                         GRACE
          Not tonight you don't. I'm too
          bloated and I have cramps.

                         FRED
          I don't mind.

                         GRACE
          Fred, do I have to spell it out for
          you? I'm having my period.

                         FRED

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          Yeah, I got that.
          He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away.

                         GRACE
          Come on, hon, give me a break. Not
          tonight.
          Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom.

                         FRED

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Oh, shit--I forgot to take the
          trash out.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home.
           We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car
          and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're...
          LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting
          in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is
          slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.
          A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later
          BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.
          As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to
          figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred
          continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM
          FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now
          only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE

          CAR.
          The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred
          continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs
          out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES
          IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each
          other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we...

                         CUT TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have
          gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on.
          PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred
          standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a
          furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.)

                         OFFICER #1
          All right, ma'am, if you say he's
          yours.. .you can have him.
          The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS.

                         GRACE
          Thank you, officers.
          Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the
          door shuts, we HEAR:

          GRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          WHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF

          IN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?!
          As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go...
          CLOSE ON a smiling Fred.

                         FRED
           I got a Hall Pass!

          INT. RICK'S OFFICE - DAY

          Rick is at his desk staring at a giddy Fred.

                         RICK
          How?

                         FRED
          Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can
          you believe it?! I got a hall pass!
          Rick stands up, elated.

                         RICK
          And I've got a hall pass!

                         FRED
          We both have hall passes!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         RICK
          When does yours start?
          Fred looks at his watch.

                         FRED
          Twenty-three minutes ago! She just
          left for the Cape--she's staying
          with Maggie. It's just you and me
          for the next six days!

                         RICK
          Oh my God, do you realize how much
          easier this is going to make it--
          having a hall pass partner?

                         FRED
          And it's not just me--Baker, Gary,
          and Hog-head are coming out with us
          tonight!

                         RICK
          No way?! They got hall passes,
          too?!

                         FRED
          No, no, no--they just want to
          watch.
          Rick grows concerned.

                         RICK
          You think that's a good idea,
          letting them in on it? What if they
          blab and it gets around town--it
          might embarrass our wives.

                         FRED
          Don't worry, I already talked to
          them. Their lips are sealed.
          Rick and Fred smile.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
           We're living the dream, baby!

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Rick, Fred, and their MIDDLE-AGED POSSE (Baker, Hog-head &
           Gary) walk across a boulevard like rock stars. (Think of the
          SLO-MO shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs.) Nobody

          march straight into ...APPLEBEE'S.

          They step up to the bar.

          Five MGD's, my friend.
          While waiting for the beers, the guys CHECK OUT THE SCENE.
          It's mostly FAMILIES, a few YOUNG COUPLES.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          The guy at the Holiday Inn Express
          told me this place really kicks in
          around nine-thirty.

                         BAKER
          Hey, why are you staying at a hotel
          if your wives are out of town?

                         FRED
          Well, we can't very well take babes
          back to our places--if they know
          where we live they might end up
          stalking us.

                         RICK
          Besides, I wouldn't be able to
          concentrate with all the pictures
          everywhere and the kids' cut-outs
          all over the fridge.

                         GARY
          Yeah, isn't it weird how your own
          kids can creep you out sometimes?
          Rick shoots Gary a look.

                         FRED
          I get the feeling there's a lot of
          divorcees in this place.

                         HOG-HEAD
          That's good. Divorcees are into
          kinky sex--that's why they're
          divorced.
          Just then the BARTENDER arrives with the Miller Genuine
          Drafts and the guys CLINK BOTTLES.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          So come on, point out which girls
          you guys are gonna do tonight.
          Gary elbows Fred as he spots TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN at the end
          of the bar.

                         GARY
          What about those two? Why don't you
          bang them?

                         FRED
          No way. They're doing the

                         SWEATSHIRT-AROUND-THE-WAIST THING--
          they're obviously hiding something
          back there.

          Okay, how about the blonde hostess?
          Maybe somebody should nail her,
          huh?

                         RICK
          Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got
          a whole week.
          Baker looks around at the lame bar scene.

                         BAKER
          Are you guys sure that Applebee's
          is the best place to be picking up
          women?

                         RICK

          Garden?

          Nah, that's only good on Thursday
          nights.

          That's where we should be.

          He's in Iceland.

          Look, before we go bagging any
          chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef
          in me.

          Hey, I got a guy over at Outback
          Steak House who could set us up.

          Ooooh, he's got pull over at
          Outback. Wow.

          these and hit the road.

          As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary.

          Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have
          any connections at 7/11, do ya?
          Maybe someone could hook me up with
          a player's card so I can cut right
          to the front of the raspberry
          slurpy line.

           Grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while
           Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel. The kids
           are asleep and the place is quiet.

                         GRACE
          I think we might've made a huge
          mistake.

                         MAGGIE
          Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why
          don t you just try to get some
          sleep?
          Grace turns to Maggie.

                         GRACE
          Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't
          understand you--how can you Just
          sit there and read knowing that
          Rick could be making out with a
          supermodel right now?
          Maggie doesn't answer.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Our husbands aren't married this
          week. Do you know what husbands do
          when they're not married?

                         MAGGIE
          Shh. You're going to wake the kids.

                         GRACE
          Are you going to sit there and tell
          me you're not the least bit
          concerned about what they're doing
          right now?
          Maggie SIGHS.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay... I'm a little concerned.

          Grace flops into the chair across from her.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Of course I'm concerned. But what
          choice did we have?

                         GRACE
          We could've kept the status quo. I
          mean, were things really that bad
          that we had to try something this
          extreme?

                         MAGGIE
          For me they were.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, you may call this a hall
          pass, but for me it's more of a
          Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I
          don't know what else to do.
          Grace looks at Maggie, surprised.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Remember last week when we went to
          Lucy's award thing?
          Grace nods.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          That night when we got home, Rick
          and I were gonna.. .you know... and I
          was waiting for him in bed while he
          tucked the kids in, and I started
          wondering who he would be thinking
          about during sex. Would it be the
          girl he checked out on the way into
          the party? Or would it be Missy
          Frankenfield--because I noticed him
          gawking at her? Or how about one of
          the waitresses, or maybe somebody
          he saw at work that day? Then when
          he came into the room, I did
          something I'd never done before: I
          pretended to be asleep.

                         GRACE
          You're kidding me? You've never
          done that? I do that all the time!
          Maggie almost smiles.

                         MAGGIE
          Look, I understand that people have
          fantasies and that you're not
          always thinking about the person
          you're with.

                         GRACE
          That's for sure.

                         MAGGIE
          But it's just...I don't know... it's
          been too long since I felt that he
          was thinking about me.

          They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then:

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I need this hall pass to work,
          Grace, because if it doesn't, I
          don't know what's going to happen.

          Eating it isn't like smoking it.
          It's a much mellower buzz--you'll
          just feel relaxed.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Are they chocolatey?
          As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing.

                         RICK
          Hog-head, come on, who eats pot
          brownies at eleven in the morning
          when they're playing golf?

                         HOG-HEAD
          John Daly?

                         GARY
          And by the way, Rick, this is
          spring break! You've got a hall
          pass! Live it up, man! It'll
          probably help your rap with the
          ladies later.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Gary's right--when are we ever
          gonna get the chance to do pot
          brownies again?
          Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          Mmm. These are yummy.

                         RICK
          You don't even have a hall pass.

                         HOG-HEAD
          So? I can still live vicariously
          through you guys, can't I?

                         RICK
          It's not vicarious if you're
          actually doing it.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Whatever. Just hit your ball.
          Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE.

                         FRED
          Oh, what the hell, it's not like my
          game can get any worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT.
          Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE.

                         RICK
          All right, give me one of those
          things.
          As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we

                          75 MINUTES LATER

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

          A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their
          cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of
          them speak. Then:

                         FRED
          What kind of soap do you use?

                         RICK

                         (BEAT)
          You mean in the shower?

                         FRED
          Yeah.

                         RICK
          Dove.

                         FRED
          Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry
          your skin so much.
          Fred stares into space.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Sometimes it's hard to wash off,
          though. Because of the moisturizer.
          You ever notice--?

                         RICK
          I think Hog-head's dead.
          Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN
          A SAND TRAP. He's not moving.

                         FRED

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hog-head...? Are you okay?
          As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an
          elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart.

                         RANGER
          What the hell is he doing?
          Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority
          figure.

                         RICK
          Uh, he's having back spasms.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         RANGER
          Not him. Him.
          Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the
          MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM.

                         RICK

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Gary! What are you doing?!

                         GARY
          I don't know--you tell me!
          Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick,
          annoyed.

                         RANGER
          Look, this is the third time I've
          had to flag your group and you're
          only on the fourth hole. Now if I
          have to come out here again, you're
          done for the day.

                         RICK
          Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir.
          The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO
          ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them.

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

          The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another
          fairway.

                         RICK
          Think. Where did you last see it?

                         GARY
          On the course.

                         RICK
          Where on the course?

                         GARY
          I don't know--on a fairway, I
          think. I clot out, grabbed my club,
          took a swing, and when I turned
          around it had disappeared.

                         RICK
          You're serious? You're telling us
          you lost your golf cart?

                         FRED

                         (STONER VOICE)
          Dude, where's my golf cart?

          Shut up, Fred.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Guys, I gotta go poo again.

                         GARY
          I didn't lose it, I think it was
          stolen.

                         RICK

                         (ANNOYED)
          Who would steal a golf cart?
          Gary shrugs.

                         GARY
          Criminals?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Does anyone have any napkins?

                         GARY
          Look, all I know is I had it on the
          seventh tee and now it's gone.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about? We're
          only on the sixth hole.

                         GARY
          What? Did we miss a hole? Where's
          my kids?
          Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it
          together. Then he NOTICES something O.S..

                         RICK
          Oh, come on, man!
          ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker
          PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his
          O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and
          the guys look up.
          THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading
          straight for them.

                         FRED
          Run for it!
          The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick
          and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF
          THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger

          HOT IN PURSUIT.

                         GARY
          He's gaining on us!

                         RICK
          I can't go any faster, I've got it
          floored!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         FRED
          Cut through the woods!
          Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and
          Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART.
          With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog-
          head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick
          slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then
          he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE

          WOODS.

          EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

          Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having
          lunch with their two young children. Their 7-Year-Old
          Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year-
          Old Son is dressed like the father.

                         7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
          Hey, Mom, look!
          The family turns to see...
          THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary
          are driving the golf cart down the city street. They stop at
          a traffic light beside them. All the guys stare straight
          ahead, ZOMBIE-LIKE, except for Fred who NOTICES the Longs.
          He nods.

                         FRED
          Ed. Kimmy. Clones.
          The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the
          busy intersection, we go
          BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads.

                         KIMMY
          Their poor wives.

                         DAY 3

          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

          It's a picture perfect day as a THOUSAND PEOPLE watch a Cape
          Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic
          blankets. The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom
          of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, MAGGIE'S PARENTS, and the
          kids are CLAPPING ALONG WITH THE CROWD.
          CRACK! The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the
          TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after
          the game.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch
          Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and
          REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach.
          Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a
          strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a
          perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN.

                         GERRY
          Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming
          out and supporting us.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, it was fun. You guys looked
          good.

                         GERRY
          Thanks.
          Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging
          him on.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          So...we saw you sitting up there
          with those little kids--are you
          nannies or something?
          The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile.

                         MAGGIE
          No, they're my kids.

                         GERRY

                         (DUBIOUS)
          Yeah, right. You have three kids?

                         MAGGIE
          Uh-huh.
          A couple other PLAYERS amble over.

                         GERRY
          Dudes, they're not nannies, they're
          mommies.

                         PLAYER #2
          No way?!

                         GRACE
          Well, she is, not me. I'm not old
          enough yet.
          Maggie and the players LAUGH.

          RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)
          Guys!
          The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN,
          approaching with MAGGIE'S FATHER, mid-70's.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Time to pack things up--let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          The Players quickly scatter.

                         MAGGIE'S FATHER
          Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman-
          -the coach.
           Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head
          of hair and an easy-going manner.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          I hope those clowns weren't
          bothering you.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, no, they were sweet.

                         GRACE
          Yeah. Cute kids.

                         MAGGIE
          So you're the guy who's been taking
          money off my dad every Saturday on
          the golf course?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          I hate to break it to you but your
          old man's the one who's been taking
          all the money--he's a thief.
          Maggie's Father LAUGHS.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Hey, everyone's coming back to my
          place for some beers and a barbecue-
          -why don't you join us?

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the
          kids home.

                         MAGGIE'S FATHER
          Your mom and I will take 'em home.
          You two go out and have a good time-
          -cripes, you haven't been out all
          week.
          Grace perks up at this.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really

                         HADN'T PLANNED--

                         GRACE
          Excuse me, can I have a word with
          you?
          Grace pulls Maggie aside.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          What's your problem?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are
          barely out of college, and, in case
          you've forgotten, we're married.

                         GRACE
          To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred
          had the week off from marriage. So
          remind me again--who are we married
          to?
          Maggie thinks about this.

                         MAGGIE
          Well...I guess one beer won't kill
          us.

                         GRACE

                         (SMILING)
          That's my girl.
          Grace glances over at the ballplayers.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Why shouldn't we have fun? God
          knows our guys are living it up.

          out with a guy or let him blow you?
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that...

          INT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          .Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and
          devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about
          fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's
          ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          And you've gotta pick one or
          someone in your family will die--
          that's the rule.

                         GARY
          Oh boy, that's a toughie.

                         FRED
          How long would you have to make-out
          with him?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Ten minutes.

                         RICK
          Tongue?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Of course.

                         FRED
          And how long would he have to blow
          you?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Seven minutes.

                         GARY
          Oof. I mean, getting blown by a
          dude is bad, but making out with a
          guy, it's so.. .intimate.

                         RICK
          You think it's more intimate than
          getting blown by a guy?

                         GARY
          Way more.

                         BAKER
          All right, the hell with this shit,
          I'm outta here.
          Baker gets up from his stool.

                         RICK

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          What? Why?

                         BAKER
          I wanted to watch you guys pick up
          chicks, not talk about dicks.

                         FRED
          Hey, greased lightning, let off the
          gas--sometimes these things take
          time.

                         GARY
          Baker's right. This is day three
          and you haven't even talked to a
          girl.

                         RICK

                         (POINTED)
          That's not exactly accurate, Gary.
          Thanks to your scrumptious
          brownies, I did spend half of last
          night talking to Judy on the drug-
          and-poison hotline.
          Hog-head and Gary stand.

                         HOG-HEAD
          I guess I'm gonna get going, too.

                         GARY
          Yeah, this is boring. You guys are
          pussies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         FRED
          Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk
          to any girls.

                         BAKER
          We don't have hall passes!

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          Come on, guys, let's go.
          The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and
          turns.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Hey, guys, it's all right if you
          strike-out.. .but for godsakes, at
          least take a couple of swings.
          A moment later the guys are gone and a humbled Rick and Fred
          sit there feeling alone.

                         FRED

                         (BEING BRAVE)
          This is actually good--you know,
          that they're leaving. You don't
          need five hunters to bag two birds.

                         RICK
          No, you do not. And I love those
          guys but, let's be honest, they're
          not exactly chick-magnets.

                         FRED
          You can say that again. Yep, the
          steak always looks better if you
          trim away some of the fat. And
          let's face it, we are the steak.

                         RICK
          Dream team, baby.
          The guys CLINK BEERS. Then:

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Maybe we should call the girls and
          ask them to come home.
          Fred glances at him, aghast.

                         FRED
          What?

                         RICK
          Who are we kidding, man? Do you
          really think we're going to be
          picking up any girls this week?

                         FRED
          Why wouldn't we?

                         RICK
          Because that's not us anymore.

                         FRED
          Wait a second. You want to quit?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         RICK
          Fred, we're not the same guys we
          were fifteen years ago, back when
          we were single. We've changed.
          Fred stares at him, incredulous.

                         FRED
          No, man, you've changed. All you
          care about is yourself--what about
          all the guys out there who are
          counting on us to make this thing
          work?

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?

                         FRED
          Don't you get it?

                         (DRAMATIC BEAT)
          We're the chosen ones!
          Fred stands up and points at Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          That's right--this thing is bigger
          than us! Our wives didn't give us
          this hall pass, the good Lord did!
          And what do we have to show for it?
          Nothing.

                         RICK
          Come off it, Fred. Obviously
          hooking up isn't something we
          really want--if it was, we could've
          done it by now.

                         FRED
          Could we have?
          Rick is taken aback by this.

                         RICK

                         (WANING CONFIDENCE)
          Well ...of course. I mean, if we'd
          really wanted to.

                         FRED
          Guess what? I did want to. And you
          know how close I got? We're three
          days in and the only woman I've
          spoken to was our waitress at
          Outback. And she never even made
          eye-contact.

                         RICK
          I don't really care if some
          waitress makes eye-contact. I want
          to go home--I miss my wife and
          kids.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         FRED
          Let me explain something to you: If
          Grace and Maggie find out we can't
          get laid on our own, they'll start
          thinking we need them to get laid.
          Do you know what that'll do to the
          balance of power in our homes?
          It'll destroy it!
          Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.

                         RICK
          Well, what if we just tell them
          that we did hook up?

                         FRED
          We can't. Grace'll know. She always
          knows when I'm lying.

                         RICK
          Hey, what about a massage parlor?

                         FRED
          No! That's giving up.
          Fred glares at him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You don't get it, do you? A hall
          pass ain't all about sex. It's
          about being man enough to pick up a
          woman even though you may not be
          what--in the traditional sense--is
          considered...
          (makes quotes with

                         FINGERS)
          .good-looking, or...
          (finger quotes again)
          .appealing.
          Rick seems stung by this news.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, if we can't show that
          something positive can come from
          having a hall pass, then the whole
          concept is dead. Not just for
          us...but for all mankind.
          Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a

          RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE.

                         RICK
          All right, let's get out of here. I
          know exactly where we should be.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

          The party's in full swing. A hundred or so PLAYERS, PLAYER'S
          GIRLFRIENDS, and FRIENDS are in and out of the pool, drinking
          beer and rocking out to Arcade Fire on the boombox.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the
          b.g. we see Grace PLAYING VOLLEYBALL in the pool (still in
          the shorts and t-shirt she wore that afternoon.)

                         MAGGIE
          So how about you, Rick, do you have
          any children?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom
          keeps talking about hooking me up
          with your cousin Kate.
          Maggie LAUGHS.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          That's not a good sign.

                         MAGGIE
          No, I hardly know her. She moved to
          Miami when I was eight.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          That's what your mom said. I coach
          at the University of Miami.

                         MAGGIE
          Then you should go out with her.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nice try.

                         (BEAT)
          So how about yourself--how long you
          been married?

                         MAGGIE
          Uh...fourteen years. We were
          college sweethearts.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nice. And where is he this week?

                         MAGGIE
          He's up in Boston.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Poor guy. All work and no play,
          huh?
          Maggie forces a smile.

                         MAGGIE
          Something like that.
          Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO

          GERRY'S SHOULDERS.

                         GRACE
          Stop it! What are you doing?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie
          and the coach can't help but LAUGH along with him, as we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RAMADA INN - NIGHT

          Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van. As
          Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out
          clutching a MOTORCYCLE HELMET. Rick stares at him.

                         FRED

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Chicks dig motorcycles.

          INT. RAMADA INN OLDIE'S BAR - NIGHT

          It's 80's night and a Hall & Oates cover band is PLAYING
          complete with look-alikes, except Oates is black. Behind the
          band there's a banner that reads: 'Ramada Inn proudly
          welcomes the Mutual of Omaha Leadership Council!' We see
          middle-aged CORPORATE TYPES everywhere.

                         DARRYL HALL

                         (SINGING)
          ". .Oh-oh here she comes, watch out
          boy she'll chew you up. Oh-oh here
          she comes, she's a maneater..."
          ANGLE ON THE BAR where Rick and Fred are checking out the
          scene. Fred is WEARING THE HELMET. (It's a huge BLACK,
          OVERSIZED HELMET WITH A VISOR.) He pulls it off, SHAKES OUT
          HIS HAIR, and places it prominently ON THE BAR.

                         FRED
          Jackpot, baby.
          Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S..

                         RICK
          How about those two?
          ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table.

                         FRED
          Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes.
          Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands
          it to Rick.

                         RICK
          What's this?

                         FRED
          I went on-line this afternoon and
          wrote down some good pick-up lines
          to break the ice.

                         RICK

                         (READING)
          'Hi. Will you help me find my
          puppy? I think he ran into the
          cheap hotel across the street.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         FRED
          That's a good one--except for one
          thing: We don't have a puppy, so
          when she gets there she'll realize
          we're full of shit.
          Rick shoots him a look.

                         RICK
          I don't think it's supposed to be
          for real. It's just to make her
          laugh so she'll talk to you.
          Fred considers this.

                         FRED
          Oh God no, it doesn't work on that
          level. Here, this is my favorite.
          He takes the paper from Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (READING)
          'You must be from Ireland because
          when I look at you my penis is
          Dublin.'

                         RICK
          It's a charmer but you know what?
          We don't need phony pick-up lines.
          Why don't we just be ourselves?

                         FRED
          Great. If you know how to.
          Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.

                         RICK
          Give me the helmet.
          Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two
          Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on
          his heels.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hi.
          The women give him a pleasant look.

                         LATINO WOMAN #1
          Hello.
          Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick.

                         FRED
          Hola.
          LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then:

                         RICK
          Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like
          I'm back at my first junior high
          school mixer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          Rick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another
          LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT. Rick clears his throat.

                         RICK CONT'D)
          So...are you ladies from Ireland?

                         LATINO WOMAN #2
          No.

          RICK.
          I'm very surprised to hear that
          news, because when I look at you my
          penis doubles in size.
          The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in.

                         FRED
          No, he means his dick is Dublin.
          Like the city. In Ireland.
          As the girls turn away from them, we begin a...
          MUSIC MONTAGE - Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That plays as
          our GUYS GET SHOT DOWN by a DOZEN DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

                         END MONTAGE

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Rick and Fred are at the bar looking TIRED and FRUSTRATED.

                         RICK
          I have this overwhelming urge to
          donkey-kick everyone in this bar.

                         FRED
          Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no
          one said this was going to be easy.
          Even in college you had to take
          fifty rejections for every score,
          remember?

                         RICK
          Yeah, but it didn't sting so much
          when I was drunk.
          Fred perks up.

                         FRED
          That's it! We should be drinking!

                         RICK
          You're right. We're too stiff.

                         FRED
          Way too stiff. We gotta start
          pounding 'em, get those creative
          juices flowing, bring the soul to
          the surface.
          Rick smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         RICK
          That's when we're at our most
          charming!

          SMASH CUT TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A HAMMERED Fred is HOLDING A HAND OVER ONE EYE as he SHOUTS
          at a table full of GORGEOUS YOUNG WOMEN.

                         FRED
          You say no to me? You say no to
          me?! I SAY NO TO YOU!
          He's being restrained by an unusually patient BOUNCER. In
          the b.g. we see Rick PASSED OUT ON A STOOL in a VERY AWKWARD

          POSITION.

                         BOUNCER
          Come on, buddy, let's go...
          The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little
          amusement.

                         FRED
          No, screw them!
          (pointing at the women)
          You think your shit don't stink?!
          Well I got news for ya: I wouldn't
          titty-bang you in a snow storm!

                         20-SOMETHING WOMAN
          (mocking),
          Oh, please, sir, please titty-bang
          us in a snow storm!
          The women LAUGH.

                         FRED
          Nope, you blew it, not gonna
          happen.

                         BOUNCER
          (still restraining Fred)
          There you go, mister, you got 'em
          good. Now let's go.
          As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a STUNNING GIRL
          passes them WEARING TIGHT LEATHER PANTS with an AMERICAN FLAG
          PRINT ON THE BUTT. Fred turns to her.

                         FRED

                         (SLURRING)
          Hey, sweetie, you need a pole for
          that flag?
          Just then, the Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND appears, and as his
          FIST MEETS FRED'S FACE, we

          A SNORING Rick is FAST ASLEEP, sprawled out on his back on
          the bed WEARING ONLY HIS BOXERS despite the clock next to him
          reading 3:37 in the afternoon. He's surrounded by several
          left-over ROOM SERVICE TRAYS.

          INT. COLDWELL BANKER OFFICE - SAME

          A worn-out-looking Rick is working at his desk when Fred
          approaches (with a BLACK EYE.)

                         FRED
          I know what we've been doing wrong.
          Rick lifts his chin.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          If we're gonna break out of this
          slump, we've got to start using our
          strength. And that is.. .people who
          know us, like us. So we should go
          after the women we've already won
          over.

                         RICK
          You mean like our wives?

                         FRED
          Yeah, like that, but not them.
          Fred sits in the chair across from Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          I was thinking Coffee Girl.

                         RICK
          You've won over Coffee Girl?

                         FRED
          Well, I'm sure she'd recognize me.
          Rick thinks about this.

                         RICK
          Look, if you really want to go
          after someone you already know,
          have you considered Missy
          Frankenfield?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          Fred's listening.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
           She's got all the stats you like--
          she's beautiful, you k now her phone n ow-
           number, she's freshly divorced...

                         FRED
          Which according to Hog-head means
          she's horny.

                         RICK
          Bingo.

          they hear O.S. YELLING and lookupto see the baseball player
          Gerry WATERSKIING toward them.Helets go of the rope and

                         GERRY
          What's up, beach bunnies?
          Grace and Maggie sit up and smile.

                         GRACE
          What are you doing here?
          He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY

          Gerry, stop it!

                         GERRY
          Hey, where are the kiddies? We
          thought we'd take you all for a
          boat ride.

                         MAGGIE
          My parents took them to Martha's
          Vineyard for the weekend.
          Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat
          pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and
          a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves.

          INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          Rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in
          slacks and a Harvard t-shirt. Music plays. He peers ahead
          and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a
          TEENAGE GIRL. At the other register, Coffee Girl is also
          taking orders. Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe
          gets to him first.

                         WANNABE
          Can I take your order?
          Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the
          Wannabe.

                         RICK
          Uh...I don't know what I want.
          Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few
          moments, then levels with the guy.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Look, man, I want her to take my
          order.

                         WANNABE
          Why?

                         RICK
          Uh, she knows how I like it.

                         WANNABE

                         (ATTITUDE)
          Little help, Leigh--your unique
          barista skills have been requested.
          Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches,
          Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking.

                         LEIGH
          Hi. What would you like?
          Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is
          crowding them.

                         RICK
          Iced coffee. With two Splendas.
          Leigh rings him up.

                         LEIGH
          That'll be two dollars.
          Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers.

                         RICK
          By the way, nice tunes. Do you
          choose 'em or do they come down
          from corporate?

                         LEIGH
          Me. It's Snow Patrol.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar.

                         RICK
          Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid
          movie, too.
          Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH.

                         WANNABE
          Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s--
          the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This
          is Snow Patrol, the band.
          Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed.

                         LEIGH
          Thanks for the tip.
          As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe
          SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH.
          A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the
          coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the
          iced coffee and winks at him.

                         WANNABE
          Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced
          coffee, mister.
          Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe.
          Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back.

                         RICK
          Why are you smiling? You think this
          counter is some alligator-infested
          moat?
          Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.

          job. And it's guys like me that
          hire. And guys like me don't hire
          punks like you. So shape up.
          As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh

          HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS.

          EXT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his
          coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week
          free trial at the local gym and starts to read them.

          LEIGH (O.S.)
          I work-out there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh.

                         RICK
          You do?
          Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I work-out at home, but I was
          thinking of going public with my
          work-outs. What do you squat?
          She seems amused by this.

                         LEIGH
          I don't really squat, just run on
          the hamster-wheel everyday after
          work.
          She starts wiping down a table.

                         COFFEE GIRL
          So did you go to Harvard?
          She nods at Rick's t-shirt.

                         RICK
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          I mean, you know...I went to a
          party there once.
          Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (RE:SHIRT)
          Actually, this is Harvard Health
          Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too
          much.
          (holds up gym postcard)
          So is this a good place to join?

                         LEIGH
          Great place. Real chill. And they
          have a bar, so I always grab a beer
          after my workout.

                         RICK
          Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice
          routine. Maybe I'll routine it,
          too.

                         LEIGH
          If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent
          you--they'll give me two free
          months.

                         RICK
          I'll do that, Leigh.

                         LEIGH
          Rockin'.
          Leigh gives him the peace sign.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         RICK
          R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.
          Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we

          Fred is sitting on his bed flipping through his address book
          until he comes to Missy Frankenfield. He hits the
          SPEAKERPHONE and DIALS. Several RINGS later:

          MISSY FRANKENFIELD (V.0.)
          Hi, this is Missy. Sorry I missed
          your call. I'm out of town for a
          few days, and I may have limited
          cell reception. Please leave a
          message and I'll get back to you as
          soon as I can. BEEP.
          Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver.

                         FRED
          Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing.
          I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a
          ring and, um...well, give me a call
          when you get back. It's kind of an
          emergency. Well, not life-
          threatening, but--
          The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits
          there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STRIP MALL - LATE AFTERNOON

          TIGHT ON FRED - he's wearing SHADES and has a BASEBALL CAP
          pulled down over his eyes.
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As
          he approaches the massage parlor entrance, a bunch of LADIES
          walk out of the TRAVEL AGENCY just to the right so Fred veers
          into the DRY CLEANERS to the left.

          INT. DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

          Fred ENTERS and immediately bumps into Kimmy Long (Ed's wife)
          standing in line behind several other WOMEN. She is
          accompanied by her 7-year-old daughter and neither of them
          look happy to see him.

                         FRED
          Oh, hi.
          Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred
          nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he
          waits for the sidewalk to clear.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Um, I don't think I got a chance to
          tell you how impressed I was with
          your new place. Absolutely elegant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Kimmy GRUNTS a thank you and turns away from him.
          ANGLE ON the KOREAN LADY who owns the dry cleaners. She
          stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her.

          DRY CLEAN KOREAN LADY
          Mr. Searing, you pick up last week--
          no more clothes here!
          Fred smiles uncomfortably at Kimmy.

                         FRED
          That's right...
          (looks at watch)
          Well, gotta get going--I have a
          meeting across town in ten minutes.
          See ya.
          Fred EXITS.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

          Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is
          clear, then DUCKS INTO THE MASSAGE PARLOR.

          INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

          A YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN is behind the counter.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          You want massage?
          Fred looks around. There's an OLD KOREAN LADY sitting on a
          couch. He looks at the Young Korean Woman and nods.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You fill out.
          The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form. Fred puts it down
          and covertly moves in.

                         FRED
          I'd prefer no paper trail.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Need for insurance company.

                         FRED
          I don't think my insurance
          company's gonna cover this one.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Ten dollar co-pay?

                         FRED
          Uh, no.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Fill out form. It policy.
          Fred moves in closer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRED
          Look, I don't really want this in
          print.
          The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          How I know what you want if you no
          fill out form?

                         FRED
          Um, couldn't I just tell you?
          She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          So, what you waiting for?!
          Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then WHISPERS in
          the Young Korean Woman's ear. She nods and looks at him.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Okay.. .but must see I.D. first.
          Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill.

                         FRED
          How about a C-note so I don't have
          to fill out any forms or show any
          I.D.'s?
          The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then
          SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING...
          THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady
          looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and

          ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN LINE.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with
          tea-bag happy ending but don't fill
          out form!
          Kimmy Long glares at him, appalled. As Fred backpedals OUT
          OF THE MASSAGE PARLOR, he waves at her weakly, and we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARTY BOAT - DAY

          One hundred GUESTS dance on the top deck of this large ship
          as the Bee Gee's Night Fever BLASTS from the speakers.

                         SONG
          .Night fever, night fever.. .we
          know how to do it...'
          As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick
          Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS.
          They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are
          thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting
          tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her
          own on a dance floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as
          Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless
          wives, we

                         CUT TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat
          taking a breather.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Wow. You can really move out there.
          Maggie shrugs modestly.

                         MAGGIE
          Thanks. I was a dance major in
          college.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Really? I always wondered--what do
          you do with a degree in dance?

                         MAGGIE
          Well, as it turned out, nothing.

                         (BLUSHING)
          I guess the original plan was to go
          to New York and try to hook-up with
          one of the big dance companies, but
          then I got married and. . .your
          priorities change.
          She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Anyway, that was fun. I haven't
          danced this much in a long time.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Why not?

                         MAGGIE
          I don't know, you get busy, kids,
          school, there's so much going on.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well you gotta make time for the
          stuff you love or you'll forget who
          you are.
          Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-
          contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks
          away.

                         MAGGIE
          You know, my husband's name is
          Rick.
          Rick smiles at this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well that makes me the perfect guy
          to have an affair with--you'd never
          have to worry about screaming out
          the wrong name during sex.
          Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding.

                         MAGGIE
          I know.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Now come on, let's go find Grace
          and get something to eat. I'm
          starving.
          As they head back to the party, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK'S TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH
          CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the
          entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the
          window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's
          poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick
          rolls down the window.

                         FLATS
          Hey, Rick.

                         RICK

                         (STARTLED)
          Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing,
          man?

                         FLATS
          Great. What's up with you? How's
          that hall pass thing going?
          Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.

                         RICK
          Who told you about that--was it Hog-
          head?

                         FLATS
          No. Some old lady was yakking about
          it down at the post office.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         FLATS (CONT'D)

                         (BIG SMILE)
          So what's the deal--you getting
          laid?

                         RICK

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          What? No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I don't know where you're getting
          your information, Flats, but a hall
          pass isn't just about getting laid,
          it's about getting a week off from
          marriage to do as you please--
          whether that be fishing, or
          watching TV, whatever it is that
          relaxes you.

                         FLATS

                         (DUBIOUS)
          Oh, I didn't know that.
          Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)
          walking down the sidewalk toward the gym.

                         RICK
          Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late
          for my work-out appointment.
          When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym
          shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then
          grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS
          WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey, girl!

                         LEIGH

                         (SMILING)
          All right! You decided to go for
          it.
          As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS

                         OUT:

                         FLATS
          Hey, Rick! Good luck with the
          fishing!
          As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the
          building.

          INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude,
          CLYDE, looks up from folding towels.

                         LEIGH
          Clyde, this is my friend, uh...

                         RICK
          Rick.

                         LEIGH
          He's looking to join.

                         CLYDE
          Great. I'll get you signed up.
          Leigh pats Rick's hand.

                         LEIGH
          See ya.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          She turns to leave.

                         RICK
          So, uh, are you gonna grab a
          brewski after your work-out?

                         LEIGH
          Nah.
          Rick looks disappointed.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna grab two.
          Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives
          him the peace sign. He returns it.

                         RICK
          Peace it!
          As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.

                         CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has
          worked up a PRETTY GOOD SWEAT.
          PULL BACK to reveal that he's SITTING ON THE TOILET.

          INT. HEALTH CLUB - MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

          We hear a FLUSH. Rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a
          sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-
          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly
          turns to look.
          RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,
          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,
          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.
          As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself.

                         RICK
          What's that about--you swimming the
          English Channel?
          The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.

                         METROSEXUAL
          Nah, Just not into looking like the
          knuckle-dragging guy on the
          evolution-of-man chart.
          Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered
          body, we go...

          INT. HOT TUB ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Rick ENTERS the empty hot tub room, takes off his towel, and
          eases into the STEAMING WATER. He hits a button and the jets
          kick on FULL BLAST, turning the hot tub into a BUBBLY

          CAULDRON.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RICK
          Oh...yes.
          He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then
          settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head
          is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY. He dips beneath
          the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH, he wakes up.
          Rick takes a moment to get his bearings, then STRUGGLES to
          get out of the hot tub. But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO JELLY.

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Little help...
          When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the
          flabby, middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Help ...me...
          Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked
          metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue. They
          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for
          air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's
          head onto his NAKED LAP.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1
          Are you having chest pains, sir?

                         RICK

                         (WINDED)
          No, no, I think I was...in the hot
          tub too long. I can't feel my body.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2
          How long were you in there?

                         RICK
          What time is it?

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2
          Seven-thirty.

                         RICK
          About three hours.
          That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE
          GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1

          HOLDS HIM TIGHT.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1
          Try not to move, sir.

                         RICK
          I'm okay, just help me up.

                         (TO METROSEXUAL #2)
          All right, give him a hand.
          Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull
          him up. As Rick starts to rise, HIS FACE COMES PERILOUSLY
          CLOSE TO THE SECOND MAN'S O.S. DANGLING COCK and Rick has to

          TURN HIS HEAD TO AVOID CONTACT.
          They finally get Rick to his feet. As the naked men help him
          across the room, we
          ANGLE ON - two TANNED, HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking
          Rick's HIRSUTE BUTT.

                         RICK
          Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it
          from here.
          The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps
          before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT

          OF STEPS.

                         DAY 6

          INT. RICK AND FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          A depressed Rick and Fred sit in bed numbing their pain by
          WATCHING THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and eating a couple PINTS OF

          BEN AND JERRY'S ICE CREAM.

                         FRED
          We let down the male species.

                         (SIGHS)
          I really thought our hall passes
          might change the philosophy of
          marriage in America.
          Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (WITH MOUTH-FULL)
          I envisioned a national holiday,
          right between July 4th and Labor
          Day, like the first Friday in
          August, Hall Pass Day; a day for
          husbands to get some strange, a day
          that would forever be known as the
          holiday,that saved the institution
          of marriage.

                         RICK
          All right, don't give up.

                         FRED
          I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts-
          -this is our last day and we got
          nothing cooking. Maybe you were
          right. Maybe we should just tell
          the girls to come home.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         RICK
          No. I want the hall pass.
          Fred looks at Rick, surprised.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          At first I wasn't sure, but now I
          want the dream.

                         FRED
          I'm not even sure I know what the
          dream is anymore.

                         RICK
          I just...I just want to know what
          it's like to be with another woman.

                         FRED
          Well, just pull up one of the
          golden oldies in your spank bank--
          it's almost like being there.

                         RICK
          I don't have anything in that spank
          bank.

                         FRED
          I'm talking about all the girls
          before you met Maggie.
          Rick doesn't say anything.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          What?

                         (BEAT)
          No, you're not serious?
          Rick lowers his head.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Wait a second, are you saying...?

                         (BEAT)
          But how can that be--you didn't
          meet Maggie until college?

                         RICK

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Yeah, so? What do you think,
          everyone gets laid in high school?
          I got news for you, mister--getting
          laid in high school is not a right,
          it's a privilege.
          Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          First class, first day, freshman
          year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting
          three seats away in Western Civ--
          and I fell in love instantly. I
          begged her for three months to go
          out with me, she finally caved, and
          that night I told her I loved her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Eighty-four days later she told me
          she loved me back and we've been
          together ever since.
          Fred stares at him.

                         FRED
          Wow. That's a really creepy story.
          Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Hello.

                         (BEAT)
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          Oh, okay, great.
          Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything.

                         RICK
          Who was that?

                         FRED
          Just an angel from heaven.
          Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
           Coakley's back in town!

          BOUQUET OF FLOWERS and an open GIFT BOX displaying an

          ENGRAVED I.D. BRACELET.

                         MAGGIE
          Does this mean you're going steady?

                         GRACE

                         (GUILTY)
          That's not funny. I feel terrible--
          the poor kid's spending all his
          hard-earned money on me--that's
          sad. Cute, but sad.

                         MAGGIE
          Grace, you should be flattered.
          You're thirty-eight-years-old and
          college kids are still swooning
          over you.

                         GRACE
          Well I just feel bad if I gave him
          the wrong impression.

          flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love

          Maggie picks up a card.

          Fred texts someone.

                         RICK
          What are you doing?

          Just texting Missy Frankenfield
          that we're going to be at Enter the
          Dragon--I'm covering all my bases.

                         RICK
          You don't need Missy Frankenfield
          tonight. If we can't get the job
          done with Coakley as our wingman,
          then we're pathetic.
          Just then, Fred NOTICES something O.S.

          CLOSE ON RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - a suave, DEBONAIR MAN (played

          Rick and Fred jump up and approach him WITH OPEN ARMS but at
          the last second Clooney steps aside REVEALING a THIN, BALDING
          MAN dressed HEAD-TO-TOE IN MOTORCYCLE LEATHERS (think Larry
          David.)

          Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in.
          S'been rough sledding, huh?

          I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.

                         FRED
          For what?
          Coakley shoots him a look.

                         COAKLEY
          If you're really serious about
          this, stop questioning me.
          The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE
          DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently
          across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK
          BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD.

          Okay, guys, you tried it your way
          and you railed miserably. You

          Rick and Fred are visibly deflated.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Guys, you're not trying to get
          married here--you're trying to get
          laid.

                         RICK
          Aren't you the guy who goes to the
          Hawaiian Tropic finals every year?
          Is that for the ugly girls?

                         COAKLEY
          I go to the Tropic finals because
          Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and
          she's gonna need a hug. And quite
          often you can parlay a hug into a
          hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us
          two bottles of Moet and six
          glasses.
          Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum
          of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender
          but can't get anyone's attention.

          PAIGE (O.S.)
          Hi, Mr. Mills.
          Rick turns to see that he's crammed in beside his babysitter
          Paige who's looking a LITTLE TIPSY.

          I'm legal now.

          Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out
          celebrating?

                         PAIGE
          Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg.
          Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,
          early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          She's the best. Forty-two years old
          but she still parties like she's my
          age.

          Nice.
          Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.

                         PAIGE
          So, Rick, how's the hall pass
          going?
          Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          You don't mind if I call you Rick,

          No, of course not--what did you
          just say?

                         PAIGE
          I was asking about your hall pass.
          (off Rick's look)
          I baby-sit for the Putneys and I
          heard Gary talking about it the
          other night at their barbecue.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         RICK
          He was talking about it at a
          barbecue?!

                         PAIGE
          Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad
          way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         85

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          In fact, I thought it was very
          classy of you to be staying at the
          Holiday Inn Express instead of
          bringing girls back to your home
          with all the kids' pictures and
          schoolwork taped up everywhere.
          Rick forces a smile.

                         RICK
          Thank you.
          A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and
          six glasses please.
          Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.

                         PAIGE
          So does it work both ways?

                         RICK
          What?

                         PAIGE
          The hall pass. Does your wife get
          one, too.

                         RICK

                         (AMUSED)
          Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men
          only.

                         PAIGE
          Oh. Who made that rule?

                         RICK
          Well ...um...
          As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.

                         PAIGE
          By the way, I kind of owe you an
          apology.
          (lowers her voice,

                         BASH
          Last week ful) when you drove me home, I
           shouldn't have snapped at you like
          that.

                         RICK
          Oh, don't worry about it. It was a
          big misunderstanding.

                         PAIGE
          No, it wasn't.
          She takes a moment, looks around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          If you thought I was coming on to
          you that night, it's because...I
          was.
          Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with
          the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
          pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
          with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.

                         RICK
          Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but
          it was great seeing you.
          Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly
          annoyed.

                         PAIGE
          Are you serious? You're doing this
          again... even with a hall pass?

                         RICK
          Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.
          Have a happy birthday.
          As Rick walks away, we go
          BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.

                         COAKLEY
          Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.

                         FRED
          Holy crap... look who's here.
          The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past
          with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP.

                         LEIGH
          Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday--
          I thought we were gonna grab a
          beer?
          Fred looks at Rick, confused.

                         RICK

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Yeah, I got a little caught up in
          my curls and reps and shit.

                         (CHANGING SUBJECT)
          So is this your playground?

                         LEIGH
          Nah, I've never been here, but a
          friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so
          I promised him I'd come.
          Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives
          Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones
          hanging around his neck.

                         WANNABE
          Wassup, girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Wannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile.

                         WANNABE (CONT'D)
          Oh. Hey. What are you doing here--
          you auditing the place?

                         RICK
          Actually, I work for Sirius XM
          Radio--we're looking to hire some
          new deejays so I'm checking out all
          the clubs.
          Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.

                         WANNABE
          Oh. Cool. Are you serious?

                         RICK
          Not!
          Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the
          deflated Wannabe.

                         WANNABE

                         (ANNOYED)
          Oh, that's hip. Real fresh.
          (turns to Leigh)
          Why don't you hit the dance floor--
          the next song's gonna be for you.
          As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe
          returns to his deejay booth.

                         FRED

                         (GLARING)
          Beer? When were you two going to
          have a beer?

                         RICK

                         (GUILTY)
          No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong
          to the same gym and happened to be
          there at the same time yesterday
          afternoon.

                         FRED
          What gym do you belong to and where
          the hell was I?

                         COAKLEY
          Well, according to Kimmy Long, you
          were at the massage parlor trying
          to get a rub-and-tug without
          filling out the paperwork.
          This takes the wind out of Fred's sails.

                         RICK
          What?
          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I thought the massage parlor was
          admitting defeat?

                         FRED
          I had a knot in my neck--why the
          hell didn't you tell me you saw
          Coffee Girl?!

                         COAKLEY
          Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all
          here for the same thing. And I'll
          give you a hint what that thing is:
          It begins with a 'P' and ends with
          an 'ussy.'
          Coakley puts his arm around Fred.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna
          get taken care ot.
          (looks out at crowd)
          We Just gotta find you a gazelle
          with a bad wheel.

                         FRED
          Huh?
          Coakley spots something.

                         COAKLEY
          Ooh--there's a couple of
          trainwrecks. Let's go.

                         FRED

                         (ALARMED)
          Whoa--wait a second.
          But Coakley steers Fred over to two CHUBBY, NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE
          BLONDES laying on a 'bed' in the corner.

                         COAKLEY
          Ladies, this is my friend Fred
          Pinkberry--his yogurt company just
          went public and he's out
          celebrating. He'd like to offer you
          a flute of champagne.
          The Chubby Blondes PERK UP.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #1
          I love Pinkberry!
          As the girls make room for a reluctant Fred, we go...
          BACK ACROSS THE ROOM where we see Rick watching Leigh and her
          hot girlfriends DANCE. Leigh catches Rick staring. He
          smiles and clumsily shoots her the PEACE SIGN. Finally, he
          takes a deep breath and DANCES HIS WAY UP NEXT TO HER.

                         RICK
          So.. .having a good time?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         LEIGH
          Chillin'.

                         RICK
          Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'.
          LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I haven't been ancing in a long
          time.

                         LEIGH

                         (TEASING)
          I can tell.

                         RICK
          Oh yeah? Just try to keep up.
          She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and

          PULLS HIM ASIDE.

                         COAKLEY
          Abort! Abort! You stand not a
          chance.

                         RICK
          No, no, I think we're starting to
          gel.
          Coakley rolls his eyes.

                         COAKLEY
          No, no, you're mistaken. Look,
          dude, this ain't Operation Cock-
          block here--now trust me, retreat.
          Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic.

                         RICK
          Coak, I'm never gonna have another
          hall pass, so this memory has to
          last a lifetime. . .you know what I
          mean?
          Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS.

                         COAKLEY
          All right, I'll be at the bar when
          this thing blows up in your face.
          As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we...
          PAN ACROSS THE ROOM to the PISSED-OFF Wannabe watching them
          from the deejay booth.

                         WANNABE

                         (INTO MIC)
          All right, 'all, adult-swim's
          over. Now if you was born before
          1980 you're gonna want to step off
          the floor 'cause we're about to
          kick it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          ON RICK - he looks over at Wannabe but CONTINUES TO DANCE.

                         RICK
          Is this guy your boyfriend or
          something?

                         LEIGH
          No, no, no.
          She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          One time we messed around a little.

                         RICK
          And what does 'messed around a
          little' mean these days?

                         LEIGH
          Anal.
          Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. He kissed me one night
          and I kissed back--I shouldn't
          have.

          WANNABE (O.S.)
          Seriously, you grandpappies better
          get off the floor before someone
          falls and breaks a hip!
          Rick points at Wannabe.

                         RICK

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Just play your funky music, white
          boy!
           As the music shifts gears and becomes FASTER and LOUDER, we

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Maggie's at the sink cleaning up when she NOTICES that the
           ANSWERING MACHINE LIGHT IS BLINKING. She dries her hands,
          then pushes the button.

           HISPANIC WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
           (on answering machine)
          Hola, Maggie, this is Isabel. I
          went to clean the house today but
          nobody has been there or slept in
          any of the beds this week, so I
          just cleaned the windows and left
          early. I hope you don't mind.
          CLOSE ON a concerned-looking Maggie. She moves to the
          window, stares at the lights on the ocean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Maggie turns to see Rick Coleman standing out on her front
          porch.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh. Hey.
          She goes to the screen door.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Thought you might want to help me
          celebrate the end of the season.
          He holds up a grocery bag.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          I got some good late-night eats.
          Maggie hesitates a moment. Then she opens the door and lets
          him in.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

          A bored-looking Fred is smooshed between the Chubby Blondes
          on the bed.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #1
          It was the greys--you know, the
          tall, skinny aliens--and they were
          all over my yard, but--and here's
          the weird thing--I wasn't at all
          afraid of them so when they asked
          me if I wanted to get in their
          spaceship, I said, 'Sure,' and I
          walked right on.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #2
          Oh my God, you're so brave! I would
          never, ever in a million years
          climb into one of those things.
          Fred, would you ever just walk into
          a UFO on your own?

                         FRED

                         (DEADPAN)
          If they came right now I would,
          sure.

          MISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.)
          There you are!
          Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching.

                         FRED
          Oh my god! You're here!
          Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         92

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Franken-berry, how the heck are
          ya?!
          She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You look incredible!

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD

                         (CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Thanks, Fred, you look good, too.

                         FRED
          Never felt better.
          Missy nods.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I have to say, I can't believe I'm
          actually here--I was on my way home
          from dinner when I noticed your
          text. So what's this big emergency?

                         FRED
          Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I
          just meant that there's some
          important stuff I want to talk to
          you about. You know, one on one, me
          and you--without all the husbands
          and wives and hoopla. So how are
          you?

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I'm... good.

                         FRED
          No, I mean how-are-you. Inside.
          What's happenin' in there? There
          must be all sorts of emotions
          churning up with the divorce and
          everything.
          She gives him a long look.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Maybe we should go somewhere else--
          this doesn't seem like the best
          place to spill one's guts.
          Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside.

                         COAKLEY

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          What part of 'go ugly early' didn't
          you understand? You've got a better
          chance of winning husband-of-the-
          year than tagging that chiquita.
          Fred flinches at this.

                         FRED
          But...I know her. She said she
          wants to leave with me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         COAKLEY
          Then she's insane--run for the
          hills.

                         FRED
          Coak, the woman's going through a
          divorce. She's not insane, she's
          just making really poor decisions
          right now.
          (hands him his car keys)
          Here, give Rick the keys to my mini-
          van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel
          with Missy.
          Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.

                         COAKLEY
          It's your funeral, princess.
          BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF
          BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his
          hair is dripping wet.

                         LEIGH
          Are you okay--you keep checking
          your pulse?

                         RICK
          Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest
          cramp during the last song, but I
          worked through it.
          She smiles at this.

                         LEIGH
          Come on, let's sit this one out. I
          need a breather.
          They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a
          stack of cocktail napkins.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          So what's up with the ring?
          He looks at his finger, then back at her.

                         RICK
          Um...have you ever heard of a hall
          pass?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

          Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC
          coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking
          nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry
          appears in the doorway.

                         GERRY
          There she is! Come on in, I'm
          mixing up some margaronis. We lost
          our final game, but I got four
          hits!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         GRACE
          Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?

                         GERRY
          They all went out to party--now get
          in here!
          But Grace stays on the porch.

                         GRACE
          Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.

                         GERRY
          What?
          Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it
          shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          Is everything okay?

                         GRACE
          Yeah, yeah, everything's fine,
          but...
          (holds up gift box)
          .I can't accept this.

                         GERRY
          Why not?
          Grace does a double-take.

                         GRACE
          Gerry, I'm a married woman.
          Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the
          box and he reluctantly accepts it.

                         GERRY
          Um... I'm sorry if I made you
          uncomfortable, Grace. It's just
          that...I really like you.

                         GRACE
          I like you, too, Gerry, and you
          didn't make me uncomfortable.
          She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's
          some serious eye-contact, and then BAM!
          They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S
          NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they
          STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we

          Rick and Leigh are leaning against the bar.

                         LEIGH
          So...you're married?

                         RICK
          I wasn't deliberately hiding it.
          He holds up his ring hand.

                         LEIGH
          Yeah, I just thought your wife had
          died or something and you were
          wearing it out of respect.

                         RICK

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Uh, nope. She's still hangin' in
          there.
          Just then, Coakley PULLS RICK ASIDE.

                         COAKLEY
          Come on, you're not gonna close the
          sale here--let's move this clambake
          back to my place.

                         RICK
          Okay, but what am I gonna do there?

                         COAKLEY
          What do you mean, what are you
          gonna do? I've got a house with
          bedrooms--do the math. When it
          doesn't work out with her--which it
          won't--there's going to be a bunch
          of other back-up chicks there.
          Rick nods then turns to Leigh.

                         RICK
          My buddy's inviting everybody back
          to his crib.

          INT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Fred and Missy are walking down the hallway toward his room.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I've got to be honest, Fred... I'm
          not really sure what we're doing
          here.

                         FRED
          What do you mean? We're hangin',
          we're connecting--that's what
          friends do. Especially if they want
          to take it to the next level where
          they can call each other 'good
          friends.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          He comes to his room and starts to unlock the door.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          You're married, Fred.

                         FRED
          Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
          Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          What does blah-blah mean? You are
          still married, right?

                         FRED
          Happily. Look, I don't want to get
          into all the details, but my wife
          gave me this one-time deal where I
          get to be with another woman.
          He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I thought we were going to the
          hotel bar?

                         FRED
          We are. There's a mini-bar in my
          room. You better hurry up, it's
          last call.
          Fred smiles.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Are you out of your flippin' mind?
          Fred loses the smile.

                         FRED
          Um...

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Are you out of your mind?!

                         FRED
          I'm going to be honest with you--
          your tone right now is scaring me.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          You call me up for the first time
          in your life, claim you have some
          kind of emergency, and it turns out
          that you just want to screw me?!

                         FRED
          Or not.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Well, screw you, Fred!
          She starts walking down the hallway. Fred nods, unfazed.

          Nail on the head!
          She turns and glares at him.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          What?

                         FRED
          What you just said--I had that
          coming. Big time.
          Fred hangs his head.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)
          Seriously, Missy, I...I don't know
          what's gotten into me this week. I
          think I must be having some kind of
          mid-life crisis or something
          because I've been acting like a
          real jackass.

                         (SIGHS
          Anyway ease forgive me. I
          really am very, very sorry and
          ashamed.
          Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Okay. Whatever.

                         FRED

          He arches an eyebrow.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Fuck you, Fred!
          Missy STORMS away.

                         (TO SELF )
          'No thank you' would have sufficed.
          Fred walks into his room and closes the door.

          Fred goes to the mini-bar and pours himself a drink. He

          miserably. He sits on the bed. Alone.
          Then a KNOCK. Fred gets up and opens the door.

          Everything okay?

                         GRACE
          Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no,
          everything's not okay.

                         GERRY
          What?
          He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.

                         GRACE
          Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry,
          and you're very charming and very
          sweet and the last thing I wanted
          to do was hurt your feelings,
          but...well, what,just happened can
          never happen again.
          Gerry looks confused.

          husband.

                         GERRY
          So? What does that have to do with
          anything? Fate threw us together

          Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of
          his words.

          Not always.

          It wasn't fair to my husband... and

          She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out
          a LAUGH.

                         GERRY
          I know that.

                         GRACE
          You do?

                         GERRY

                         (BIG SMILE)
          Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no
          offense, but let's face it, you're
          a lot older than me.
          She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check
          for Grace.

                         GRACE
          Right.

                         GERRY
          I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm
          just saying, I didn't think we were
          going to start dating, you know?
          Could you imagine the looks we'd
          get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and
          his girlfriends--except in reverse.
          Gerry CHUCKLES.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          You'd be Hugh Hefner.

                         GRACE
          Yeah, I got that part.
          Gerry looks at his watch.

                         GERRY
          Ooh, I gotta get going. We have
          kind of a team meeting in like
          twenty minutes.
          Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.

                         GERRY CONT'D
          It's, uh, kind o a tradition that
          we always get together on the night
          of the last game. It would probably
          be uncool if I missed it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         GRACE
          You don't have to explain.

                         GERRY
          Seriously, though, thanks for
          everything--that was awesome.
          He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then
          Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a
          moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START
          OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood.
          We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the
          street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are
          still arriving.

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

          The place is JAMMING. It's a nice house but under-furnished
          in a bachelor pad kind of way. Rick and Leigh are in a
          corner drinking beers.

                         LEIGH
          I guess I still have a lot to get
          out of my system before I do the
          marriage trip. I'm one of those
          people who wants to try everything
          once before I die.

                         RICK

                         (BLURTING OUT)
          Have you ever been with a married
          guy?
          Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch.

                         LEIGH
          No.

                         RICK
          Neither have I.
          Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of
          truth.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'd like to help you take being
          with a married guy off your list of
          things to do before you die.

                         LEIGH
          You would?

                         RICK
          Yes.
          Leigh gets close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         LEIGH
          I don't want to be a home-wrecker.

                         RICK
          I've got a one-time pass, remember?

                         LEIGH
          That wasn't just a line?

                         RICK
          No. It's for real.
          Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his
          hand.

                         LEIGH
          So where can we go to talk some
          more about this?

                         RICK

                         (NERVOUS)
          Um, Coakley has a game room
          upstairs. We could.. .talk there.

          WANNABE (O.S.)
          Leigh!
          Rick and Leigh look over to see an AGITATED Wannabe forcing
          his way through the crowd.

                         WANNABE (CONT'D)
          Where have you...? Why didn't
          you...? You knew this was my big
          night! How could you just--?
          (turns away, emotional)
          Look, can I please talk to you in
          private? Now.
          Leigh looks apologetically at Rick.

                         LEIGH
          Can you give me a second?

                         RICK
          Sure.
          Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them
          have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may even
          be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when
          he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh.

                         WANNABE
          Well? Are you coming?
          Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick.

                         LEIGH
          I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal
          with this.
          Rick can't believe what's happening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         RICK
          Really? Now? I thought you said he
          wasn't your boyfriend.

                         LEIGH
          He's not...but he is a friend.
          Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at
          the door, then turns back to Rick.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.
          Before Rick can stop her, Leigh LEAVES THE PARTY with
          Wannabe. After a LONG BEAT, Rick slides down into a chair,

          DEVASTATED.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEACH COTTAGE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Maggie is spilling her guts to Rick Coleman as he stands over
          the stove MAKING PANCAKES.

                         MAGGIE
          .And he hasn't even spent one
          night in his own bed this week.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Let me get this straight--you gave
          him his freedom and now you're mad
          that he's acting free?
          This logic clearly stings Maggie.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Hey, I'm sure there's an
          explanation. Maybe he took a trip
          somewhere?

                         MAGGIE
          I called his assistant--he's been
          in the office almost everyday.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Look, Maggie, for all you know your
          husband's been working at a sou
          kitchen, sleeping in his car al
          week, and he's only gotten laid two
          or three times at most.
          She looks up and forces a smile.

                         MAGGIE
          Ha-ha.
          Maggie checks her watch.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Jeez, I wonder what's taking Grace
          so long?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well, if she went over to break the
          kid's heart, the least she could do
          is lend a sympathetic ear.
          He flips a pancake onto a plate.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Prepare yourself for heaven.
          She reaches for the plate, but he slaps her hand away.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Not so fast, lady. I'm not
          finished. You have not lived until
          you've had my steaming hot
          blueberry pancakes...
          He pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          .A la mode.
          Maggie smiles.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh My-lanta.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          And to wash it all down...
          Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off
          Maggie's smile, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          A glum Rick is walking through the PACKED PARTY when he bumps
          into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROUP OF

          GUYS.

                         RICK
          Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?

                         HOG-HEAD
          We're here for the hall pass.

                         RICK
          Really? I thought you guys had
          given up on us?

                         BAKER
          We did. We're here with them.
          He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's
          and paunchy.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         BAKER
          When Leary and Boshane heard about
          your guy's hall pass, they
          convinced their wives to give them
          one, too.
          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.

                         RICK
          You weren't supposed to tell anyone
          about the hall pass!

                         LEARY
          They didn't say anything. Our wives
          heard about it at the pool.

                         RICK
          No! At the pool?!
          Rick rubs his face, distressed.

                         BOSHANE
          Yep. And then about three days ago--
          after some hard-core negotiating--
          we managed to push the bill
          through.
          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.

                         RICK
          Really? So...how's it going?

                         BOSHANE
          Solid. Very solid.

                         LEARY
          We're building mucho momentumo.
          Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.

                         LEARY (CONT'D)

                         (ANNOYED)
          Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just
          about sex, you know.

                         BOSHANE
          That's right. It's about going
          bowling and, uh, staying up late,
          and being able to do what you want
          to do when you want to do it.

                         RICK
          Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?

                         BOSHANE

                         (DISPIRITED)
          It's a lot tougher than we thought
          it would be.
          Just then Gary comes around a corner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         GARY
          Hey, dudes, there's like ten very
          bangable chicks out on the back
          deck--let's go!
          Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.

                         LEARY
          To freedom!
          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he
          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH

          LEIGH.

                         LEIGH
          Hey, where are you going?

                         RICK
          What are you doing...? I thought
          you'd left.

                         LEIGH
          No. I told you, I just had to talk
          him off the ledge. I calmed him
          down and sent him on his way.

                         RICK
          Oh. Uh, great.

                         LEIGH
          So where's that game room? I
          thought we were gonna play some
          games.
          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens
          the door and flips on the light.
          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
          bar, and a bed.

                         LEIGH
          I'll be right back--I just have to
          use the bathroom.
          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.
          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door.

          COAKLEY (O.S.)
          Hey.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small
          study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap
          and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         RICK
          Hey. How come you're not downstairs
          partying?
          Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.

                         COAKLEY
          All partied out, pal.
          Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the

          TV.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Man, that Barney Fife still kills
          me.
          He looks back to Rick.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Hey, I was thinking about this hall-
          pass business. It's really ironic,
          isn't it?
          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.

                         RICK
          How's that?

                         COAKLEY
          Well think about it. There's two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives: The guy who does it behind
          her back, and a guy like you who
          has his wife's permission.

                         RICK
          Well it's not really cheating if I
          have permission.

                         COAKLEY
          Yeah, whatever. The point is, if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em
          would pick you, because you're
          being honest--there's no deceit
          involved.
          Rick is growing uncomfortable.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          But the funny thing is, the other
          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety, while his wife's running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesn't know anything. And you, the
          good guy, you've got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wife's shoulders.

                         RICK
          Well I didn't really think of it

                         LIKE--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         COAKLEY
          It's like she's your guilt Sherpa!
          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Funny, huh?

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Yeah.

                         COAKLEY
          And that, my friend, is why you are
          a genius.
          As Rick lets this all sink in, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are
          crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of
          wine and sits beside her.

                         FRED
          Cheers.
          They CLINK glasses.

                         AUNT MEG
          Rick, I hope you don't mind me
          tracking you down--Paige told me
          where you were staying.

                         FRED
          Please. Not at all.

                         AUNT MEG
          You've been very sweet to her.
          Fred waves her off.

                         FRED
          Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I
          can for the kids.
          Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.

                         AUNT MEG
          She told me everything. And I have
          to say, I was very impressed.

                         FRED
          Hm?

                         AUNT MEG
          I know she tried to hook-up with
          you--twice in fact--and that you
          set her straight both times.
          Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         FRED
          Uh...hook-up?

                         AUNT MEG

                         (SMILES)
          Rick, enough with the chivalry.
          Paige wanted to sleep with you and
          you didn't take advantage of her.
          I'm just saying that's very cool.
          He shrugs modestly.

                         FRED
          Well... she's a kid and kids get
          crushes. I remember in tenth grade
          I had the biggest crush on my
          French teacher--thank God Mr.
          LeClaire was professional enough to
          only date seniors.
          Meg GIGGLES.

                         AUNT MEG
          I'm serious, it takes a certain
          kind of guy to say no to a
          beautiful young girl like that--
          especially since you have your
          wi e's permission now.
          Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.

          AUNT MEG (CONT'D)
          I like that, Rick. You have morals.
          She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her
          breasts.

                         FRED
          Hey, all you have in this world is
          your word.
          As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we

                          CUT TO:

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - GAME ROOM - NIGHT

          Rick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leigh
          turns and smiles at Rick.

                         RICK
          Leigh, I gotta split.

                         LEIGH
          What?

                         RICK

                         (NERVOUS)
          Yeah, I kind of hit a wall.
          She can hardly believe her ears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         LEIGH
          Really? Are you feeling okay?
          You're not mad because I went
          outside with my friend, are you?

                         RICK
          No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be
          doing this. I have.. .you know,
          commitments.
          Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her
          DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him
          and she's PERFECT.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (WEAKLY)
          Um, you dropped something.
          For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart
          beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively
          leans back.

                         LEIGH
          Relax. Don't think so much. You're
          gonna have your wife for the rest
          of your life, but tonight. . .you
          have me.
          Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or
          three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never
          from a woman this beautiful.
          She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF
          HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy
          and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick
          had hoped it would, the dream.
          She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,
          her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she
          leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her,
          we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick.

                         RICK
          Nope. I can't do this.
          He reaches for his shirt.

                         LEIGH
          What are you doing?

                         RICK
          I'm sorry.
          She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.

                         LEIGH
          Your wife didn't give you a hallway
          permission slip, did she?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         RICK
          Yes, she did, but... look, you're
          insanely beautiful and
          pathologically sexy and every cell
          in my body is telling me to dust do
          this, but--
          Rick points to his chest.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          See this area, this spot right
          here? The first time Maggie and I
          slept together, back in college,
          she fell asleep right here. And she
          left a puddle of drool. And it
          didn't bother me. It actually felt
          good. That's when I knew I was
          going to marry her.

                         (BEAT)
          And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar--
          when they were babies, this is
          where they slept. Or sometimes at
          four o'clock in the morning Emma
          would just lay there and stare up
          at me. It was where we first got to
          know each other.

                         (BEAT)
          So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing
          as I think you are...I gotta go
          home.
          Rick shrugs apologetically.

                         LEIGH
          Well, I think you have a screw
          loose and you're probably going to
          regret this for the rest of your
          life, but. . .right on, man.

                         RICK
          Um...do you want me to give you a
          ride home?

                         LEIGH
          No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going
          back down to the party.
          Rick raises two fingers.

                         RICK
          Peace it.

                         LEIGH
          R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.
          As they smile at each other one last time, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FRED'S MINIVAN - NIGHT

          Rick is pulling away from Coakley's house when the car phone
          RINGS. Rick pushes a button to ANSWER.

          Hello.

          MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

                         (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
          Yes, is this Fred Searing?

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not
          here right now. I'm using his car.

          MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

                         (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
          Well, would you know where I could
          find him? This is Sgt. Polisner of
          the Massachusetts State Police.
          As Rick grows alarmed, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Fred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in
          front of him. Fred's PANTS ARE DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, leaving
          him with only his boxers on. Meg KISSES HIS CHEST and
          STOMACH, then leans back and TAKES OFF HER TANK-TOP,
          revealing EXTRA-LARGE BAZOOKAS stuffed into a slinky bra.

                         AUNT MEG
          I'm attracted to men with
          integrity.

                         FRED
          Thanks--wow, you got great jugs.
          Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his
          pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.

                         AUNT MEG
          Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh?

                         FRED

                         (SHRUGGING)
          Well, I grew up in the midwest.
          She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his
          pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him
          and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS.
          An O.S. Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach.

                         AUNT MEG
          Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you
          to make love to me.
          Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and
          Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-level on
          her.)

                         RICK
          Fred, I need to talk to you!
          Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused.

          I'm Rick.
          Fred cowers guiltily.

                         FRED
          Please don't judge me.

          EXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

          Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick
          on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his
          nose.

                         FRED
          What did they tell you? Is Grace
          gonna be okay?

                         RICK
          All I know is she was in a car
          accident and they rushed her to the
          hospital.

                         FRED
          Oh my God...
          Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and

          REACT.
          THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can
          see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN
          by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is
          spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Whoa!!! What the hell...?!
          Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face.

                         WANNABE
          How do you like me now, Splenda-
          boy?

                         FRED
          You moron, that's Lny car! His is
          the one next to it!
          Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and
          quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN
          TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF

          THE PARKING LOT.
          BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR

          BREATHS.

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back Rick and
          Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle. Fred tries his
          car phone as he drives.

                         FRED
          Oh come on! How can a hospital not
          have a live operator?!

                         RICK
          It's four in the morning, Fred.
          Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel.

                         FRED
          What was I thinking?! I had a great
          wife--a beautiful wife--and now I
          may lose her.. .because of you.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?! You
          said our wives were living their
          dreams, with their fancy gas ovens,
          and that our dream was the hall
          pass! How can you blame this on
          me?!

                         FRED
          I'd never even heard of a hall pass
          until you flaunted yours in my
          face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a
          hall pass--everyone should have a
          hall pass!' You ruined my life,

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Something's wrong here, Maggie.

                         MAGGIE
          Hm?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Something's wrong with a guy who
          would leave a woman like you alone
          for this long.

                         MAGGIE

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Well, you know...I did give him a
          hall pass.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          So what? If you were my girl, I
          wouldn't have taken it.
          An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks
          away.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          You deserve way better.

                         MAGGIE
          Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't
          really even want the hall pass. I
          kind of forced it on him.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Why would you do that?
          Maggie thinks about this.

                         MAGGIE
          I don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess I felt like he wasn't
          noticing me anymore. j guess I
          wanted to feel.. .desired again. And
          the truth is, in my heart, I never
          thought he'd go through with it.
          He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each
          other's eyes. He leans in and she does, too, and right when
          it looks like THEY MAY KISS, Maggie hesitates as suddenly

          EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR TO HER.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God...

                         RICK COLEMAN
          What?

                         MAGGIE
          This hall pass ...it wasn't for him.

                         (SOFTLY)
          It was...for me.
          And as they hang on that realization, we

          A police cruiser is parked on the highway divider.

          INT. POLICE CRUISER - SAME

          Two YOUNG COPS are relaxing with their coffees when the

          SMASHED-UP MINI-VAN FLIES BY.

                         COP #1
          Did you see that? He didn't have a
          windshield.
          Cop #2 throws the car into drive and they pull a U-ey and

          GIVE CHASE.

          INT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

          Fred looks regretful.

                         FRED
          I'm sorry, man, I shouldn't have
          blamed you for this. I'm the one
          who dragged you into this thing.

                         RICK
          No, you didn't. I went willingly.

                         FRED
          I've been bad, Rick. I've been real
          bad.

                         RICK
          We've both been bad.

                         FRED
          I've been worse. I kissed your
          babysitter's aunt.

                         RICK
          That's not so bad.

          On the vagina.

                         RICK
          Ooh.
           They hear a SIREN and Rick looks back to see the cops on
          their tail.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.

          The battered MINI-VAN blows by the 'WELCOME TO CAPE COD'
          hedges with the cop car on their tail.

          No way, I can out-run 'em!

           Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE
          in the graffitied mini-van.

          The two Young Cops SCREECH to a stop behind the mini-van as
          the second cruiser flies up behind them.

                         COP #2
          We're on!
          The officers spring from their cars and quickly TACKLE Fred
          as he runs toward the front doors. Rick climbs out of the
          passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.

                         RICK
          Hear me out, gentlemen, I can
          explain everything!
          A BURLY OFFICER from the back-up car form-tackles Rick,
          BLASTING him backwards onto the sidewalk.
          Fred and Rick manage to roll away and then CRAWL THROUGH THE

          FRONT ENTRANCE.

          INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Our guys barely get in the door before being PUMMELED TO THE
          FLOOR by the four cops. The TWO PEOPLE seated in the waiting
          room STAND UP IN SHOCK and then a swarm of DOCTORS and
          ORDERLIES come running in to see what the commotion is.

          Grace needs me!
          Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across
          his legs.

                         COP #1
          Okay, just take it easy, buddy.

                         FRED
          No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm
          sorry I was speeding and I
          shouldn't have run from you guys,
          but my wife's been in an accident
          and she's in this emergency room
          and I gotta see how she is
          because...

                         (GROWS EMOTIONAL)

          .THAT WOMAN'S MY WHOLE LIFE!
          The cops look moved and unsure what to do.

                         DOCTOR
          Are you the husband of...
          (glances down at chart)
          .Grace Searing?
          Fred strains to look up.

                         FRED
          Yes! Is she okay?!
          The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then
          the Burly Officer releases Rick from his head-lock.

                         BURLY OFFICER
          All right, let him up.
          The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes
          to the Doctor, who seems very serious.

                         FRED
          Please tell me she's gonna be okay.

                         DOCTOR
          She is. Your wife broke her nose
          and she got shaken up a bit, but
          all in all she's a very lucky
          woman.

                         FRED
          You got that wrong, doc. I'm the
          lucky one.
          Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Bless you, doctor!
          Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs
          Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye.

                         RICK
          You take care of that woman, buddy,
          and I'm gonna go home and take care
          of mine.
          Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,
          unmoved. Rick starts to walk away.

                         FRED
          Rick...
          Rick stops and turns at the door.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You go love that lady!
          The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick.

                         BURLY OFFICER
          Uh, before you 'go love that lady',
          we're going to have to write you
          guys up.

          Rick steps quietly into the house. He sees two empty bottles
          of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table.
          Then he hears Maggie's O.S. VOICE coming from the bedroom.

          MAGGIE (O.S.)
          Oh my god...oh my god...oh my
          and...

          door.

          Rick ENTERS to find Maggie laying in bed... TALKING ON THE

          Maggie looks up, shocked to see Rick.

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hold on, Rick just walked in.

                         (TO RICK)
          Grace was in a car accident!

                         (INTO PHONE)

                          MAGGIE
          What?

                          RICK
           The day I lost my virginity. March
          25th, 1988 at approximately ten-
           thirty in the evening.
          Maggie thinks about this.

                         MAGGIE
          What are you talking about? We were
          dating then.
          Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands.

                         RICK
          You were my first. And you were my
          last. And you were everything in
          between.
          As it all sinks in, Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP.

                         MAGGIE
          Really?

                         RICK
          Really.

                         MAGGIE
          So...is that why you were crying
          that first night?
          Rick shrugs, embarrassed.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          And I was...I was your last?

                         RICK
          You are my only. Forever.

          Maggie smiles and runs into his arms. They KISS, and it's a
          real kiss, the kind they haven't had in a long while.

          EXT. BEACH COTTAGE - DAWN

           The sky is lightening but the sun hasn't risen yet. A taxi-
          van pulls up and Fred gets out. (Fred has a BLACK EYE.) He
           helps Grace out of the van, then pays the DRIVER. (Grace has
          TWO BLACK EYES and her nose is HEAVILY BANDAGED.) When the
          taxi drives off, Fred helps Grace toward the house.

                         FRED
          .And what were you doing driving
          around at one o'clock in the
          morning?

                         GRACE

                         (NERVOUS)
          Well...I was upset so I went for a
          drive--you know, to think--and I
          must have hit a patch of sand, and
          before I knew it I was into the
          pole.
          Fred stops and looks her in the eye.

                         FRED
          I'm sorry, Grace.

                         GRACE
          For what?

                         FRED
          For putting you through all this.
          Grace looks awash in guilt.

                         GRACE
          It's not your fault, Fred.

                         FRED
          Yes, it is--of course it's my
          fault. This isn't you--driving
          around all night, thinking--you're
          not a thinker.
          When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
          smile back.

                         GRACE
          Look, Fred, we have to talk
          about... about what happened this
          week.
          Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
          the moment.

                         FRED
          Grace. . .do we really have to do
          this?
          Grace lowers her head guiltily.

                         GRACE
          Yeah. Yeah, we do.
          When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and

          BATTERED MINI-VAN.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Horny old man?

                         FRED

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          Oh, no, honey, that's not me--they
          were talking about Rick.
          Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his
          knees.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, all you gotta know is that
          whatever happened doesn't matter! I
          love you and only you! And I'm
          going to treat you like the queen
          that you are for the rest of your
          living days, so help me God! I'll
          mow the lawn, I'll shovel the snow,
          I'll wash the stubble off the
          sink...
          Grace looks down at him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          .But please, I'm begging you,
          sweetie... can we please just never
          talk about what happened this week?
          Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.

                         GRACE
          Um...deal.
          Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          I love you, Fred.
          As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with
          his arm around Maggie. Fred shoots Rick a THUMBS-UP.
          CLOSE ON RICK AND MAGGIE as they smile at Fred and Grace.

                         RICK
          Come on, you two! We're gonna go
          watch the sun come up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.
          Hall & Oates's 'When The Morning Comes' begins to play and as
          our two HAPPY COUPLES hold hands and walk off toward the
          beach, we pull up, up, up, and...

                         FADE OUT:

                         THE END
