          EXT. RUDY'S - NIGHT
          
          It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.
          People stream into the bar to celebrate. Outside, CARL
          KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are
          having a quiet intense discussion.
          
                              KATH
                    You don't do anything more. You
                    used to be fun. Now you hardly
                    ever even leave your apartment.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm here, aren't I?
          
                              KATH
                    That's because it's New Year's Eve.
                    You have to be here. Besides, it's
                    not only social stuff. You used to
                    have dreams. You wanted to go to
                    business school, you wanted to work
                    for the World Bank.
          
                              CARL
                    So I discovered b-school's not for
                    me. People grow.
          
                              KATH
                    Growing is "X is not for me so I'll
                    do Y." You went X is not for me
                    and so I guess I'll sit on the
                    couch for the rest of my life.
          
                              CARL
                        (ACQUIESCING)
                    Well, look, this sucks, but I
                    understand where you're coming
                    from.
          
                              KATH
                    This is the problem. You don't
                    even care that I'm breaking up with
                    you.
          
                              CARL
                    Of course I care.   But I also
                    understand.
          
                              KATH
                    You shouldn't just understand. You
                    should be mad. Or upset. Or sad.
                    Or something.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    We're at different places in our
                    lives. I get it.
          
                              KATH
                    Your girlfriend of two years breaks
                    up with you right before New Year's
                    Eve and all you can say is "I get
                    it?" It is completely within your
                    right to call me a bitch.
          
                              CARL
                    That would be inappropriate.
          
                              KATH
                        (tearing up)
                    I can't believe I've been dating
                    someone so emotionless.
          
                               CARL
                    C'mere.   It'll be OK.
          
          Carl hugs her.
          
          
          INT. RUDY'S - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Rudy's is a dive bar. Dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden
          floors, Miller Lite sign, etc. The patrons are all FACING
          THE GIANT TELEVISION. The New Year's Ball is DROPPING.
          Among the patrons is our hero Carl, his best friend PETER,
          Peter's girlfriend LUCY, their party friend ROONEY and his ex-
          girlfriend, Kath who's still a little red-eyed.

                    Three, two, one... happy New Year!
          
          Everyone BLOWS NOISEMAKERS and POPS CHAMPAGNE.

                    Should auld acquaintance be forgot
                    and never brought to mind? Should
                    auld acquaintance be forgot and
                    days of auld lang syne?
          
                              CARL
                    Well, that was fantastic.   Good
                    night, guys.
          
                              PETER
                    You're going, already?
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          
                              KATH
                    We haven't even finished the song
                    yet.
          
                              CARL
                    I saw the ball drop and hugged all
                    of you. Aliens didn't invade. Our
                    computers are still working. What
                    else could possibly happen?
          
                              LUCY
                    Rooney might throw up.
          
                                 ROONEY
                    It's true.     I'm very close.
          
                              CARL
                    I see that happen like every night.
                    Good night and Happy New Year.
          
          Carl leaves.   His friends look concerned.
          
                              LUCY
                    How did he take the break-up?
          
                              KATH
                        (CRYING)
                    Like a robot. Two years, and
                    nothing.
          
                              LUCY
                    I'm so sorry.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Carl goes into his apartment. He lies down in his bed and
          closes his eyes. CLOSE ON THE ALARM. His alarm goes off.
          Carl HITS IT off. It's now DAYTIME.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Carl gets dressed.   He puts on a nametag for Southwest Bank.
          
          
          EXT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl walks down the street, fast. He passes a CUTE GIRL
          who's name we'll learn is RENEE passing out flyers for a band
          called "The Flying Buttresses."
          
                                                             4.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    Wanna rock out tonight?
          
                              CARL
                    I don't rock out.
          
          He walks into Dunkin Donuts.
          
          
          INT. DUNKIN DONUTS
          
          The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Would you like an Italian-inspired
                    coffee flavoring?
          
                                 CARL
                    No thanks.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    How about the double doughnut
                    special?
          
                                 CARL
                    No.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LATER
          
          Carl sits at his cubicle, flips on his email.
          
                              CARL
                        (reading the email)
                    Dear Trusted Foreigner, Allow me to
                    introduce myself. I am the deposed
                    King of Nigeria and I wish to
                    propose a confidential transaction.
                        (to the computer)
                    Allow me to delete you, my liege.
          
          NORMAN, his needy boss, comes up to him.
          
                              NORMAN
                    My teller reporting for duty.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm not a soldier.
          
                               NORMAN
                    You're a soldier on the front line
                    of finance.
                        (THEN)
                               (MORE)

                              NORMAN (cont'd)
                    So, Carl, I'm having a party this
                    Friday. It's a funny hat party.
                    May I entreat you to come?
          
          Carl looks at his calendar.   It's totally empty.
          
                              CARL
                        (clearly lying)
                    I'm out of town.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOBBY
          
          Carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the
          middle distance. A CUSTOMER approaches him.
          
                               BANK CUSTOMER
                    Hey, I need to speak to a loan
                    specialist and there's no one on
                    the floor.
          
                             CARL
                    Sorry. Today I'm officially a
                    greeter.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    But there's no one around.
          
                              CARL
                    Someone might come. And if I'm not
                    here, they won't be greeted.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    You're really not going to help me?
          
                              CARL
                    Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my
                    hands are tied.
          
          The Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area
          as Carl stands in the middle of the floor. It is very
          awkward. No one comes in. Carl slowly moves so a column
          blocks the customer's view of him.
          
          Now that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the
          entrance of the bank. Through the floor to ceiling windows,
          he sees the handsome NEW PRESIDENT OF SOUTHWEST BANK, CHRIS
          PARKER, tear up in a Mercedes. He steps out of the Mercedes
          with a hot girl on his arm. He and the girl walk into the
          bank. Carl stares at them, jealously.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Hey, there. I'm Chris Parker. The
                    new president of Southwest Bank.
                    Just wanted to come by and
                    personally introduce myself to
                    every branch manager.
          
                              NORMAN
                    That would be me.   Norman Calhoun.
          
          Chris turns to Carl.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm Carl Kendall.   Just a teller.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I was "just a teller." And now I'm
                    "just president of the largest bank
                    in the Southwest."
                        (to Norman)
                    You need anything, you let
                    corporate know. You hear?
          
                              NORMAN
                    Definitely.
          
          Chris Parker and his HOT SECRETARY leaves.     Carl watches
          them, clearly jealous.
          
                              NORMAN (cont'd)
                    Nice work if you can get it.   Am I
                    right?
          
                              CARL
                        (clearly jealous)
                    Yeah, if you're into fake breasts
                    and German engineering.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Check and check.
          
          The Bank Customer comes around.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    Can you help me now?
          
                              CARL
                    No, but this gentleman can.
          
          Carl indicates Norman.   Norman goes to help the customer.
          
                                                                       7.
          
          
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK
          
          Carl stares up at the clock.   The clock finally CLICKS TO
          5:00PM.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Think about my party, Carl!
          
                                 CARL
                    Will do!
          
          
          INT. CARL'S KITCHEN
          
          Carl microwaves a Lean Cuisine.

          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM
          
          Carl lays down and closes his eyes. The alarm GOES OFF
          again. PULL BACK to reveal it's morning.
          
          
          INT. DUNKIN DONUTS
          
          Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Would you like an Italian --
          
                                 CARL
                    No thanks.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    How about --
          
                                 CARL
                    No.
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl ignores the girl handing out fliers.

                       something red!
          
                                   CARL
                       Can't.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK
          
          Carl stares as the clock clicks to 5:00.        He's out the door.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S KITCHEN
          
          Carl warms up a frozen pizza.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl eats the frozen pizza and watches Big Brother.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM
          
          Carl lies down.       The alarm FLIPS ON.
          
          QUICK CUTS:

                       Sorry.
          
          -- CLOSE ON THE CLOCK.      IT FLIPS TO 5:00.
          
          -- AT HOME
          
          Carl eats frozen lasagna while watching The Amazing Race.

          THE IMAGES START TO MOVE FASTER:

          It's now just a blur of images of Carl at Southwest Bank,
          shaking his head `no', eating Lean Cuisine and watching
          reality television.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Carl's lying on his bed.      The phone is ringing.   He gets up
          and answers.
          
                                 CARL
                    Hello?
          
                              PETER (V.O.)
                        (on the phone)
                    Carl. It's Peter. Where are you?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm in bed. Why?       What happened?
                    Did someone die?
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
                              PETER (V.O.)
                        (on the phone)
                    No. It's just -- we're at Rudy's.
                    Celebrating New Year's.
          
          Carl looks at the alarm.     It's 11:15 PM.
          
                              CARL
                    It's already 11:15.     I don't think
                    I can make it.
          
                              PETER
                    Oh, c'mon, Carl. No one's seen you
                    for like forever. Please swing by?
          
                                CARL
                    No.

                    Tell everyone Happy New Year.
          
          Carl lies down and hangs up the phone.
          
          CUT TO LATER
          
          Carl watches his alarm clock FLIP TO 12:00AM.     He closes his
          eyes and goes to sleep.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTHWEST BANK
          
          Carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside. Several bank
          employees smoke cigarettes near him. An oddly hyper guy
          named ALEX approaches Carl.
          
                              ALEX
                    Carl Kendall?
          
                              CARL
                    Alex Eberts? What's up, buddy?
          
          Alex hugs Carl.
          
                              ALEX
                    Too much! How've you been? I
                    can't believe you're still working
                    here.
          
                              CARL
                    Where've you been? Norman's been
                    heartbroken since you quit.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
                              ALEX
                    Where've I been? You mean, where
                    haven't I been? This year. Dude.
                    I have lived. I climbed Mt.
                    Kilmanjaro. I ate bat in Laos. I
                    shot a cow with a bazooka. I'm not
                    proud of that last one but I did
                    it. How's the bank?
          
                              CARL
                    Same old same old.
          
                              ALEX
                    See? That's the problem. That's
                    everyone's problem. You've got one
                    life. Why waste it on the same old
                    same old?
          
          Alex hands Carl a pamphlet for a "Just Say Yes" seminar.
          
                              ALEX (cont'd)
                    I know this will sound queer, but
                    you have to hit this seminar. It
                    changed my life. It will change
                    yours. Unless you like the bank.
          
                               CARL
                    You kidding? Every day it's
                    impossible not to throw rocks at
                    the place.
                        (JOKING)
                    Since you don't work here anymore,
                    you want to throw a couple?
          
                              ALEX
                    Yes.
          
          Alex starts WHIPPING rocks at the bank.
          
                              CARL
                    What're you doing!   Stop that!   I
                    was kidding!
          
          Norman comes out.
          
                              NORMAN
                    What do you think you're doing?
                        (recognizing Alex)
                    Alex Eberts! Is this an alumnae
                    prank? I love pranks!
          
                              ALEX
                    Hey, Norman!
          
                                                                    12.
          
          
          
          Alex continues throwing rocks at the bank.
          
                              NORMAN
                        (into a walkie-talkie)
                    We have a situation.
          
          A couple portly security guards come out and wrestle Alex to
          the ground. He manages to escape and run from the bank.
          
                              ALEX
                    Go to the seminar, Carl!    You won't
                    be sorry!
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl walks into his apartment.    He hits PLAY on his answering
          machine.
          
                              PETER (V.O.)
                        (over the answering
                         MACHINE)
                    Carl, it's Peter. I know you don't
                    do things anymore, but it'd mean a
                    lot if you'd come by Rudy's
                    tonight. Lucy and I are
                    celebrating our engagement.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Carl's watching Hell's Kitchen and eating a frozen pizza.
          There's a knock on the door. The "Just Say Yes" pamphlet
          balled up on his desk. He's using it as a napkin. Carl
          PAUSES the television show. He stands up and opens the door.
          Peter STUMBLES IN.
          
                              CARL
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              PETER
                    This is an intervention.    You've
                    missed your last event.
          
                              CARL
                    What're you talking about?
          
                              PETER
                    Our engagement party.
          
                                 CARL
                    I'm sorry.     I'm just really busy.
          
                                                13.
          
          
          
                    PETER
          You're watching Hell's Kitchen.
          That's not even B-list reality TV.
          
                    CARL
          So I don't want to go out tonight.
          Maybe I have to wake up early
          tomorrow. You don't know.
          
                    PETER
          It's bigger than that. You and
          Kath broke up over a year ago and
          you still aren't dating anyone.
          
                    CARL
          What? So? I'm like a sexual
          camel. I only need it once every
          couple years.
          
                    PETER
          I don't mean to be harsh but
          everyone's moving forward. It's
          like you're still wearing a Timex
          while the rest of us each have
          entry level Rolexes.
          
                    CARL
          You wear a Rolex?
          
                    PETER
          Thanks for noticing. It's an
          Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster.
          Sapphire crystal, self-winding.
          Four Gs. But that's not the point
          I'm trying to make.
          
                    CARL
          So I don't have an oyster watch.
          All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit
          around and talk about real estate
          and Crate and Barrel.
          
                    PETER
          What's wrong with Crate and Barrel?
          They have adorable stuff at
          reasonable prices.
          
                    CARL
          Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm
          just getting more mature. I don't
          need the lifestyle ever night.
          
                                                 14.
          
          
          
                    PETER
          Lifestyle? You have to have a life
          to have a style of life. You never
          leave your apartment. You never
          meet anyone new.
          
                    CARL
          I hate meeting people.
          
                    PETER
          You've become a complete cave
          dweller.
          
                    CARL
          I am not a cave dweller. Just the
          other day, we all went to
          Summerfest and snuck backstage and
          you bet me I wouldn't steal
          something and so I stole a
          drumstick from that horrible
          Swedish hillbilly band. That's not
          very cave dweller of me.
          
                     PETER
          Just the other day?   That was seven
          years ago.
          
                    CARL
          But that's not possible -- I was
          already working at the bank by
          then.
          
                    PETER
          You had started there three years
          earlier. Why you've worked at that
          place for so long is beyond me.
          You had so much potential. You
          shouldn't be a teller. You should
          be the guy who tells the guy who
          tells the teller what to do.
          
                    CARL
              (SHOCKED)
          I've been a teller at Southwest
          Bank for ten years? How the hell
          did that happen?
              (doing the math)
          Ten years... if I had had a child,
          he'd be toilet-trained by now.
          
                    PETER
          Actually, he'd be in fourth grade.
          
                                                                   15.
          
          
          
                               CARL
                        (starting to panic)
                    I was making out with chicks by
                    fourth grade. I was a little man
                    by fourth grade.
                        (THEN)
                    Whatever. I don't need this shit
                    right now. I'm an adult man. I
                    can live my life as I see fit. Can
                    you please leave?
          
          Carl pushes Peter out the door. Carl sits down on the couch.
          He then unballs the "Just Say Yes" pamphlet. It features an
          Indian man smiling beatifically.
          
                                                        MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          A banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian
          man smiling beatifically. We PAN DOWN to find Carl among the
          crowd. Carl sits down next to a WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN.
          
                              WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN
                    Is this your first time at one of
                    Sanji's lectures?
          
                               CARL
                        (SCOFFING)
                    Uh, yeah.
                        (THEN)
                    Have you been to this before?
          
                              WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN
                    Only like fifty-eight times.
                    Sanji's a genius. Like
                    seriously... he will blow your mind
                    all over the goddamn room. He's
                    like a mind grenade.
          
                              CARL
                    I don't know if I want that.
          
                              WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN
                    Oh you do not. But you need it.
                    And that's why you are here.
          
                              CARL
                    Cool. Do you want anything from
                    the refreshment area?
          
                                                                      16.
          
          
          
                              WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN
                    You kidding? That processed shit
                    will kill you faster than a
                    pleasure cruise to Chernobyl.
          
          Carl heads over to the refreshment table. Once he's out of
          her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference
          room. Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers.
          People begin to sit. Carl sits down in the back.
          
                               SANJI (V.O.)
                    Life.   We are all living it.
          
          Carl laughs.   No one else does.   The lights get rosier.
          
                              SANJI (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    Or are we? Change doesn't start on
                    the surface. It's generated from
                    consciousness. But where is
                    consciousness generated from?
          
          Carl looks around.   Everyone is nodding along with it.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    From the external. And the
                    external is manipulated through our
                    choices. And our choices start
                    with one word.
          
          The music ABRUPTLY SWITCHES to the opening beats of "Jump" by
          the Pointer Sisters. The rosy colored lights FLIP TO BRIGHT
          WHITE and SWEEP ACROSS THE CONVENTION CENTER ROOM. It is
          suddenly like a rock concert. SANJI (50s) BUSTS THROUGH THE
          GIANT BANNER. The whole crowd starts CHEERING.
          
                               SANJI (cont'd)
                    Yes!
          
          Instead of "Jump", Sanji's yelling "Yes!"
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    Say yes! For your life! Yes!
                    Change starts now! Yes! Yes!
                    Yes! Say it with me! SAY YES!
          
          Sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks GO
          OFF. The crowd JUMPS ON THEIR FEET.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    Are you ready to open the door to
                    yes?
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                 CROWD
                    Yes!
          
                              SANJI
                    I am sorry, my friends.      But I
                    cannot hear you?
          
                                 CROWD
                    Yes!
          
                                 SANJI
                    Shhhhhhh.
          
          The crowd quiets.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    Now is the time when we must greet
                    our new members. Who here is new?
                    Please, do not be shy.
          
                                 WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN
                    He is!
          
          The woman POINTS AT Carl.      The spotlight SWINGS OVER to Carl.
          He is annoyed.
          
                              SANJI
                    Come on up, Future Yes Man!
          
                                 CARL
                    That's OK.     I'm just auditing.
          
                              SANJI
                    You can't audit life!      Now get on
                    up here!
          
                              CARL
                    I'm cool right here.
          
                              SANJI
                    Then I will come to you!
          
          Sanji runs off the stage and joins Carl in the back of the
          conference hall. The spotlights follow him.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    What is your name?
          
                                 CARL
                    Carl.
          
                                                           18.
          
          
          
                              SANJI
                    Let me guess, Carl. This was not
                    your idea to come here, Carl.
          
                              CARL
                    I wouldn't say that.
          
                              SANJI
                    You can tell me, Carl.    We are all
                    alone, Carl.
          
          The crowd laughs.
          
                              CARL
                    It wasn't exactly my idea.
          
                              SANJI
                    That's what I thought, Carl. And
                    you think this is all bullshit,
                    Carl, isn't that right, Carl?
          
                                CARL
                    Honestly?
          
                              SANJI
                    Is there any other way?
          
                              CARL
                    This whole thing seems retarded.
          
                              SANJI
                    But you are stuck in your life,
                    Carl? Am I right?
          
                              CARL
                    I wouldn't necessarily --
          
                              SANJI
                    You once had a dream? You wanted
                    to own a boat? A house? A fancy
                    car? You wanted to a doctor, a
                    lawyer... a business man?
          
          Carl nods, surprised at Sanji's incisiveness.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    You wanted to be more than you are.
                    And yet you have suddenly woken up
                    to find life is passing you by. Am
                    I right, Carl?
          
                                                                       19.
          
          
          
          Sanji's suddenly getting to Carl. As Sanji talks to him, the
          moment between them becomes more and more intimate. It
          should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.
          
                                CARL
                    A little.
          
                              SANJI
                    It's odd that ten years can pass
                    just like that.
          
          Sanji snaps.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    Isn't it, Carl?
          
                                CARL
                    It is.
          
                              SANJI
                    I want you to do something for me,
                    Carl. Tomorrow, I want you only to
                    say yes. Can you do that for me?
                    For one day, Carl?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm not sure --
          
                              SANJI
                    Please, Carl. Do it for me and you
                    will be doing it for yourself. If
                    you don't have the best day in ten
                    years then I am the uncle of a
                    monkey. Will you do it for me
                    Carl? Just for a day?
          
                                CARL
                    Yes?
          
          Sanji grabs Carl hand and PULLS HIM to his feet.   We PULL
          BACK and the crowd CHEERS.
          
                              SANJI
                    Welcome to the world of yes!
          
          Fireworks and confetti go off.    The Wiry, Anxious Woman Gives
          Carl a creepy thumbs up.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Carl's asleep. The phone starts ringing.     Carl sleepily
          grabs the phone.
          
                                                                       20.
          
          
          
                                 CARL
                    Yello.
          
                              PETER (V.O.)
                        (on the phone)
                    Carl, it's Peter. I just wanted to
                    apologize about barging in
                    yesterday. You were right. It's
                    your life to live.
          
                              CARL
                    Don't worry about it.
          
                              PETER (V.O.)
                        (on the phone)
                    Me, Lucy and Kath are all going out
                    for brunch. You have any interest
                    in joining?
          
                              CARL
                    Oh, thanks for the invite, but...
          
          FLASH OF SANJI LOOMING LARGE IN CARL'S EYES.
          
                               SANJI
                    Will you do it for me Carl?       Just
                    for a day?
          
          BACK TO CARL AND PETER.       We CLOSE IN ON CARL'S MOUTH.
          
                                 CARL
                           (in slo-mo)
                    Yes.
          
                                 PETER
                    Excuse me?
          
                              CARL
                        (clearly not wanting to)
                    Yes. I will come to brunch.
          
          
          EXT. STACKERS - MORNING
          
          Stackers is a cutesie brunch place.      Carl walks up to Peter,
          Lucy and Kath.
          
                              KATH
                        (AWKWARD)
                    Morning, Carl. This is a surprise.
          
                                 CARL
                    Why?
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
                              KATH
                    Because I've never seen you at
                    brunch. Like ever.
          
                              CARL
                    You kidding? I love brunch.
          
          
          INT. STACKERS - LATER
          
          Carl, Peter, Lucy and Kath are still waiting with a big crowd
          of people to sit down for brunch.
          
                              CARL
                    Why do people wait an hour for
                    breakfast? It's so hot and bright
                    and we haven't even had coffee yet.
          
                              PETER
                    If you don't want to be here, you
                    don't have to be.
          
                              CARL
                    Of course I want to be here. I
                    love waiting an hour for eggs.
                    It's fun. Although I will point
                    out that you have sunglasses which
                    is probably making this wait a lot
                    easier.
          
                              PETER
                    Oakleys, polarized lenses,
                    indestructible. Two fifty but
                    worth every penny.
          
          The Waitress comes up.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Lowell, party of five.
          
          A group of four people get up to be seated.
          
                              CARL
                    We were definitely before those
                    Lowell people.
          
                              KATH
                    I hate when people jump ahead.
          
                              CARL
                    Why does no one ever say anything?
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
                              PETER
                    If you want to be sitting so bad,
                    why don't you say something?
          
                               CARL
                    Yes.   I will.
          
          Carl walks up to the Waitress.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Excuse me, but we were here before
                    those people.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    No you weren't.
          
                              CARL
                    Yes, we were.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    I have the list, dude.   The list
                    doesn't lie.
          
          Meanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are
          looking away, trying not to get involved.
          
                              CARL
                    Well, this time the list lied.
          
                              LUCY
                    It's OK, Carl. It's just brunch.
          
                              CARL
                        (to the people who are
                         being seated)
                    You all know that we were up before
                    you! And you have to live with
                    that knowledge through your
                    delightful brunch!
          
          Peter pulls Carl away from the Waitress.
          
                              PETER
                    What's going on with you?
          
                              CARL
                    I just want transparency in terms
                    of the brunch seating order.
          
          One of the customers who was being seated heads over.
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
                             KATH
                    Great. Now we're going to get into
                    a fight.
          
                              BRUNCH DUDE
                    We talked about what you said...
                    you're right. You guys were here
                    before us. Sorry we didn't pipe up
                    sooner. We cool, brother?
          
                              CARL
                        (SURPRISED)
                    Yeah. We cool.
          
          Carl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug.
          
          
          INT. STACKERS - LATER
          
          Carl and his friends are sitting at a table.    Carl's slightly
          bored as his friends discuss real estate.
          
                              LUCY
                    It's a two bedroom duplex with
                    harbor views. It'd be perfect for
                    you Kath.
          
                              KATH
                    Washer/Dryer in the building?
          
                              CARL
                        (JEALOUS)
                    I didn't realize you were looking
                    to buy a place. I thought you and I
                    would be renters to the end.
          
                              PETER
                    She's a fancy lawyer making bank.
                    It's about time she was buying.
          
                              KATH
                        (PLAYFUL)
                    Shut up.
          
          The Brunch Dude is seated near Carl. He gives him a thumbs
          up. Carl gives a thumbs up right back.
          
                              PETER
                        (re: the menus)
                    What're you looking at?
          
                              CARL
                    Bacon and eggs.
          
                                                       24.
          
          
          
                              KATH
                    How unadventurous.
          
                              CARL
                    I don't want an adventure first
                    thing in the morning.
          
          The Waitress comes over.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    I just want to tell you about my
                    specials. We have a double fruit
                    burnt sugar waffle. Any of you
                    interested in that?
          
          Beat.
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrighty. Then, on the savory
                    side, we have a smoked whitefish
                    omelet with hash browns on the
                    side. Any takers?
          
          Beat.
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (SURPRISED)
                    You want both?
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
          The Waitress writes that down.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Would you like toast with that?
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                                WAITRESS
                    Any side?    Bacon.
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                                                          25.
          
          
          
                                 WAITRESS
                    Sausage.
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Turkey sausage?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    A side of our famous maple pancakes
                    --
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                                WAITRESS
                    Wow.    Someone's really hungry.
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Coffee or juice?
          
                                CARL
                    Coffee.    And juice.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    We also have smoothies?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
          Carl's friends look at him like a freak.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Is that all?
          
                                 CARL
                           (RELIEVED)
                    Yes.
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (turning towards his
                         FRIENDS)
                    What would you all like to order?
          
          His friends are all looking at Carl.

          Carl has six dishes in front of him.     The Waitress comes over
          with a pepper mill.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Would you like some pepper?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
          The Waitress starts grinding pepper onto Carl's meal. It's
          starting to take a long time. She's grinding and grinding
          and grinding.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Would you like more?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
          She keeps grinding.    A pile of pepper's growing on his food.
          
          
          INT. STACKERS - LATER
          
          All of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper.
          
                              PETER
                    I don't think I've ever seen a
                    waiter tap one of those pepper
                    mills.
          
                               CARL
                    I'm just addicted to the stuff.
                    Chinese cultures say it's good for
                    digestion.
                        (THEN)
                    You're all welcome to have some.
          
                              LUCY
                    That's... OK. Do you want a bite
                    of mine?
          
                                 CARL
                           (BEGRUDGINGLY)
                    Yes.
          
          Carl takes a bite of Lucy's.      He then sips his coffee.
          
                                                                  27.

                    Uch. Brunch coffee. Why can't
                    they make it black without all this
                    frothy shit?
          
                              PETER
                    Because you ordered a latte.
          
          Carl's phone rings.   He answers it.
          
                              NORMAN (O.S.)
                    Hey, Carl. We're a little short on
                    our Saturday staff. I know this is
                    going against ten years of
                    precedent, but you have any
                    interest in coming in today?
          
                              CARL
                    I don't think... there's any reason
                    why I shouldn't? On a Saturday
                    there's nothing I like more than
                    the inside of a bank.
          
                              NORMAN (O.S.)
                    There really is something magical
                    about this place.
          
          
          INT. DUNKIN DONUTS
          
          Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Would you like an Italian-inspired
                    coffee flavoring?
          
          Beat.
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet?
          
                              CARL
                    All of them please.
          
          The confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee.
          
                               DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    We're having a special on
                    Munchkins?
          
                                                                   28.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and
          several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee, the cute girl
          who hands out band fliers.
          
                              RENEE
                    Want a flier? Oh, it's you.    Never
                    mind.
          
                              CARL
                    Of course I'll take a flier.
          
          Carl takes a flier.   Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                        (READING)
                    The Flying Buttresses.
          
                              RENEE
                    I knew after a year and a half of
                    wearing you down, you'd give in.
                    I'm Renee by the way.
          
          Renee holds out her hand.
          
                                CARL
                    Carl.
          
                              RENEE
                    Carl. Cool. I like to thank
                    everyone personally who comes to
                    our performances. It gives it a
                    nice intimate touch. See you soon
                    Carl.
          
          Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation.
          He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK
          
          Carl STUMBLES INTO work, hyper from the giant coffee.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Morning, Carl. Thanks for coming
                    in and being part of the Saturday
                    banking experience. Oooh,
                    Munchkins. Are those for the
                    office, you dirty devil?
          
                                                                   29.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    Yeah. I just though it would be a
                    fun way to lighten things up.
          
                              NORMAN
                        (deadly serious)
                    You didn't approve this with petty
                    cash.
          
                              CARL
                    I spent my own money on them...
          
                              NORMAN
                    Kidding! Munchkins are always
                    approved. Although, I can't
                    reimburse you.
                        (over the intercom)
                    Today is free Munchkin day. That's
                    right! Free Munchkin day!
          
          Instantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers.

          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK LOUNGE
          
          Carl's greeting.   A MIDDLE-AGED MOTHERLY CUSTOMER comes in.
          
                              CARL
                    How may I help you?
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    I need to speak to a loan
                    specialist.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CARL
                    While loans aren't normally in my
                    jurisdiction, I'd be happy to help
                    you.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK
          
          Carl's trying to keep up as the customer launches into
          intense finance-speak.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    I want to refi my house and spend
                    the capital on my personal
                    business. I see you've got a 5.25
                    7 year ARM, but over at Chase
                    they're offering 5.00 7 year ARM.
                    Can you refi lower, like at 4.85
                    par example, or am I going to have
                    to bring my beeswax elsewhere?
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                               BANK CUSTOMER
                    Yes?   That's it?
          
                               CARL
                    Yup.   What's your business?
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    Selling beanie babies online.
          
                                CARL
                    Adorable.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    More like highly profitable.    I've
                    crunched the numbers.
          
          The woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with
          construction paper and pictures of beanie babies. Carl opens
          the scrapbook. It's filled with numbers.
          
                              CARL
                    Let me just get final approval on
                    this.
          
          Carl gets up and walks over to Norman.
          
          ANGLE ON NORMAN'S OFFICE
          
          Carl stands before Norman.
          
                              NORMAN
                    You're a teller, not a loan
                    specialist.
          
                              CARL
                    No, I know, so if you think this is
                    a bad idea for a loan that's fine
                    but can you please tell her
                    yourself?
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
                              NORMAN
                    What's this?
          
                              CARL
                    Her business plan.
          
          Norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Inta-maresting. My grandma loves
                    beanie babies. Although
                    unfortunately, we have a minimum
                    loan floor of ten thousand dollars.
                    She only wants five.
          
                              CARL
                    That's silly. How're you supposed
                    to start a tiny business if you
                    can't get a tiny business loan?
          
                               NORMAN
                    I don't make the rules, I just
                    break `em.
                        (THEN)
                    I don't break them. I just wanted
                    to rhyme. If she wants us to loan
                    her ten thousand or more, great.
                    Otherwise, I think her only option
                    is a loan shark.
          
          ANGLE ON LOAN DESK
          
          Carl sits back down.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                        (NERVOUS)
                    So, what'd he say?
          
                              CARL
                    Do you maybe have any interest in
                    borrowing ten thousand?
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    I can't afford the payments on ten.
                    You can't do five thousand? This
                    is the fifth bank I've been to.
                    Please?
          
                              CARL
                    Of course we can.    One moment
                    please.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
          
          Carl gets up. He heads over to the soda machine and buys a
          Diet Coke. He then heads over to Norman's desk.
          
                                 CARL (cont'd)
                    Diet Coke?
          
                              NORMAN
                    Oooh, thank you. Feed the
                    addiction, am I right?
          
          They clink Diet Cokes. Norman DOWNS his entire Diet Coke in
          one swallow. Carl then heads over to the photocopier. He
          watches Norman out of the corner of his eye. After a couple
          minutes, Norman gets up and HEADS INTO THE BATHROOM. Carl
          heads back over to Norman's desk and SWIPES THE LOAN APPROVAL
          STAMP.
          
          ANGLE ON THE LOAN DESK
          
          Carl returns to the loan desk and STAMPS HER FORM.
          
                              CARL
                    It's approved.
          
          The Bank Customer HUGS Carl.
          
                              BANK CUSTOMER
                    Thank you so much! I promise I
                    won't let you down, Mr. Kendall.
                    On me.
          
          The Bank Customer hands Carl a panda beanie baby.
          
                              CARL
                    Thanks, Marge. We don't like to
                    make other customers jealous so can
                    we keep this between you and I?
          
                                 BANK CUSTOMER
                    Of course.     Aren't you just a dear?
          
          The Bank Customer leaves.    Carl can't help but be touched.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK
          
          Carl's at the loan desk.    Norman comes over, looking grave.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Carl, could I see you for a moment?
          
          Carl nervously walks into his office.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
          
          INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE
          
          Carl nervously sits before Norman.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Earlier today, you showed some
                    initiative. And I loved it. What
                    do you say to a permanent spot at
                    the loan desk?
          
                              CARL
                    That seems like a lot of
                    responsibility.
          
                              NORMAN
                    We need a loan specialist a lot
                    more than we need a teller and
                    greeter. Besides, you'd have a
                    starting salary of 52.
          
                                 CARL
                    Grand?
          
                              NORMAN
                    No, dollars. What is this Darfur?
                        (waving to an African-
                         American employee)
                    Sorry, Patricia, that was
                    inappropriate.
                        (then, back to Carl)
                    Of course grand. To celebrate,
                    next Saturday, I'm throwing a
                    party. Dress up as your favorite
                    character from Heroes.

                    world.
          
                              CARL
                    Next Saturday... sounds great.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Don't dress as Hiro.    I got dibs.
          
                              CARL
                    Wouldn't think of it.
          
          Carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RUDY'S
          
          Carl walks in the door. Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's
          clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Carl Kendall? Out in the world?
                    Are you some kind of ghost? Am I
                    having a religious vision?
          
                              CARL
                    Believe it. Because this guy just
                    got a promotion.
          
                              LUCY
                    Congrats, Carl!
          
                              ROONEY
                    Well let's get you a beer. You
                    want a 20 ouncer? I'm just joking -
                    -
          
                              CARL
                    Yes.
          
          Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy.
          
                              PETER
                    A normal-sized beer is fine with
                    me.
          
                              LUCY
                    I think I'm done actually.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Two twenty ouncers and one tiny,
                    little beer, barkeep.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Please don't call me that.   We're
                    not in the middle ages.
          
                              ROONEY
                        (to Carl)
                    I can't believe you're out here.
                    I'm giddy. I feel like a child
                    whose best friend has strict
                    Chinese parents who never let him
                    come out and play but now his
                    Chinese parents are away for the
                    Chinese New Year. You have any
                    interest in pounding this shit?
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                                CARL
                    Why not?
          
          Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty
          ouncer. Carl reluctantly pounds it as well. Rooney slams
          his on the table. Carl puts it on the table.
          
                              ROONEY
                    What do you say we have another?
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              ROONEY
                    You are a beast!
          
                              LUCY
                    Well, it's been fun watching you
                    guys recreate freshman year, but
                    Peter and I have some furniture
                    errands to run.
          
          Carl's a little drunk now.
          
                              CARL
                    Have a good day yuppifying your
                    lives.
          
                              PETER
                    We need a sofa, Carl.     We're not
                    buying a second home.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Whatever, yuppy sellouts.
          
                              LUCY
                    It was good seeing you.    You should
                    come out more often.
          
                               CARL
                         (kind of pleading)
                    Please don't leave me here with
                    him.
          
          Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious.
          They leave.
          
          
          INT. RUDY'S - NIGHT
          
          Carl and Rooney are really drunk.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    I have not been this drunk in
                    years! The room is spinning in a
                    bad way!
          
                              ROONEY
                    Barkeep! Two more double pints
                    s'il vous plait!
          
                              BARTENDER
                    That was the last `barkeep.'   I am
                    cutting you off.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Well fortunately you're not the
                    only game in town! Let's go to
                    some place with class.
          
          
          INT. SENOR FROG'S - NIGHT
          
          Rooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs.
          
                              CARL
                    Where's the class?
          
                              ROONEY
                    They wear uniforms here.
          
          A SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS comes over.
          
                              SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS
                    Jello shot?
          
                              CARL
                    Yes.
          
          Carl and Rooney do jello shots.
          
          QUICK CUTS:
          
          -- Carl and Rooney downing more jello shots.
          
          -- Carl and Rooney drinking beers.
          
          -- Carl and Rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of
          girls.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    That girl is hot. Or at least she
                    seems hot. I'm kind of too drunk
                    to tell. Right now, honestly, you
                    seem hot.
          
                                                                       37.
          
          
          
                                ROONEY
                    I am hot.
          
                              SENOR FROG'S WAITRESS
                    Another jello shot?
          
          
          
                      CARL                               ROONEY
          Yes.                               I think I'm done.
          
          Carl downs the jello shot.     He stumbles a little.
          
                              SENOR FROG'S DJ
                    Senor Frog's famous karoake contest
                    is starting now! Sign up and sweep
                    us off our feet!
          
                              ROONEY
                    You gotta do karoake.
          
          Carl STUMBLES over to the Senor Frog's DJ.     He's losing
          control and he likes it.
          
                              CARL
                    Sign me up, bitch.
          
                              SENOR FROG'S DJ
                    We've got our first victim... I
                    mean, singer.
          
          MUSIC CUE: The opening notes of White Town's "Your Woman"
          
          Carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd.
          (NOTE TO READER: As you read this part, I recommend listening
          to White Town's "Your Woman." It will bring it to life in a
          way that words on a page cannot do it justice.)
          
                               CARL
                         (singing/talking with an
                          odd English accent)
                    Just tell me what you've got to say
                    to me, I've been waiting for so
                    long to hear the truth, It comes as
                    no surprise at all you see, So cut
                    the crap and tell me that we're
                    through. Now I know your heart, I
                    know your mind, You don't even know
                    you're being unkind, So much for
                    all your highbrow Marxist ways,
                    Just use me up and then you walk
                    away, Boy you can't play me that
                    way.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
          Carl heads over to the HOT GIRL and begins SERENADING HER.
          She thinks it's kind of funny.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Well I guess what you say is true,
                    I could never be the right kind of
                    girl for you, I could never be your
                    woman.
          
          Carl gets really close to the Hot Girl's face and then COYLY
          pulls away for the bridge of the song. During the awesome
          bridge, Carl does some fantastic dance moves. Or rather,
          moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of
          your mind. The Hot Girl laughs at his antics.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Well I guess what they say is true,
                    I could never spend my life with a
                    man like you, I could never be your
                    woman. I could never be your
                    woman. I could never be your
                    woman.
          
          Carl lands on one knee in front of the Hot Girl. The crowd
          CHEERS FOR HIM. The Hot Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND gets up close
          to Carl. Everyone is very, very drunk.
          
                              BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    Were you just flirting with my
                    girlfriend?
          
                              CARL
                        (re: the Hot Girl)
                    It depends -- is that your
                    girlfriend?
          
                                BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    Yes.
          
                                CARL
                    Then yes.
          
                              HOT GIRL
                    Hey, c'mon. Be cool.    He was just
                    screwing around.
          
                              BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    Let me handle this, Crystal.
                        (to Carl)
                    So, you want to have sex with my
                    girlfriend?
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes, I do.     Very much.
          
                              BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    Are you starting a fight?
          
                              ROONEY
                    C'mon, Carl, let's go --
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes, I am.
          
                              BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    Then bring it.
          
                                 CARL
                    I will.
          
          Beat. Carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him
          across the face the way a woman would slap a man.
          
                              BRUTISH BOYFRIEND
                    What was that?
          
                              CARL
                    Me bringing it.
          
          The Brutish Boyfriend PUNCHES Carl in the head.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    I'm too drunk to feel!  I'm like
                    Darkman!
          
          Carl HEADBUTTS the guy. They get into a dirty, drunken
          tussle. Both of them are trying to hit the other one in the
          groin region. Bouncers DESCEND ON THEM and PULL THEM APART.
          
          
          EXT. SENOR FROG'S
          
          Carl and Rooney are outside.    Carl's nursing his wounds.
          They are very, very drunk.
          
                              ROONEY
                    You popped that guy!    He didn't
                    know what hit him.
          
                              CARL
                    You do not cross Carl Kendall.
          
          The Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's.
          
                                                                      40.
          
          
          
                              HOT GIRL
                    Hey. I'm sorry about Domingo. He
                    likes to think he's my boyfriend
                    but he's not. You're cute.
          
          The Hot Girl KISSES Carl.
          
                              HOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D)
                    Want to go some place private?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Light is streaming in through the window. Carl opens his
          eyes. He's in bad shape. He looks over to see the Hot Girl
          finishing getting dressed.
          
                              HOT GIRL
                    My fiance called. He was like
                    really sorry about last night.      I
                    have to go.
          
                              CARL
                    Your fiance?
          
                              HOT GIRL
                    Domingo. The guy who punched you
                    in the face.
          
                              CARL
                    I thought you said you two weren't
                    even dating?
          
                              HOT GIRL
                    We were broken up last night.      It
                    was fun hanging out.
          
          The Hot Girl kisses Carl on the forehead.
          
                              HOT GIRL (cont'd)
                    I made some coffee. It's in the
                    kitchen. Sorry for leading you on.
          
          The Hot Girl LEAVES.    Carl smiles.    That was awesome.
          
          
          INT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          Carl runs to the conference room.      The Just Say Yes seminar
          has been packed up.
          
                                                                41.
          
          
          
          
          INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY
          
          Carl walks up to the counter.
          
                              CARL
                    Hi... is there a Sanji Gupta
                    staying here?
          
                                RECEPTIONIST
                    Room 125.
          
          
          INT. HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY
          
          Carl walks down the hallway. He knocks on Room 125. After a
          couple minutes of shuffling around, Sanji opens the door.
          
                                CARL
                    I'm Carl.    The guy from yesterday.
          
                              SANJI
                    Of course, of course!      Please come
                    in!
          
          Carl comes into Sanji's hotel room.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    Would you like a cup of coffee?
          
                              CARL
                    No thanks. I just wanted to thank
                    you for that inspiration.
          
                              SANJI
                    Fantastic. So how do you plan on
                    continuing with your journey?
          
                              CARL
                    You know, just living every day to
                    it's fullest. And, like, learning
                    to continue to experience life or
                    whatever.
          
                              SANJI
                    Outstanding, Carl. Except for one
                    THING:
                        (suddenly intense)
                    You are completely bullshitting me!
          
                                                          42.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    I just said I'm going to keep
                    experiencing life. I thought you'd
                    be happy.
          
                              SANJI
                    You're like a cigarette addict,
                    Carl. Except you're addicted to
                    boredom. On the way in here, Carl,
                    I offered you a coffee and you
                    refused. Perhaps that would have
                    been the most delicious cup of
                    coffee you would have ever had.
                    Who's to say? Not you, Carl,
                    because you said no! Anyone can
                    quit smoking for a day. But for a
                    lifetime? No.
          
                              CARL
                    So what should I do?
          
          Sanji PULLS OUT a contract.
          
                              SANJI
                    Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto.
          
          Carl takes the Maniyesto.
          
                              CARL
                        (reading the document)
                    1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say
                    yes. 2) The yes cannot distort the
                    truth.
          
                              SANJI
                        (EXPLAINING)
                    You cannot say "Yes, the world is
                    flat" because that is an untruth.
          
                              CARL
                        (reading the document)
                    3) If someone discovers you are a
                    yes man, you do not have to say yes
                    to them. 4) To avoid yes, you
                    cannot avoid contact. Therefore,
                    you must always answer your phone,
                    the door, your postal mail, your
                    email, etc and so on and so forth.
                    5) You must choose a yesponsor to
                    keep you on the straight and
                    narrow.
                        (to Sanji)
                    Who should that be?
          
                                                          43.
          
          
          
                              SANJI
                    A close friend who will not tell a
                    soul.
          
                              CARL
                        (reading the document)
                    5) I hereby void the "do you want"
                    loophole.
                        (to Sanji)
                    What is that?
          
                               SANJI
                    If someone asks you "do you want to
                    go to the art museum" and you do
                    not want to, you may not use this
                    lack of desire as an excuse to not
                    go. And finally, a warning.
                        (SPOOKILY)
                    If you say `no', even once, even
                    for a cup of coffee, be prepared to
                    lose every single little thing
                    you've gained.
                        (THEN)
                    So what do you say, Carl?
                        (WHISPERING)
                    What do you say?
          
                              CARL
                    I say... yes.
          
          Carl signs the Maniyesto.
          
                                SANJI
                    And here.
          
          Carl signs again.
          
                                SANJI (cont'd)
                    And here.
          
          Carl signs again.
          
                              SANJI (cont'd)
                    And initial here. And here.
          
                              CARL
                    Is this like a legal document?
          
                              SANJI
                    Kind of. And finally, my friend,
                    please hold out your hand.
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          
          Carl holds out his hand. Sanji PULLS OUT an iron brand
          that's been heating over a hot pot and BRANDS CARL'S PALM.
          
                                 CARL
                    AHHHHHHHH!
          
                              SANJI
                    That should heal by New Year's.
                    Until then, you are a Yes Man.
          
          Carl looks at his palm.       In the center of the palm, Sanji's
          branded a `YES.'
          
          
          INT. RUDY'S
          
          Carl is sitting across from Peter.

                    For a whole year?
          
                              CARL
                    Yesterday I got promoted and beat
                    up and hooked up with this chick
                    and I have a massive headache today
                    and I still might throw up, but I
                    don't care because it was the best
                    time I've had in like forever. Not
                    to mention finding out that,
                    despite what you might think,
                    smoked whitefish in an omelette is
                    delicious, even if covered in a
                    thick layer of pepper.
          
                              PETER
                    But for a whole year?
          
                                CARL
                    You don't   understand. I got
                    promoted.    Do you know how long
                    I've been   waiting for some kind of
                    financial   step forward? I said
                    `yes' and   it arrived.
          
                              PETER
                    Well, someone sounds like they're
                    yuppifying their life.
          
                              CARL
                    Excuse me for wanting an appliance
                    in my kitchen besides a hot pot.
          
                                                         45.
          
          
          
                              PETER
                    There's no way you can do this for
                    a whole year.
          
                              CARL
                    That's where you come in.   You're
                    my "Yesponsor."
          
                                 PETER
                    Yesponsor?
          
                              CARL
                    Like in AA. I need you to hold me
                    to it.
          
                              PETER
                    You aren't going to last for more
                    than a week.
          
                              CARL
                    I look forward to proving you
                    wrong.
          
          Peter and Carl shake hands.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Nice suit. If I move up anymore at
                    the bank, I might need a few.
          
                              PETER
                    Cavalli. Silk and cotton blend.
                    Seven fifty.
          
          Lucy comes over and kisses Peter.
          
                              LUCY
                    My girlfriends are being such
                    bitches. It's been two weeks and
                    no one's offered to throw me a
                    wedding shower.
          
                              PETER
                    That's too bad. I'm sure someone
                    will offer.
          
                              LUCY
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    Hey, you want to throw my wedding
                    shower?
          
          Peter turns to Carl, smiling.
          
                                                                     46.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                        (dreading it)
                    I'd be happy to.
          
                              LUCY
                    I was kidding. Wedding showers are
                    thrown by girls.
          
                              CARL
                    That's sexist. Please.      I insist.
          
                                LUCY
                    Thanks.    That means a lot to me.
          
          Lucy hugs Carl. Carl looks over Lucy's shoulder at Peter and
          shakes his head. Rooney comes over.
          
                              ROONEY
                    That was some good times last
                    night. You back for more?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              ROONEY
                    I've got no cash. You mind
                    spotting me and my buddies?
          
          Rooney points to FOUR BARFLIES sitting at the bar.
          
                              PETER
                    Sorry, didn't bring my wallet.
          
          Peter turns to Carl.
          
                                 CARL
                           (BEGRUDGINGLY)
                    Yes.
          
          Carl walks up to the bar.     Peter's snickering behind him.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    What kind of beer do you guys want?
          
                               ROONEY'S FRIENDS/ROONEY
                    As long as you're buying, I want a
                    Grey Goose straight up./Kir
                    Royale/Whatever's in that dusty
                    bottle back there that you never
                    take down.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Carl wakes up.   He looks at the tattooed "Yes" on his hand.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl goes through a series of junk mail flyers for credit
          cards. He VERY CAREFULLY fills each one of them out.
          
          
          INT. DUNKIN DONUTS
          
          Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.    Before the cashier can say
          anything...
          
                              CARL
                    Black coffee, large.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Would you like...
          
                              CARL
                        (cutting her off)
                    To have a wonderful day?    I would.
          
          Carl turns to see a giant poster with the words "DO YOU WANT
          A MOCHA CARAMEL COOLATA?" Carl turns back to the cashier.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                        (RESIGNED)
                    And could I also have a Mocha
                    Caramel Coolata.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    With whipped cream?
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee
          drink and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee and
          wordlessly takes a flier.
          
                              RENEE
                    Hey, give that back.    You already
                    took one.
          
                              CARL
                    What's the hurt in taking another?
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    Destroys the Earth. Also, they
                    cost me ten cents a copy. Besides,
                    are you even going to come?
          
                                 CARL
                    Of course.     I couldn't say `no.'
          
          As he walks away...
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Even if I wanted to.
          
                              RENEE
                    See you tonight, Carl!
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK
          
          Carl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email. In the
          background, we see various SUPER HAPPY EMPLOYEES eating the
          Dunkin Donuts that Carl has brought. We see on the screen
          another email from the King of Nigeria.
          
                              CARL
                    Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I
                    would love to help you anyway I can
                    with your confidential transaction.
                    Please let me know what I can do.
                    Yours, Carl Kendall.
          
          He checks the next email.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Would I like Viagra? Yes, I would.
          
          Carl writes back to the Viagra. ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: The
          next email is from PERSIANWIFEFINDER.COM.
          
                              CARL (cont'd) (CONT'D)
                    Do I want a Persian wife? Perhaps
                    I do.
          
          Carl clicks onto the Persianwifefinder.com and starts
          uploading his profile. Norman walks by.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Norman, would you say I prefer
                    Iranian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or
                    no preference?
          
                                                                  49.

          Carl's reading his email when a HIGH SCHOOL GIRL sits down.
          
                              HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
                    You Carl Kendall?
          
                              CARL
                    Yeah.
          
                              HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
                    I hear that you do small loans.
          
                              CARL
                    Where did you hear that?
          
                              HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
                    Marge. The lady my mom buys her
                    beanie babies from.
          
                              CARL
                    I told her not to say anything.
          
                              HIGH SCHOOL GIRL
                    I only need five hundred bucks.
                    I'm starting college next year and
                    I need it for books. I can't
                    afford them now but I can pay them
                    off over the course of the year.
          
          Carl looks to make sure Norman's not around then he stamps
          her form.
          
                              HIGH SCHOOL GIRL (cont'd)
                    Thank you so much, Mr. Kendall.

          Carl walks down the street, taking fliers from anyone who
          passes them out. We do QUICK CUTS of him with various people
          as he walks down the street.

          Carl's sitting in a Korean class with several businessmen.

          INT. THE NOTE BAR AND PERFORMANCE SPACE - NIGHT
          
          Carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar,
          nursing a beer. There's a makeshift stage at the front of
          the bar. "The Flying Buttresses" are setting up their
          equipment, including a giant clear plastic harp. Renee steps
          up to the microphone.
          
                              RENEE
                    Hello Jake, Penelope, Carl and
                    Rodrigo. We are the Flying
                    Buttresses!
          
          Their four audience members cheer. The drummer bangs his
          sticks together and the band launches in. They are terrible.
          Like really terrible. Renee sings in a high-pitched voice
          that she probably thinks sounds like Tori Amos, but sounds
          more like a dog whistle. If you've heard the singer, Joanna
          Newsom, well that's who she's emulating.

                    play/Among lingonberry fields/They
                    silently bay/The king has no
                    crown/Just a vest of grass/The
                    queen loves the Jester/The Jester
                    has the last laugh.
                        (CHORUS)
                    You are my minotaur/With your
                    cloven hooves!/Half man, half
                    horse/You are all boy to me
          
          Carl looks at the three other audience members. They are
          nodding along. Also, one of them is dressed like a Court
          Jester.
          
          CUT TO LATER
          
          Renee's whisper singing.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    A witches cauldron/burns hot as
                    hell/As her crooked hand/Brews a
                    love spell.
          
          CUT TO LATER
          
          Renee's singing a power ballad.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    I! Am!   A! Fairy!/I! Like!    To
                    Fly!
          
          The four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes.
          Renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates.
          Carl, not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he
          just witnessed, claps along. Renee gets off the stage and
          walks over to the bar, right next to Carl.
          
                              BARTENDER
                    Nice, show Renee. One virgin mint
                    soda coming right up.
          
                              RENEE
                    I don't think I hit a high enough
                    octave in Fairy Dream Song.
          
                              CARL
                    I disagree. I think you hit some
                    pretty high octaves.
          
                              RENEE
                    But I can hit like way higher.
                        (as she speaks her voice
                         goes higher and higher)
                    Like check this out. I think this
                    tone might be more appropriate for
                    my water nymph song?
          
                              CARL
                        (speaking in a low voice)
                    I don't know -- I've known some
                    water nymphs with big balls.
                        (no reaction)
                    From the high level of
                    testosterone.
          
          An awkward moment where Renee doesn't react and Carl thinks
          he may have offended her. Suddenly she starts laughing
          spazzily hard. Carl smiles.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    I've got to write a song about
                    that. I could call it...
          
                              CARL
                    "Big Balled Water Nymph"?       It's a
                    working title.
          
                                 RENEE
                    I like it.     I can work with that.
          
          The drummer, a guy named LEEORE, shouts down to Renee from
          the stage.
          
                               LEEORE
                    Um, excuse me, but we have to clear
                    the stage.
          
                              RENEE
                    I gotta clear.
                        (JOKING)
                    Unless of course, you want to help?
          
                               CARL
                    Sure.   I love clearing stages.
          
          Carl helps a surprised Renee clear the stage.
          
          
          EXT. THE NOTE BAR AND GRILL
          
          Carl has helped Renee fit the giant harp into the back of her
          ancient Volvo.
          
                              RENEE
                    Well, thanks for coming, Carl.      I
                    must bid good night.
          
                                 CARL
                    So early?     It's only 8:00?
          
                              RENEE
                    I lead a jogging, photo group for
                    people who want to both exercise
                    and practice photography.
          
                              CARL
                    You're a photographer too?
          
                              RENEE
                    Amateur, but yeah.    I show every
                    Friday.

                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    If you want to do some artistic
                    calisthenics join us tomorrow.
          
                              CARL
                    What time do you leave?
          
                               RENEE
                    Five.   So we can see the sunrise.
          
                              CARL
                    Wow. I haven't seen the sunrise
                    maybe ever.
                        (RESIGNED)
                    I guess now I'll be doing that
                    tomorrow.
          
                              RENEE
                    Oh, it's beautiful. Makes great
                    photos. Nice meeting you, Carl.
          
          Renee gets in her Volvo and drives off.      Carl walks off.
          
                              FLIER GUY
                    You interested in learning Spanish?
          
          Carl takes the flier from the Flier Guy.
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl walks down the street, now holding a zillion fliers.
          Carl gets a tap on the shoulder. REVEAL Kath standing there.
          
                              KATH (O.S.)
                    Thinking of learning a couple
                    foreign languages?
          
                              CARL
                    Hey, Kath. Would you like one?
                    I'm going to learn Swahili.
          
                              KATH
                    Maybe next week. There's someone
                    you should probably meet. Carl,
                    this is Seb.
          
          A very tall, very blond, Nordic looking man approaches Carl.
          
                                CARL
                    Seb?    What is that?   Swedish?
          
                                SEB
                    Yes.
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
          Beat. Seb puts his hand on Kath's back.   Carl notices this
          and is not particularly happy.
          
                              SEB (cont'd)
                    I've heard a lot about you, Carl.
          
          Seb's phone rings.
          
                              SEB (cont'd)
                    Sorry, sweetie. I've got to take
                    this.
          
          Seb walks off and answers his cell.
          
                              CARL
                    You're on a date then?
          
                               KATH
                    Yeah.   Met him at my firm.
          
                              CARL
                    He's very tall.
          
                              KATH
                    I guess so, yeah.
          
          Seb returns.
          
                              CARL
                    Well, it was nice meeting you, Seb.
                    So I'll be going.
          
          Carl starts to walk off.
          
                              SEB
                    Unless... you'd like to join us?
          
          Carl stops in his tracks. He mouths the word "fuck." Carl
          turns. Kath nods at Carl as in, "You don't have to join us."
          
                              SEB (cont'd)
                    It was good meeting you --
          
                              CARL
                    I'd love to. Join you guys.
          
                               KATH
                    What?
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Seb, Carl and Kath are sitting at dinner. It is incredibly
          awkward. Kath and Seb are clearly incredibly pissed off.
          
                              CARL
                    So, how did you guys meet?
          
                              KATH
                    I told you. Through the firm.
          
          A waiter arrives.
          
                              WAITER
                    Would you like to order some wine?
          
                              KATH/CARL/SEB
                    Yes.
          
          CUT TO LATER -- Carl, Kath and Seb are now slightly drunk.
          However, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk.
          They are still sitting in silence. Seb turns to Kath and
          starts saying something quietly to her.
          
                              CARL
                    Oh, this is good.
                        (CHUCKLING)
                    I was walking past Pizza Hut the
                    other day, and for a second I was
                    sure the sign said "Pizza Hat."
                    And then I thought, wouldn't it be
                    funny if there was a shop that sold
                    hats shaped like pizzas?
                        (beat, weakly)
                    You know. Because it sounds like
                    "Pizza Hut" only it's a hat shop.
          
                              SEB
                    Look, Carl, why don't you just eat
                    your fish and fuck off?
          
          Carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the
          table and walks out of the restaurant. As he leaves, he
          smiles to himself. His phone rings. He sees it's Rooney on
          the Caller ID.
          
                              CARL
                    Shit.
          
          Carl answers the phone.
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          
                              ROONEY (O.S.)
                    What's up Carl? It's Rooney!      What
                    do you say we grab a couple
                    brewskis?
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
          
          Carl flips on his computer. He's trashed.     He has a bunch of
          emails. He clicks on the email.
          
                                NIGERIAN KING (V.O.)
                    Dear   brother Carl, Thank you for
                    your   last note you sent me. But we
                    must   move quickly. I must have
                    your   bank details right now. Send
                    them   to me. Your Associate, Omar,
                    King   of Nigeria
          
                              CARL
                        (while typing)
                    Dear Omar, While I appreciate the
                    gravity of your situation, perhaps
                    a goodwill branch is in order.
                    Could you perhaps loan me a million
                    and take it out of my final cut?
                    Then I will happily send you my
                    bank details. Sincerely, Carl.
          
          Carl then flips on persianwifefinder.com.    A PERSIAN CARTOON
          GENIE comes onto the screen.
          
                              PERSIAN CARTOON GENIE
                    Sa'laam, Carl. You have sixty-five
                    winks. Allah Akbar.
          
          The screen is suddenly filled with pictures of Persian women.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
          
          Carl's alarm goes off. Carl hits it and sits up. He grabs
          his head and then runs to the bathroom and throws up.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - PRE-DAWN
          
          Renee, along with several other amateur photographers in
          sweat suits, have gathered. They all have big cameras around
          their necks. Carl walks up to them. He does not look good.
          
                              CARL
                    Good morning.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
                                 RENEE
                    Wow.     You look tired.
          
                              CARL
                    Well, it is five in the morning.
          
                              RENEE
                    Mammals are meant to be up at dawn.
                    It's how we're built biologically.
                    Where's your camera?
          
          Carl realizes he forgot his camera.
          
                              CARL
                    I thought I'd use my phone.
          
          Carl pulls out his camera cell phone.
          
                              RENEE
                    Awesome idea. So light.
          
                              CARL
                    That's what I thought.
          
                              RENEE
                    Let's hit it.
          
          Renee, Carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers
          start jogging. Carl can barely keep up with them.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Oooh, pretty.
          
          As she passes a flower, Renee snaps a photo of it.
          
          
          EXT. LAKE - DAWN
          
          The group reaches the lake as the sun rises. They all snap
          photos. Carl finds himself snapping photos on his camera.
          He accidentally snaps one of Renee with the sun behind her.
          She looks pretty in the photo.
          
                                RENEE
                    Alright!    Enough standing around!
          
          Renee starts jogging again. Carl starts after her and then
          abruptly doubles over and throws up on the ground. Renee and
          the other jogging/photographers snap photos of him.
          
                                                          58.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CAFE - MORNING
          
          Carl sits across from an Iranian women.
          
                              IRANIAN WOMAN
                    It was delightful meeting you,
                    Carl.
          
                              CARL
                    As it was meeting you Farinoush.
          
                              IRANIAN WOMAN
                    Although I must say I was surprised
                    to discover that you are in no way
                    Persian. Nor are you six foot two.
                    You should change that on your
                    profile.
          
                                CARL
                    Will do.    Should I call you?
          
                              IRANIAN WOMAN
                    Sorry, I want a tall guy.
          
          The Iranian Woman leaves, passing Lucy.
          
                              LUCY
                    Who was that?
          
                              CARL
                    Farinoush Azzam. Great girl, but I
                    don't think we're right for each
                    other.
          
                              LUCY
                    How'd you meet?
          
                              CARL

                        (ignoring her odd look)
                    Let's talk wedding shower.
          
                              LUCY
                    So, I know it's just a wedding
                    shower, so who cares really?
                    And it's like so lame? But I've
                    made an appointment at a stationery
                    store. Are you going to totally
                    kill me?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                        (dripping with sarcasm)
                    You kidding? I love stationery.
          
          Lucy gets up.   Carl follows her.   He does not look happy.
          
          
          INT. STATIONERY STORE - LATER
          
          Lucy and Carl are looking over a book of stationery with the
          STATIONERY PROPRIETESS. Carl can't concentrate.
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    This one is nice. I especially
                    love it in cream.
          
                              LUCY
                    Ooooh, pretty. What do you think?
          
                              CARL
                    Looks good to me.
          
                              LUCY
                        (sarcastic annoyance)
                    Thanks for your opinion.
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    It's always difficult to get the
                    husband-to-be's opinion.
          
                              LUCY
                        (derisive laughter)
                    I'm not marrying him.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm just helping throw the shower.
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    Oh. What's the party going to be
                    like? Sometimes it helps to know
                    that before you pick an invitation.
          
                              LUCY
                    Nothing special. Just hors
                    d'oeuvres and wine.
          
          Carl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations.
          
                              CARL
                    Look at this -- Bridal Bingo.
                    What's Bridal Bingo?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    It's bingo, except you yell out
                    embarrassing facts about the bride
                    and whoever fills their card first
                    wins.
          
                              CARL
                    That sounds fun.
          
                              LUCY
                    I'm not doing Bridal Bingo.
          
                              CARL
                    How about a calendar shower?
          
                              LUCY
                    Can we concentrate at the task at
                    hand?
          
                              CARL
                    Do you even know what a calendar
                    shower is? Maybe a calendar shower
                    is awesome.
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    Every guest gets assigned a month
                    and brings a gift that the bride
                    and groom can use during that
                    month.
          
                              LUCY
                    That's kind of cute.
          
                              CARL
                    I think that's really cute.
          
          Carl's starting to get really into it. He turns the page and
          sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "Knights in
          White Armor."
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Look at this one -- "Knights in
                    White Armor."
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    The bride and groom ride in on a
                    white stallion.
          
                              CARL
                    You have got to do that.   Like it's
                    not even a choice.
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          
                              LUCY
                    That seems a little extreme.
          
                              CARL
                    You only get married once.
          
                              STATIONERY PROPRIETESS
                    Your friend happens to be right.
          
                              LUCY
                    You're really good at this. You
                    mind helping me with the wedding
                    invitations?
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK
          
          Carl's sitting across from an Arab Guy at the loan desk.
          
                              ARAB GUY
                    I love cell phones. I breathe cell
                    phones. I own, myself, thirty-five
                    cell phones. My brother is an
                    idiot and he's selling cell phones
                    hand over fist. What do you have?
                    A Nokia 9850?
          
          The Arab Guy goes to grab Carl's phone.   He sees the photo of
          Renee on the phone's wallpaper.
          
                              ARAB GUY (cont'd)
                    Oooh, pretty lady.
          
          Carl grabs his phone back.
          
                              CARL
                    How much do you need?
          
                              ARAB GUY
                    Eighty five hundred.

                    I was with my sister? And we had

          Carl stamps his form.    Norman comes over.
          
                              NORMAN
                    May I speak to you, Carl?
          
          
          INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE
          
          Norman sits across from Carl.

                    I know what you're doing.
          
                              CARL
                    What am I doing?
          
                              NORMAN
                    You're loaning below our minimum.
          
          Carl doesn't know what to say.
          
                              NORMAN (cont'd)
                    You thought I wouldn't notice the
                    paperwork? I'm not the regional
                    manager because I ignore the
                    details.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if
                    you need a small amount of money
                    you have to go to a loan shark.
                    Only rich people can pay back loans
                    over ten grand. A bank's job is
                    not to just help the rich. It's to

                    I know. These microloans are
                    pretty interesting. So I'll you
                    spearhead a little pilot program at
                    the bank.

                              ROONEY
                    I don't. I was wondering if you
                    were around tonight to help me
                    move?

                              ROONEY
                    Because it's cheaper to ask you.

          MOMENTS LATER Carl is carrying the fridge down the stairs.
          He FALLS down the stairs with the fridge. Carl looks up at
          Rooney who's at the top of the stairs.
          
                                 ROONEY

                              ROONEY
                    I wish I could, but I hurt my back
                    trying to move that fridge.

                    Sure.
          
          Tony instantly pulls out candles and lights them.
          
                              CARL
                    How about wine?       Like a bottle of

          Tony pulls out a bottle of wine and two glasses.     Tony goes
          in to kiss Carl.

                              CARL
                    It's a swinging door!

                    He asked me to join them.

                    I think you're taking this too far.
          
                              CARL
                    I have no choice. I'm a yes man.
                    I must say yes. If Seb asks me to
                    join them on their date, I must.
                    If some dude asks me for a loan I
                    have to give it to them even if
                    it's clearly never going to be paid
                    back. If a guy asks me into his
                    bedroom, I must hook up with him.
          
                              PETER
                    You hooked up with a dude?
          
                              CARL
                    It's like hooking up with a strong
                    woman. I honestly don't see what
                    the big deal is.
                        (back on his yes rant)
                    I am guided by yes. Yes has become
                    my superpower. And let me tell,
                    yes is turning out to be a pretty
                    sweet deal. Now if you'll excuse
                    me I'm late for Korean class.
          
                              PETER
                    You hate Korean food.
          
                              CARL
                    That's no reason to write off an
                    entire, vibrant culture. See you
                    later, buddy.
          
          Carl heads off, the kitten under his arm.
          
          
          INT. GALLERY
          
          Carl walks around a photography gallery. Renee's photos are
          up. They are terrible photos, since they were taken while
          she was jogging. Their subjects are blurry. Some of them
          are half in the photo and half out. The featured photo is of
          Carl throwing up on the ground.
          
                                                                  70.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    You really are displaying that.
          
                              RENEE
                    That's probably my best photo ever.
                    My collages aren't bad. But
                    personally, I think I excel at
                    pottery.
          
          Renee POINTS to a LARGE, BROWN PLATE that looks like poo.
          
                              CARL
                    Wow. That's really big. How do
                    you have time for all this stuff?
          
                              RENEE
                    How do you have time to come to
                    every one of my rocks shows even
                    the one in Fairfield county that
                    was seventy-five miles from here?
                    I almost skipped that one.
          
                              CARL
                    You gave me the flier, so I had to
                    go.
          
                              RENEE
                    At first I thought you were a weird
                    stalker and I was scared. But now
                    I think you're just a really shy
                    dude with a crush. And while it's
                    been suspenseful to see when/if
                    you'd ask me out --
          
                              CARL
                    Do you want to go out sometime?
          
                              RENEE
                    Yes, I would.
          
                              CARL
                    By the way, I do other stuff
                    besides follow you around.
          
                                 RENEE
                    Like what?
          
                              CARL
                    I take Korean.
          
                              RENEE
                    In that case, what do you say we do
                    Korean?
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
          
          INT. KOREAN RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Carl's eating across from Renee. He can't stand the food.
          He grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down.
          
                              RENEE
                    Do you want any more squid hot pot?
                    It's really good here.
          
                              CARL
                    I think I'm good.   To have some
                    more.
          
          Renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    So, all this art you create.   What
                    do you want to do with it?
          
                              RENEE
                    What do you mean?
          
                              CARL
                    Like, do you want to open a store?
          
                              RENEE
                    Where I can sell my photos and
                    pottery? Of course not. They're
                    terrible.
          
          Carl's surprised that she knows this.
          
                              CARL
                    They're not terrible.
          
                              RENEE
                    Yeah, they're awful.
          
                              CARL
                    I think you're being hard on
                    yourself --
          
                              RENEE
                    I'm not asking for sympathy. My
                    voice is way too high-pitched, my
                    pottery looks like poo, and my
                    photos are blurry and subjectless.
                    But who gives a shit? Not
                    everything needs a goal. The world
                    is a playground. You know that as
                    a kid but then somewhere along the
                    way everyone forgets.

                                                 72.
          
                       RENEE (cont'd)
              (as if    telling a secret)
          Besides, I    can't open a store. My
          big master    plan is to take a trip
          around the    world.
          
                     CARL
          When?   Like in a couple years?
          
                    RENEE
          I bought a ticket for four months
          from now.
          
                    CARL
          People always talk about that, but
          you're actually doing it.
          
                     RENEE
          Honestly, I'm terrified.
              (THEN)
          How about you? Do you like the
          bank?
          
                    CARL
          It's lame, but you know, it's
          pretty funny. My boss Norman
          always throws theme parties.
          
                    RENEE
          So if it's lame why do you work
          there?
          
                    CARL
          Because... it's actually not lame.
              (REALIZING)
          I just gave the answer I've
          automatically given for years. I'm
          actually enjoying the bank for the
          first time maybe ever. I started
          this pilot program that gives out
          microloans.
          
                    RENEE
          What's that?
          
                    CARL
          Like say you need three hundred
          bucks to pay for paint so you can
          start a house painting business.
          Rather than paying a loan shark who
          charges you 300%, now you can come
          to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's
          kind of dorky.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    That actually sounds really cool.
          
          The waitress comes over.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    I'm stuffed. But I would love to
                    wrap this up.
          
                              CARL

                         SUBTITLES)
                    [We are very fat. But can I please
                    have this food made mobile?]
          
                              RENEE
                    So, what do you say we hit this
                    crazy party?
          
                              CARL
                    Funny, not crazy.    My boss is white
                    noise.
          
                              RENEE
                    White noise?
          
                              CARL
                    You know, like totally boring.
          
                              RENEE
                    I don't know anyone who's totally
                    boring. Crack a person's shell --
                    there's always something creepy
                    underneath.
          
          
          INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Norman opens the door. He's dressed as the Japanese
          character Hiro from the show Heroes.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Carl! Welcome. Or should I say,
                    uerukamu!
          
                              RENEE
                    What's going on?
          
                              CARL
                    I wouldn't bother.
          
                                                            74.
          
          
          
                              NORMAN
                    You didn't tell her? This is a
                    dress-up as your favorite character
                    from Heroes. Do you watch?
          
                              RENEE
                    I currently don't have a
                    television.
          
          Norman stares at her.
          
                              NORMAN
                    I don't know what to do with that
                    information. There are drinks,
                    chips, dips, various and sundry
                    noshes. I entreat you to make
                    friends. Let's get this party
                    started!
          
          
          INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT
          
          It's very quiet.    A couple people mill about.
          
                              CARL
                    We don't have to stay long.
          
                              RENEE
                    It's a party. Let's socialize.
          
          Carl and Renee walk up to a MOUSEY GIRL.
          
                                 CARL
                    I'm Carl.     This is Renee.
          
                                 KHATOON
                    Hey.     I'm Khatoon.
          
          It's complete silence.    Beat.
          
                              KHATOON (cont'd)
                    Do I know you from somewhere?
          
                              CARL
                    I don't think so.
          
                              KHATOON
                    Are you listed on
                    Persianwifefinder.com?
          
          Renee laughs.    Carl fake laughs with her.
          
                                                                      75.
          
          
          
                              KHATOON (cont'd)
                    Seriously, though, are you?
          
                              CARL
                    So, how do you know Norman?
          
                              KHATOON
                    Karate Club.
          
          Norman comes in with more chips.   There are now about ten
          times as many snacks as guests.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Baked Lays people!   It is on!
          
                              CARL
                    You're in a karate club?
          
          
          INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT
          
          Everyone's standing around Norman. They've laid several
          pieces of wood out over a coffee table.
          
                                PARTY GUESTS
                    Norman!    Norman! Norman!
          
          Norman KARATE CHOPS the wood in half.   The guests cheer.
          Norman takes a big bow.

                    Told ya there was something weird
                    under that white noise shell.
          
          Renee leaves Carl.
          
                              KHATOON
                    You're totally on
                    persianwifefinder.com.   SultanCarl.
          
          Carl turns to Norman.
          
                              CARL
                        (changing the subject)
                    Khatoon, Norman! You guys should
                    spar!
          
          Khatoon and Norman start to spar. Carl sits back, smiling.
          JASON, a cynical guy who's slightly drunk, sidles up beside
          Carl.
          
                                                           76.
          
          
          
                              JASON
                    Well, isn't that cute? We've got a
                    full match on. Hey, I'm Jason.
          
          They shake hands.
          
                                CARL
                    I'm Carl.    What do you do?
          
                              JASON
                    Work for the INS.
          
                                CARL
                    Cool.
          
                              JASON
                    I hate it. Everyday I have to dash
                    some poor guy's dream. I'm a
                    professional dream dasher.
          
                              CARL
                    It can't be that bad.
          
                              JASON
                    The other day, I turned down a guy
                    who had literally been a professor
                    at the University of Cuba.
          
          FLASHBACK OF JASON'S INS OFFICE
          
          Jason's sitting across from a CUBAN PROFESSOR.
          
                              CUBAN PROFESSOR
                    What? But I've already lived here
                    for five years. I've received a
                    steady paycheck and paid taxes for
                    five years. I speak fluent
                    English. I can't go back.
          
                              JASON
                    I'm sorry but no can do.
          
                               CUBAN PROFESSOR
                    I've passed the citizenship test
                    ten times. I bet you couldn't pass
                    that test.
          
                              JASON
                    You're probably right.
          
                              CUBAN PROFESSOR
                    Do you know the location of the
                    Spanish-American war?
          
                                                             77.

                     Spain?
          
                                  CUBAN PROFESSOR
                     No.
          
                                  JASON
                     America?
          
                                  CUBAN PROFESSOR
                     No.
          
                               JASON

                     Spainerica?
          
                               CUBAN PROFESSOR
                     You are an insult to your country.
          
          BACK TO THE PARTY.
          
                               CARL
                     So did you let him in?
          
                               JASON
                     I sent him back to Cuba.       I send
                     them all back.
          
                               CARL
                     If you hate your job so much, why
                     do you do it?
          
                               JASON
                     Because I have to eat.
          
                               CARL
                         (to himself, in wonder)
                     You're a no man.
          
                                  JASON
                     Excuse me?
          
          Beat.   Carl makes a difficult decision.
          
                               CARL
                         (WHISPERING)
                     I'm not supposed to tell anyone
                     this except for my Yesponsor, but
                     you can change your life. I've
                     changed mine. If I tell you how,
                     will you promise not to tell
                     anyone?
          
                                                                   78.
          
          
          
                               JASON
                        (sarcastically whispering
                         BACK)
                    Yeah, sure, whatever.
          
                              CARL
                    I say yes. To everything.    Say Yes
                    More. It's that simple.
          
          Dramatic beat.   Jason finishes his drink.
          
                              JASON
                    That's the most retarded idea I've
                    ever heard.
          
          Jason heads off.   Renee returns.
          
                              RENEE
                    What did I miss?
          
                              CARL
                        (THROWN)
                    Nothing. Do you want to go?
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl and Renee walk into Carl's apartment. Ten kittens and
          puppies come running up to them as they enter.
          
                              RENEE
                    You work for the ASPCA?
          
                              CARL
                    I just love pets. This is
                    Veronica, King George, Owen, Carl
                    jr., Carl the III, Carl IV,
                    Bubbles, Greedo, Cat 1, Cat 2 and
                    Cat 3. At the end there, I got
                    kind of bored of naming them.
          
          They walk into Carl's living room/bedroom.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM
          
          The room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes.   Renee starts
          to go through the boxes.
          
                              CARL
                    You don't need to do that.
          
                                                                   79.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    You have a lot of Mexican Viagra.
          
                              CARL
                    I have a congenital heart thing it
                    helps. And it's cheaper than the
                    stuff that's made here.
          
                              RENEE
                    You better not be a criminal.
                    Because one time I dated this guy
                    who jacked cars for a living and I
                    did not enjoy living on the edge as
                    much as I thought I would.
          
                              CARL
                    It's cheaper to buy in bulk.    Is
                    that a crime?
          
                              RENEE
                    A hundred boxes of Mexican
                    prescription drugs borders on
                    something vaguely criminal.
          
          Beat.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Well, are you going to make out
                    with me or what?
          
                              CARL
                    Yes.
          
          Carl grabs Renee and starts making out with her.   They fall
          onto the bed. REVEAL Rooney watching them.
          
                              ROONEY
                    You must be Renee. I have heard so
                    much about you. Can I watch?
          
          Carl doesn't know what to say.   Before he has to say yes...
          
                              RENEE
                    No, you can't watch.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Renee and Carl lie next to each other.
          
                              RENEE
                    You know what I would love?    A
                    massage.
          
                                                                   80.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    I give great massages.
          
          Carl starts massaging her.
          
                               RENEE
                    Oooh.   Yeah. Oooh, right there.
          
          Carl stops.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Don't stop.
          
          Carl continues massaging her.
          
          CHYRON: HALF HOUR LATER
          
          Carl's still massaging her.    He stops.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Can you please keep massaging?
          
          Carl starts massaging again.
          
          CHYRON: AN HOUR LATER
          
          Carl's massaging. His hands are really cramping up.   She's
          asleep. He stops massaging.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                        (while asleep)
                    Please keep massaging, please?
          
          Carl starts massaging again, wincing while he does it.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK
          
          Carl's sitting across from a LARGE MAN. Carl's hands are
          like claws. A line of people waits to speak with him.
          
                              CARL
                    How much does a Schwinn cost?
          
                              LARGE MAN
                    Three hundred fifty three dollars.
                    It'll really help me get my one
                    hour delivery business off the
                    ground. I've tried on foot. I
                    only have a two mile radius.
          
                              CARL
                    Done and done.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          
          Carl stamps the package.      Norman comes over to the loan desk.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Hey, the boys upstairs are here to
                    speak with you.
          
                               CARL
                    Really?   Because I have a thing at
                    one...
          
                              NORMAN
                    He asked for you specifically.
                    Ixnay on the small loans-ay.
          
          Carl looks over. He sees the President (from the beginning
          of the movie) sitting in the conference room. Carl gets
          nervous.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM
          
          Carl walks into the conference room.     The bank president,
          CHRIS PARKER, motions to a seat.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker.
                    President of Southwest Bank.

                    I actually met you when I was just
                    a teller.

                    punching bag day. You've upped
                    walk-in traffic by 35%. Not only
                    that -- you've also taken charge of
                    corporate day care. I like a team
                    player.
          
          Carl's phone buzzes.    The caller ID says LUCY.
          
                                 CARL
                    Thank you.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    But then I got suspicious. What
                    drives a man in his mid to late
                    thirties who's still at the
                    absolute lowest level of our
                    corporate family? Generous
                    helpfulness? Or raging revenge?
          
                              CARL
                    Generous helpfulness?
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Which is when I got the numbers
                    from your loan desk.
          
          Carl turns white. Carl's phone buzzes again.    The text says
          LUCY: "WHERE ARE YOU?"
          
                               CARL
                    Uh huh.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You've given out over 682 below
                    minimum loans. One of them was
                    literally for fifteen dollars and
                    eighty seven cents.
          
                              CARL
                    Janice Peabody's ant farm rental
                    business.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    How do you explain yourself?
          
                              CARL
                    I've started a microloan project.
                    I figure that if someone needs less
                    than ten grand why should they go
                    to a loan shark when they can come
                    to a legitimate banking
                    institution?
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Because the paperwork makes any
                    profit moot. Unless you're raiding
                    our coffers.
          
                               CARL
                    No.   I wouldn't do that.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I would if I could, so why wouldn't
                    you?
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          Chris laughs. Carl laughs. Chris abruptly stops laughing.
          So does Carl. Carl's phone buzzes again. The text says
          LUCY: "I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING AT ONE. PLEASE CALL BACK."
          
                              CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
                    But then I looked closer at the
                    numbers. 85% of the loan
                    recipients have been paying them
                    off according to the bank's
                    schedule. Not just that, but 72%
                    of that group have returned as
                    regular full loan customers. This
                    is both a moneymaker and good for
                    the community. That like never
                    happens!
          
                                 CARL
                    Thank you.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You're the kind of person we want in
                    corporate. We're taking some clients
                    on a golfing trip. You golf?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You free tomorrow?
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Of course you are. I better watch
                    my back around you, Carl Kendall.
                    Soon you'll be taking my job. See
                    you on the links.
          
          Chris Parker grabs Carl's hand and shakes it.   Carl RUNS out
          of the office.
          
          
          EXT. SUGAR DREAMS BAKERY
          
          Carl RUNS up to the bakery.   Lucy's outside.
          
                              LUCY
                    What happened?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm sorry -- bank meeting stuff.
          
                                                                   84.
          
          
          
          
          INT. SUGAR DREAMS BAKERY
          
          Lucy and Carl wander around a fancy bakery.
          
                              LUCY
                    I've never heard of a Wedding
                    Shower cake.
          
                              CARL
                    You have to have one. Modern Bride
                    calls them a necessity.
          
          Carl's phone rings.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Sorry, Luce. Work stuff.
                        (sotto into phone)
                    Yeah, I can definitely be at the
                    blood bank in twenty minutes.
          
          Carl hangs up.   Lucy suddenly starts crying.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    Are you OK?
          
                              LUCY
                    I'm sorry, it's just you've been so
                    great at all this while my husband-
                    to-be has been completely absent.
                    Do you have time to grab a cup of
                    tea?
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE TEA ROOM
          
          Carl and Lucy are each drinking tea.   The only other people
          in the tea room are groups of women.
          
                              LUCY
                    Is he scared to get married?    Is
                    that why he doesn't care?
          
                              CARL
                    You know Peter. He's a man's man.
                    He cares, he just doesn't know how
                    to show it.
          
                              LUCY
                    You know how to show it. A wedding
                    is a huge deal. I'm so scared.
          
                                                         85.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    You guys are perfect for each
                    other.
          
                              LUCY
                    I know that and yet I'm still so
                    scared.
          
                              CARL
                    Maybe if you're just honest with
                    him about how you're feeling it'll
                    be OK.
          
                              LUCY
                    He can be just so closed off.
          
          Carl's phone rings.
          
                              CARL
                    Sorry, the bank, you know?
                        (sotto into phone)
                    The UFO conference is tonight? No,
                    that's fine, I'll definitely be
                    there.
          
          Carl hangs up.
          
                                 CARL (cont'd)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              LUCY
                    You've been so good to me. I've
                    really come to depend on you. I
                    want to pay you back.
          
                              CARL
                    Not necessary.
          
                              LUCY
                    Peter tells me you might have some
                    disposable income these days.
          
                              CARL
                    For some reason, the bank keeps
                    promoting me.
          
                              LUCY
                    If you want to look at some open
                    houses, I'm happy to waive my fee.
          
                                                                       86.
          
          
          
          
          INT. LUXURIOUS APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Carl and Lucy walk into a luxurious apartment. Gourmet
          kitchen, floor to ceiling windows, giant media center.
          
                              LUCY
                    So this is at the very top end of
                    what you could probably afford.
                    Are you interested?
          
          Carl hits a button.    A GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN DESCENDS.
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                              LUCY
                    Are you sure? I mean, this is the
                    first place you've looked --
          
                                CARL
                    Yes.    I've got to run.
          
                              LUCY
                    I'm looking forward to meeting
                    Renee tonight.
          
                                 CARL
                    What?
          
                              LUCY
                    We're all having dinner.    Tonight.
                    Remember?
          
                               CARL
                    Right.   Of course.
          
          Carl runs out.

                    I just think if we're going to be
                    rolling out a no interest financing
                    campaign we should commit hard.
          
          He checks his watch.    The NURSE walks by.

                    Ministry of Defence paid security
                    cleared experts to research UFOs.
                    This classified study was code
                    named Project Condign.
          
          Carl's phone rings. People look angrily at him.    He stands
          and PASSES OUT in the aisle.

                    I'm sorry I'm late.
          
                              RENEE
                    That's fine. It's only the very
                    first time I've met your friends.
          
                              CARL
                    It was work, it went crazy late.
          
          Carl takes a breath.    He's about to pass out.
          
                              RENEE
                    What's with the "They're Out There"
                    and "I Gave" button?
          
          REVEAL Carl's sporting buttons that say "They're Out There"
          and "I Gave."
          
                                                                  88.

                    Long story.
                        (to the hostess)
                    Miss, could I have an orange juice?
                    Like fast?
          
          
          INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Renee, Carl, Kath, Seb, Peter and Lucy sit around a table at
          a nice restaurant. As per usual, Carl has several different
          meals in front of him. He also has a martini, a glass of
          water, and a glass of orange juice. Carl's showing off to
          his friends. As he shows off, Renee looks irritated.
          
                              CARL
                        (showing off, to Peter)
                    Your wife found me a really great
                    place. Built in Bose surround
                    sound, a 100 inch LCD flat screen
                    TV, roof deck with jacuzzi.
          
                              LUCY
                    Least I could do. At least he's
                    involved with our wedding.
          
                              PETER
                        (ignoring Lucy's tone)
                    I likey your suit-ey. Hugo Boss?
          
                              CARL
                    Oh, this old thing?   Prada, I
                    think.
          
                               RENEE
                    You think? We went to three
                    different Prada stores to find the
                    right fit.
          
                              LUCY
                    What do yo do for a living, Renee?
          
                              RENEE
                    I paint. I'm in a band. I do
                    volunteer work at a shelter. I
                    teach ESL. I do balloon animal
                    art. You know, a little of this, a
                    little of that.
          
                              CARL
                    You should check out her pottery.
                    It's really big.
          
                                                                    89.
          
          
          
                                 RENEE
                    It is big.     How about you guys?
          
                              LUCY
                    Real estate broker.
          
                                 PETER/KATH/SEB
                    Lawyer.
          
          Quiet beat.   The conversation's not exactly flowing easily.
          
                              PETER
                    If you'll excuse me.
          
          Peter leaves.   The waiter comes over.
          
                              WAITER
                    Have you made a decision about the
                    wine?
          
                              CARL
                    Well, we're kind of in a
                    celebratory mood.
          
                              WAITER
                    In that case, may I suggest a 97
                    Petit Rothschild?
          
          The Waiter points at a wine that costs $400 a bottle.
          
                              CARL
                    Maybe we should wait for Peter to
                    decide.
          
                              LUCY
                    He doesn't know crap about wine.
                    Just pick one, Carl.
          
          Carl is sweating bullets.
          
                               CARL
                    Why not?   Let's celebrate.
          
                              WAITER
                    With six people, I'd recommend two
                    bottles.
          
          
          INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Everyone's drinking the wine.    Carl's terrified of the bill.
          
                                                                90.
          
          
          
                              LUCY
                    Do you rent or own?
          
                                RENEE
                    I sublet.    I have this corner of a
                    loft.
          
                              CARL
                    It's a really nice corner though.
          
                              LUCY
                    If you're ever interested in
                    buying, you should ring me up.
          
                              RENEE
                    I hate owning things. Because when
                    you own something, you suddenly are
                    invested in that thing not
                    breaking. And I break everything.
                    I've gone through three TVS in
                    three years.
          
                              SEB
                    How did you break them?
          
                              RENEE
                    I smashed one with a hammer,
                    dropped one off my roof and the
                    third one just went on the fritz.
                    So I set it on fire.
          
          Carl's friends don't really know what to say. The check
          comes. Carl grabs it before anyone else can. It's a $1500
          bill. He drops several credit cards down on the table.
          
                              CARL
                    It's on me!
                        (quietly to the waiter)
                    I'd like to split it between an
                    Advanta Blue Business, Mastercard,
                    a Diners Club and my South Dakota
                    Bank Visa Check card.
          
          
          EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT
          
          Carl's outside with Peter.
          
                              PETER
                    Nice job with Renee. She's
                    definitely odd, but that's not
                    necessarily --
          
                                                91.
          
          
          
                    CARL
          I just spent $1500 on dinner.
          
                     PETER
          What?   Why?
          
                    CARL
          Because the waiter asked me if I
          wanted the expensive wine and you
          weren't there to stop me!
          
                    PETER
          Don't get mad at me about it.   You
          can just stop.
          
                    CARL
          No I can't. If I didn't say yes to
          the band flier, I never would have
          met Renee. If I hadn't said yes to
          taking charge of bank day care and
          then yes to becoming a loan
          specialist and then yes to the
          president's golf trip, I wouldn't
          be moving up. Each yes leads to
          the next one. If I stop, it could
          all fall apart.
          
                    PETER
          You've gone from a passive guy who
          always said no to a passive guy who
          always says yes. Just saying yes
          is not a legitimate life
          philosophy.
          
                    CARL
          I don't know why I should be taking
          advice from a guy who's wife is
          pissed he's not involved at all
          with the wedding planning.
          
                    PETER
          I'm involved.
          
                    CARL
          You told her you don't care whether
          the invite's cream or ivory.
          
                    PETER
          I can't see the difference.
              (opening up)
          Honestly, I'm terrified.
          
                                                                      92.
          
          
          
                               CARL
                    What?   Why?
          
                              PETER
                    It's marriage, you know?   The
                    biggest thing ever.
          
                              CARL
                    But you guys have dated for years.
          
                               PETER
                    I know.
          
                              CARL
                    You're perfect for each other.
          
                               PETER
                    I know.
          
                              CARL
                    She's terrified too.
          
                               PETER
                    Really?
          
                              CARL
                    Of course she is. I think you'll
                    both be a lot less terrified if
                    you're terrified together.
          
                              PETER
                    But what if I really can't tell the
                    difference between ivory and cream?
                    Does that make me a bad husband?
          
                              CARL
                    What matters is that you pretend
                    you can see the difference.
          
          The girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their
          coats on. There's a silent beat.
          
                              GIRLS
                        (high pitched goodbyes)
                    It was wonderful meeting you!/I
                    loved it!/Let me know when you
                    throw your next art thing!
          
          Everyone gets into their cars.   Carl and Renee walk off.
          
                              RENEE
                    It was great meeting your friends.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    They're a little stiff.
          
          Beat.
          
                              RENEE
                    They are a little stiff.   What do
                    you feel like doing?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm actually going rollerblading
                    with Ralph.
          
                              RENEE
                    Ralph?
          
                              CARL
                    You know, crazy rollerblading
                    guitar man.
          
                              RENEE
                    The guy who plays at the promenade?
          
                              CARL
                    Any interest?
          
                              RENEE
                    No. It's ten on a Friday night.
                    And that guy's crazy. Don't you
                    want to go home and make out?
          
                              CARL
                    Yes.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl and Renee are making while Carl surreptitiously checks
          his watch. Finally, Renee stops kissing him.
          
                              RENEE
                        (ANNOYED)
                    Just go.
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl and CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN rollerblade down the
          street while guitar man plays guitar.
          
                                                                     94.
          
          
          
                              CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN
                    Which is why the merman is not to
                    be trusted, especially with the
                    fisherman's computer brain.
          
                              CARL
                    That is really good to know.
          
                              CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN
                    You want to come see the merman?

                           (RELUCTANT)
                    Yes.
          
          
          INT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY
          
          Carl dashes in, covered in spots of paint.    Chris appears.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    What happened to you?
          
          FLASHBACK: CHYRON: TEN MINUTES AGO
          
          Carl's playing really intense, terrifying paintball with
          Norman and Rooney.
          
          BACK TO NOW:
          
                              CARL
                    I do this whole Habitat for
                    Humanity Thing.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I love the concept of charity.
                    It's awesome.
          
          A group of KOREAN GENTLEMAN approach Carl and Chris.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
                    This is Carl Kendall. This is Jin
                    Kim, Joo-Chan Park, Soo Lee and
                    Seung Kim. Seung's the CEO of
                    Korean Bank International.
          
          The Koreans shake Carl's hand.
          
                              CARL
                        (in Korean, with
                         SUBTITLES)
                    [It is an honor to meet you.   Do
                    you like America?]
          
                                                                   95.
          
          
          
          The Koreans all start speaking Korean at Carl.   Carl clearly
          doesn't understand what they're saying.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRY CLUB
          
          Chris and Carl follow the Koreans.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You speak Korean?
          
                              CARL
                    Just a little.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You sneaky devil. I knew I should
                    watch my back around you.
          
                              CARL
                    Is it a problem if I've never
                    played golf before?
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You're a funny one, Carl Kendall.
                    Remember, they have to win. In
                    Asian cultures, there's a concept
                    called Saving Face. You have to
                    let them win. But if they smell
                    for a second that you haven't tried
                    your hardest, they'll commit hari
                    kari.
          
                              CARL
                    Metaphorically?
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Who knows? It's a delicate
                    balance, Kendall. Like two little
                    girls on a see saw with a crocodile
                    beneath them. Make the wrong move,
                    and the little girl will end up in
                    the croc's maw.
          
          
          EXT. GOLF COURSE
          
          Carl stands with the Koreans. Seung Kim is speaking very
          rapidly at Carl. Carl has no idea what he's saying. Seung
          Kim laughs. Carl laughs along with him. Chris hits a
          beautiful shot. His ball lands almost on the green. The
          Koreans notice and nervously chatter. Chris approaches Carl.
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Alright, buddy. It's all you.
          
          Carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag.    Everyone seems
          very impressed.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
                    You must have quite a powerful
                    stroke.
          
                              CARL
                    I do.
          
                              SEUNG KIM
                        (in Korean, to Carl)
                    [Good luck, my friend.]
          
                              CARL
                        (in Korean)
                    [I shall need the luck.    This is my
                    first time playing.]
          
          Seung Kim laughs.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                        (under his breath)
                    Why does everyone think I'm joking?
          
          Carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee.    He looks
          towards the hole.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                    That's really far.
          
          Carl lines up his shot. He swings back, then forward, and
          PLOWS the club into the grass, knocking the ball off the tee.
          The ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple
          feet from where Carl hit it.
          
                              CARL (cont'd)
                        (in Korean, to Seung Kim)
                    [You're up, Seung Kim.]
          
          Carl walks back to where Chris is at.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    What was that?
          
                              CARL
                    Just keeping them on their toes.
                    Reverse psychology. Tiger Woods
                    does it.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
          
          Seung Kim raises his club back. He too dubs it, driving the
          club deep into the grass. His ball rolls just a couple feet
          past Carl.
          
          GOLF MONTAGE WHEREIN CARL AND SEUNG KIM COMPETE TO NOT BE THE
          ABSOLUTE WORST GOLF PLAYER EVER
          
          -- Carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees.
          
          -- Seung Kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately
          taps his ball right into the pond.
          
          -- Carl keeps divoting the grass. He divots so many times
          that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's
          accidentally dug.
          
          -- Seung Kim hits his ball out of the sand trap. It rolls
          back in. He tries again. It rolls back in. He's about to
          try again when Carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the
          lip of the sand trap. Carl holds his finger up to his lips:
          "Shhh."
          
          -- Carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings.   He
          answers it.
          
                                CARL (cont'd)
                      Of course not.
          
          The other golfers look really impatient.
          
                                 CARL (cont'd)
                      Male.

          Carl holds up his finger.   Only one moment.
          
          
          -- It's   getting late. Now both Carl and Seung Kim are
          hitting   their balls at once to save time. They are both
          running   and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if
          they're   playing a deranged game of field hockey.
          
          
          EXT. GOLF COURSE - EARLY EVENING
          
          Carl is counting up the scores.
          
                                                                 98.
          
          
          
                               CARL
                     Chris, you hit a 90.   Nice one.
          
                               CHRIS PARKER
                     I bogied the fifth hole.   I'm still
                     pissed about that.
          
                               CARL
                     Joo-Chan hit a 95. Nice work.      As
                     for Seung Kim. You hit 453.
          
          Seung glowers at Carl.
          
                               CARL (cont'd)
                     And as for me, I hit...
                         (doing some computations)
                     ... 503.
          
                                SEUNG KIM
                     Yes!
          
          Seung Kim pumps his fist.
          
                               CARL
                     I'm sorry to say that team Korean
                     Bank International has won.
          
          Seung Kim slaps five with his compatriots.
          
          
          INT. COUNTRY CLUB - POST GOLF
          
          Carl, Chris and the Koreans are all hanging out. Carl is
          alone in the corner of the conference hall. A PRETTY FEMALE
          KOREAN BANKER approaches Carl.
          
                               PRETTY KOREAN BANKER
                         (in Korean)
                     [You are quite the golfer.]
          
                               CARL
                         (in Korean)
                     [I golf from crotch noodle.]
          
          Beat.   She laughs.   He laughs along with her.
          
                               PRETTY KOREAN BANKER
                         (in Korean)
                     [I have a business proposition for
                     you. My marriage is not a happy
                     one. I often find my needs are
                     left unsatisfied.]
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                        (in Korean)
                    [I agree. The weather is sunny.]
          
                              PRETTY KOREAN BANKER
                        (in Korean)
                    [I wish that was so.]
                        (in English)
                    Kiss me? Please?
          
          Carl doesn't know what to do.
          
                                 CARL
                           (NERVOUSLY)
                    Yes.
          
          She kisses him passionately.    Carl breaks away from the kiss.
          
                              PRETTY KOREAN BANKER
                    Am I not sexy? Have you not heard
                    of saving face?
          
                              CARL
                    You're very sexy.
          
          Carl and the Korean Banker kiss more.   Carl looks guilty.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRY CLUB
          
          Carl's shaking hands with the Korean Bank Representatives.
          Chris shakes Carl's hand.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I'm promoting you to bank manager.
                        (pulling Carl close)
                    I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't
                    you forget it.
          
          Chris laughs. Carl nervously laughs along with him. The
          Pretty Korean Banker walks by and waves at him. Carl waves
          back. He looks very guilty.
          
          
          INT. POTTERY STUDIO
          
          Carl walks into the pottery studio, looking guilty.   Renee is
          making a giant piece of pottery.
          
                              RENEE
                    What's up, chicken butt?
                        (off his guilty look)

                                                                 100.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Are you OK? Did everything go OK
                    at golf?
          
          Carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss.
          
                              CARL
                    I just got promoted to bank
                    manager.
          
                              RENEE
                    Congratulations!
          
          Renee kisses Carl.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    Oooh, we should do some sexy
                    pottery. Like you can rub the clay
                    all over me.
          
                               CARL
                    OK.
          
          Carl goes to grab some clay.

                    I was kidding. Not as sexy as it
                    seems. It gets in like everywhere.
                        (awkward beat)
                    What should we do to celebrate?
          
                              CARL
                    Have dinner?
          
                              RENEE
                    How about Korean? Oh, no, you
                    probably already had some today.
          
                              CARL
                        (NERVOUSLY)
                    No, we just had American food,
                    American fare.
          
                              RENEE
                    You've just been so busy -- it'd be
                    fun to have a night just the two of
                    us. I wish we could just go to the
                    airport and hop on the first flight
                    outta here.
          
          Carl's eyes light up.
          
                               CARL
                    Yes.

                        (with an English accent)
                    I think we're going to London.

                              CARL
                    My Singaporean accent.     Pretty
                    good, right?
          
          They get to the front of the line.

                              RENEE
                    Maybe we shouldn't do this.

          Carl's walking towards security when he runs into TONY, the
          homosexual guy he hooked up with. Tony's handing out his
          books.

                    Do you want to change your life
                    through Mahayana Buddhism?
          
          Carl takes one of the books.
          
                                 TONY (cont'd)
                    Carl?
          
          Carl realizes who he is. Suddenly they are in the middle of

                    Yeah, well, I've been busy too.
          
          Renee comes up and grabs Carl's arm.

                       probably get going.

          INT. PLANE
          
          Renee and Carl have the aisle and window on the plane.   A
          YOUNG WOMAN comes up to Carl.
          
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                       Hi, there. Would you mind
                       switching places with me? I want
                       to be across the aisle from my mom.
          
          Her MOM is indeed across from Carl.
          
                                 RENEE
                       We're actually flying together.
          
                                 YOUNG WOMAN
                       It would really mean a great deal.
                       She's very scared of flying.
          
                                 CARL
                       Where's your seat?
          
          The YOUNG WOMAN points at her seat. It's a couple rows up in
          the middle. Her middle seat's BOOKENDED by a MOM with a
          SCREAMING BABY and an ENORMOUS MAN.
          
                                 CARL (cont'd)
                       This is an aisle. That's a middle.
          
          Renee looks at Carl like, why won't you just refuse?
          
                                                                    104.

          Carl between the crying baby and the ENORMOUS MAN. Renee
          turns and waves to him from a couple rows up. Carl puts on a
          saccharin smile and waves back.

                    So, now that we're here, what
                    should we do?
          
                              CARL
                    Well, clearly we should go there.
          
          Carl points to an advertisement for a telephone museum:

                              CARL
                    I had no idea that the earliest
                    switchboard operator headsets
                    weighed ten and a half pounds.
                    That is fascinating.
          
                                 RENEE
                    It is?

                    Not at all.

          EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Carl and Renee RIDE A TRACTOR.   Renee's taking photos as they
          BUMP OVER THE FIELD.
          
                              CARL
                    THIS IS AWESOME!
          
                              TRACTOR DRIVER
                    WANT ME TO OPEN THIS SUCKER UP?
          
                              CARL/RENEE
                    YES!
          
          The driver TURNS UP THE SPEED.   They're suddenly going crazy
          fast.

          Carl takes the wheel. The tractor IMMEDIATELY GETS AWAY FROM
          HIM. They SWERVE STRAIGHT and CRASH THROUGH THE WALL OF AN
          OLD BARN. The DRIVER kills the engine. Renee, Carl and the
          Driver catch their breath.

                    I'm sorry about the barn.

                       I mean, I know we haven't really
                       been seeing each other for that
                       long, but I don't know...
          
                                 CARL
                       Yes.
          
                                 RENEE
                       Yes?
          
                                 CARL
                       Definitely.
          
                                 RENEE
                       I think I'm falling, you know...
                       Are you... ?
          
                                 CARL
                       Yes.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                 RENEE
                       Before our flight, what do you say
                       we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks?
          
                                                                    107.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    I'm definitely falling for you.
          
          
          INT. LINCOLN AIRPORT
          
          Carl's sitting in the lounge at the Lincoln Airport.    An OLD
          WOMAN comes up to him.
          
                              OLD WOMAN
                    Excuse me. Would you mind bringing
                    this to my son?
          
          The Old Woman hands Carl an UNMARKED, SHADY-LOOKING PACKAGE.
          
                              CARL
                    Like you want me to bring it with
                    me? On the plane?
          
                              OLD WOMAN
                    Fedex is so expensive and this
                    needs to get to him today.
          
                              CARL
                        (very nervous)
                    Yeah. Sure. I'd be happy to.
          
                              OLD WOMAN
                    He's a tall, blond fellow named
                    Sheldon Winkleton. He'll be
                    holding a sign in the terminal with
                    his name on it. You are a dear.
          
          The Old Woman shuffles off.    Carl looks at the box.   Renee
          returns.
          
                              RENEE
                    I got US Weekly, Star and, for a
                    little culture, the National
                    Enquirer.
          
                              CARL
                    National Enquirer?
          
                              RENEE
                    They have movie reviews.    What's in
                    the package?
          
                              CARL
                    Just a gift for some buddies back
                    home.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          
          
          
          INT. AIRPORT - SECURITY
          
          Carl walks through security. He puts the package on the
          conveyor belt. They don't notice anything odd.
          
          
          INT. PLANE
          
          Carl and Renee sit next to each other on the plane.
          
                                 RENEE
                       I'm sorry, I have to go to the
                       bathroom.
          
          Renee heads to the bathroom. Carl takes the package out from
          under the seat in front of him. He starts to breathe really
          hard. He very gingerly opens the package. He pulls back the
          packing peanuts revealing... a box of homemade chocolates.
          Carl breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
          
          
          INT. AIRPORT
          
          Carl and Renee walk off the plane, Carl carrying the package
          under his arm. Carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign
          that says "SHELDON WINKLETON." He heads towards the guy but
          before he can several DEA AGENTS with ADORABLE, DRUG SNIFFING
          DOGS surround Carl. The dogs start BARKING LIKE MAD.
          
                                 DEA AGENT
                       Put the package down!    Put it down!
          
          Carl looks up to see "Sheldon" WALKING SWIFTLY OUT THE
          SLIDING DOORS of the airport.
          
                                 DEA AGENT (cont'd)
                       Get on the ground! Both of you!
          
          The DEA AGENTS KICK the box open. Chocolates spill out over
          the ground. They crack open the chocolates to reveal TINY
          BAGGIES OF COCAINE.
          
                                 RENEE
                       What the hell is that?
          
                                 CARL
                       I don't know!
          
          As Carl is dragged out by the cops, he passes Tony, standing
          near the exit, shaking his head.
          
                                                                 109.
          
          
          
          
          INT. JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          Carl's sitting across from two DEA Agents, Good Cop Bob and
          Bad Cop Bob.
          
                                 GOOD COP BOB
                    I'm Bob.
          
                              BAD COP BOB
                    And I'm Bob.
          
          Carl can't help but laugh.
          
                              BAD COP BOB (cont'd)
                    Do you find that funny?
          
          Carl sees his hand with "Yes" on it.
          
                             CARL
                    Yes. I'm sorry. Just let the girl
                    go. She doesn't know anything.
          
                              BAD COP BOB
                    We'll see about that, Carl.
          
                              CARL
                    Some old lady gave me a package in
                    the Lincoln airport to deliver to
                    her son, Sheldon Winkleton. That
                    was really stupid of me and I
                    realize that now. I don't know
                    anything about anything.
          
                              GOOD COP BOB
                    Just answer a few questions and I'm
                    sure we'll get this all sorted out.
                    Have you ever used illegal drugs?
          
          Carl stares at them.    He should probably lie...
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
          
                                 GOOD COP BOB
                    Pot?
          
                               CARL
                    Yes.   But that's all.
          
                              BAD COP BOB
                    How about shrooms?
          
                                                                   110.
          
          
          
          Carl nods.
          
                                 CARL
                       But that's the only bad shit I've
                       done. I swear.
          
                                 BAD COP BOB
                       Never cheated on a girlfriend?
          
                                 CARL
                           (WEEPING)
                       Yes, I have. But I was in high
                       school. I was a mess. She had
                       cheated on me --
          
          The Bad Cop SLAMS his fist down on the table.
          
                                 BAD COP BOB
                       You disgust me.
          
          The Good Cop restrains the Bad Cop.
          
          
          INT. JAIL - OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM
          
          The two cops DISCUSS Carl. We see Carl freaking out through
          the one-way mirror behind them as they talk.
          
                                 GOOD COP BOB
                       He's a moron. But I think he's
                       telling the truth.
          
                                 BAD COP BOB
                       I agree. No one ever admits to the
                       cheating question.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION
          
          Carl's sitting on the steps.    Renee comes out of the station.
          
                                 RENEE
                       What the hell happened?
          
                                 CARL
                       I can explain.
          
                                 RENEE
                       So explain. Are you a drug
                       smuggler?
          
                                                          111.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    Look, when the nice lady asked me
                    to take them on the plane, I
                    thought they were chocolates.
          
                              RENEE
                    You expect me to believe a nice
                    lady asked you to bring chocolates
                    on a plane?
          
                              CARL
                    I know how it sounds.
          
                              RENEE
                    I don't think you do.
          
          Carl just looks at her.
          
                              RENEE (cont'd)
                    If you can't be honest with me,
                    then you and the nice lady can have
                    a fun life in Candyland.
          
          Renee starts off.
          
                                 CARL
                    Wait!     I'll explain better.
          
          She turns back around.
          
          
          INT. COFFEE SHOP
          
          Carl sits across from Renee.
          
                              RENEE
                    So you've just been saying yes to
                    everything.
          
                                 CARL
                    Yes.
                        (THEN)
                    Pardon the pun.
          
                                 RENEE
                    Oh.
          
                              CARL
                    See? Do you get it now? It's
                    nothing, just a glitch really.
          
                                                                  112.
          
          
          
                              RENEE
                    I thought we had so much in common
                    but if you just yes to everything I
                    don't know that we do. How do I
                    know if you even like Korean food?
          
          Beat.
          
                                CARL
                    I don't.
          
                              RENEE
                    Do you even want to travel around
                    the world at all or do you want to
                    work at that bank and buy a lot of
                    Prada suits?
          
                              CARL
                        (CONFUSED)
                    Yes. And yes.
          
          Something registers in Renee.
          
                              RENEE
                    When I asked if you were falling
                    for me all you said was yes.
          
          She rises, shaking her head, and heads for the door.
          
                              CARL
                    It wasn't a lie.
          
                                RENEE
                    Yes.    It was.
          
          
          INT. BLOOD BANK
          
          Carl's strapped to a giant plasma donation machine. It's
          horrifying. As he donates plasma, he could not look more
          depressed.

                              CARL
                    I don't care. Just take it all.

          Carl stumbles into the lounge outside Chris's office.
          
                                                                 113.

                    Chris will be with you in a moment.

          INT. CHRIS PARKER'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Carl walks into Chris's office carrying a cup of coffee a
          Diet Coke, and a bottle of water.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    So I got a call from the police
                    department.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm not a drug dealer --
          
          Chris closes the door to his office.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I spent a couple years in prison
                    myself. So I backdated some stock
                    options. Excuse me for trying to
                    help our bottom line, right?
          
                              CARL
                    You got to do what you got to do to
                    help Mr. And Mrs. Shareholder.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    We are their slaves.
          
                                 CARL
                    Totally.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Honestly, I prefer for all my top
                    guys to have been in the Big House.
                    We've all eaten the slop. There's
                    a trust there you can't break.
          
          Chris holds out his hand.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
                    So, what do you say to being a VP
                    and expanding your microloan
                    program bankwide?
          
                                 CARL
                           (SURPRISED)
                    Yes.
          
          Carl shakes Chris's hand.
          
                                                                   114.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE
          
          Carl's office has VIEWS of other corporate parks. Despite
          the fancy digs, Carl's depressed. Chris pokes his head in.
          Carl's on the phone.
          
                              CARL
                        (on the phone)
                    That's right, we're dropping the
                    minimum loan to one dollar, bank-
                    wide.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Could you look through these
                    numbers and let me know which of
                    our five branches have been lagging
                    behind in profit?
          
          Chris dumps a folder on Carl's desk.
          
                              CARL
                    I thought I was just implementing
                    the microloan program.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    You're a VP, buddy. You do it all
                    now.
          
          
          INT. POTTERY STUDIO
          
          Carl's taking a pottery lesson. He is sadly going through
          the motions of making a pot. He checks his watch and
          departs, leaving the unfinished pot spinning on the pottery
          wheel.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK CORPORATE OFFICES
          
          The VPs are sitting around the board room.    Carl comes in,
          late, still covered in clay.
          
                              CARL
                    Sorry about that.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Carl, I'm glad you could join us.
                    So, to keep you all updated, we
                    should be merging with Korean Bank
                    International within the year.
          
          Everyone claps.
          
                                                                    115.
          
          
          
                              CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
                    As per our argument with KBI, we'll
                    be shoring up our bottom line.
                    Carl Kendall's done us the honor of
                    drawing up a preliminary list of
                    the branches that are on the
                    chopping block. Nice work, Carl.
          
          Carl looks horrified.
          
          
          INT. CHRIS PARKER'S OFFICE
          
          Carl's in the middle of a heated discussion with Chris.
          
                              CARL
                    You can't close the Maple Branch!
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I know that Maple's where you got
                    your start, but if I don't lay
                    those people off then I get laid
                    off. It's a vicious cycle.
          
                              CARL
                    You don't have to if you don't want
                    to.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                        (deadly serious)
                    If we don't close these branches
                    than KBI will buy our competitor
                    instead of us and put us all out of
                    business. If you want to be an
                    executive and get to do fun stuff
                    like your microloan project, then
                    you also have to be the bad guy who
                    lays people off. That's why we get
                    paid the big bucks. To make the
                    hard decisions.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Norman's crying.   Rooney's getting worked up.
          
                              NORMAN
                    The bank's all I've got. Every
                    morning I restock the hard candy,
                    polish the safe, write today's
                    interest rates on the board.
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    There are other banks.
          
                              ROONEY
                    We have to protest the merger.   Get
                    some grassroots action going.
                    Grass looks weak, but it grows
                    everywhere.
          
                              CARL
                    You don't even work at the bank.
          
                              NORMAN
                    You should protest with us!
          
                              ROONEY
                    Yeah! Protest with your employees!
                    It will only make you more popular!
          
          
          EXT. SOUTHWEST BANK CORPORATE OFFICES
          
          Southwest Bank employees and Carl stand in a picket line
          outside the corporate offices.
          
                              EMPLOYEES
                    Hell no! We won't go!    Hell no!
                    We won't go!
          
          Chris gets out of his car and heads to the office. Carl
          hides his face from Chris so that Chris won't recognize him.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Throw a rock at him.
          
                              NORMAN
                    Yeah, throw a rock!
          
          Carl grabs a rock and VERY DELICATELY LOBS IT in Chris's
          direction. He then TAKES OFF RUNNING in the opposite
          direction. He then CIRCLES AROUND and runs into the back
          entrance of the bank.
          
          
          INT. SOUTHWEST BANK CORPORATE OFFICES
          
          We FOLLOW Carl as he runs up the service entrance to the
          corporate offices.

          Carl then RUNS into his office and sits down at the desk.
          He's covered in sweat and is breathing heavily. Chris pokes
          his head in.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    Some asshole protestor threw a rock
                    at my head.
          
                              CARL
                    Those dicks.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    I wish using hoses wasn't such bad
                    PR.
          
          Chris leaves his office.

                              CARL
                    I think I made a mistake letting
                    Renee go like that. What if I'm
                    supposed to go on that trip?
          
                              PETER
                    You own an apartment because of
                    that job. People don't generally
                    leave good jobs.
          
                              CARL
                    But the bank doesn't feel right...
          
          Peter's phone rings.   Peter picks it up.
          
                              PETER
                    Hey, honey. I think we should go
                    with the tulips. I know roses are
                    more romantic, but they're also
                    much more clichéd. Babe, can you
                    wait a second?
                        (covering the phone)
                    I'm going to be on for a while.
                    Ask your guru. He's the one who
                    sent you on this retarded quest in

                    Of course! Would you like to
                    purchase my new book, "The Power of

                              CARL
                    Actually, I had a question for
                    you...
          
                              SANJI
                    Well, this line is for book

          Sanji's eating by himself.    Carl comes up to him.
          
                              CARL
                    I'm sorry to bother you again --
          
                              SANJI
                    Can't you see that I'm eating?
          
                              CARL
                    I have a really important question.
                    I have to choose between traveling
                    around the world with a girl I'm
                    really into or choosing a job that
                    will make me pretty well off. I
                    don't know which yes to take.
          
                              SANJI
                    How well off?
          
                              CARL
                    I don't know why that's important.
          
                              SANJI
                    I should know all the data.

                    A lot, OK?
          
                                                                   119.

                    seminar    in Aspen. It's only ten
                    grand a    week and it will open your
                    mind up    --
          
                              CARL
                    I don't want to go to a seminar. I
                    just need help with this question.

                    For you, eight grand a week. I
                    have helped celebrities like Cher
                    and Jack Welch. You will love it --

                        (REALIZING)
                    You're a total con artist.
          
                              SANJI
                    I am not a con artist. Have I not
                    set you on the life path you
                    desire?
          
                              CARL
                        (PANICKING)
                    I've put my life into the hands of
                    a con artist! And because of you I
                    have this retarded yes branded on
                    my hand for life!
                        (yelling to the
                         RESTAURANT)
                    This man is a con artist! Don't
                    listen to this man! He is a con
                    artist!
          
          Carl runs out of the restaurant.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl returns home.    Rooney's on the couch, wearing a headset
          playing Xbox Live.
          
                              ROONEY
                        (into the headset)
                    You are dead, AnalDestroyer832!
          
          Carl PULLS the xBox cord out of the law.
          
                                 CARL
                    Out!
          
                                                                120.
          
          
          
                               ROONEY
                    What?   Why?
          
                              CARL
                    You've slept on my couch for four
                    weeks. You're a grown man. Now
                    sack up and get the hell out of
                    here.
          
                              ROONEY
                    Will you let me stay here please?
          
                              CARL
                    Are you deaf?
          
                              ROONEY
                    You have to say yes if I ask you.
          
                                CARL
                    You knew?
          
                               ROONEY
                    I may not seem like I get it, but I
                    get everything. Lucy and Kath?
                    Made out one time in the bathroom
                    at Rudy's.
          
                              CARL
                    Get the hell out of here.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM
          
          Carl's in front of his computer. There are a bunch of emails
          selling Viagra. He angrily deletes them all. He gets a
          letter from the King of Nigeria.
          
                              NIGERIAN KING (V.O.)
                    Dear Carl, It is vitally important
                    you send me your bank account
                    information. The government will
                    be closing in on my account in the
                    very near future. Your good
                    friend, Omar, Former King of
                    Nigeria.
          
          Carl starts typing fast. As Carl writes the following email,
          we cuts of him THROWING AWAY THE BOXES OF STUFF HE BOUGHT
          OVER THE INTERNET and GIVING AWAY THE SIX KITTENS HE GOT TO
          THE ASPCA.
          
                                                                   121.
          
          
          
                              CARL (V.O.)
                    Omar, Let's cut the crap. You are
                    not a king. You're probably just a
                    teenage con artist jerking off
                    somewhere in Russia. Write me
                    again and I will find you and beat
                    your stupid lying face in. Dick.
                    Sincerely, Carl Kendall.
          
          Carl angrily flips off his computer.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          CLOSE ON THE ALARM.   His alarm goes off.   Carl HITS IT off.
          It's now DAYTIME.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Carl gets dressed. He puts on his suit and tie. His
          apartment is noticeably nicer than the last time we saw it.
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Carl drives down the street in a FANCY CAR. He PULLS INTO
          DUNKIN DONUTS. He gets out of the car and passes a guy
          handing out fliers.
          
                              FLIER GUY

                                CARL
                    No.
          
          Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.
          
          
          INT. DUNKIN DONUTS
          
          The Dunkin Donuts Cashier hands Carl his coffee.
          
                              DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER
                    Would you like an --
          
                                CARL
                    No.
          
          Carl hands the Cashier the money.
          
                                                                    122.
          
          
          
          
          INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE
          
          Carl sits in his office.   Lucy walks in.
          
                              CARL
                    Hey, Luce. What're you doing all
                    the way over here?
          
                              LUCY
                    It's been hard to reach you.
          
                              CARL
                    I've been a little swamped.
          
                              LUCY
                    Everything OK?
          
                               CARL
                    Yeah.   Things are great.
          
                              LUCY
                    I was wondering when you want to
                    meet with the florist.
          
                              CARL
                    Sorry, but I'm too busy these days.
                    Don't have time to help with the
                    party anymore. Good luck.
          
                              LUCY
                    You're just stopping, just like
                    that?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm not the one marrying you.
                    Maybe you should ask him for some
                    help.
          
                              LUCY
                    He is helping. Here I was thinking
                    we were actual friends.
          
          Lucy leaves, upset.   Carl doesn't move.

                    Nice.   Anyone else? Carl?
          
                              CARL
                    Have you guys thought that
                    teenagers don't have the financial
                    knowhow to use a credit card?
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    That's why they're such a ripe
                    market. Any ideas on how to pick
                    that low hanging fruit?

                         MACHINE)
                    Hey, Carl. Peter here. Long time
                    no see. Sorry to hear you won't be
                    planning our engagement party.
                    Although I guess that makes you
                    less gay than I thought you were.
                    We'll be watching the game at
                    Rudy's tonight, if you're
                    interested.
          
          Carl DELETES the message. He FLIPS ON Survivor and starts to
          absentmindedly sort through his mail. He throws away
          junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye.
          He reads the postcard.
          
                              JASON (V.O.)
                    Dear Carl. I know this is kind of
                    random, but I thought I should
                    write you. We met at that party at
                    Norman's apartment. I was the INS
                    guy who hated his life and hated
                    you. I just wanted to tell you
                    that I took your advice. I quit my
                    job and have founded a home in
                    Botswana for elderly orangutans.
                    I've never been happier. You told
                    me to say "yes" and it has turned
                    out to be incredible. Thank you.
                    Yours truly, Jason Newmark
          
          Carl TURNS OVER the post card.   On the cover of the card is a
          picture an orangutan.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S APARTMENT
          
          Carl's alarm goes off. He opens his eyes. He's PROPPED the
          post card up next to his alarm clock. The orangutan seems to
          be staring into his soul.
          
          
          INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE
          
          Carl's writing a list of names. The post card lies on the
          desk nearby. His secretary pops her head in.

                              CARL
                    It's an elderly orangutan actually.
                        (handing her the list)
                    Could you please call everyone on
                    this list and tell them to show up
                    at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening
                    at 9PM?

                    Will do.
          
          Carl starts to head out and then turns around.
          
                               CARL
                    I just want to say, it was really
                    great having you as my first
                    secretary.

                    You're not firing me, are you?

                    I don't think I'm going to be
                    working here much longer.

          Carl walks into the crowded room.   Korean executives and
          Southwest Bank executives mingle.   Carl heads towards Chris.
          
                              CARL
                    I need to talk to you.
          
                              CHRIS PARKER
                    And I need to talk to you. You
                    mind doing a little ceremonial
                    translating?
          
                              CARL
                    I don't know if I'm good enough at

                    believes in you.
          
          SEUNG sees Carl and bows to him. Carl bows back. The Pretty
          Korean Banker sees Carl and coquettishly waves to him.
          Chris TAPS the microphone. The crowd sits down.

                    We have a traitor in our midst.
                    This man just called me a son of a
                    dog and informed me that my hand is
                    covered in fecal matter. He is
                    clearly trying to sabotage the
                    merger.
          
                              CARL
                    You speak English?
          
                              SEUNG KIM
                    You think an international bank
                    financier wouldn't speak fluent
                    English? For whom do you work,
                    traitor? Shanghai Bank?
                    Chinatrust?

                    For myself.
          
                              SEUNG KIM
                    Fine. Keep it secret.
                    Unfortunately, I cannot approve a
                    merger with a company so
                    incompetent as to have a business
                    saboteur this high up. Good day.
          
          Seung Kim walks out, followed by all his employees.   Before
          Chris can say anything...

                    What do you want?
          
                              CARL
                    I'm here to see Omar.   The former
                    King of Nigeria.
          
          OMAR, THE FORMER KING OF NIGERIA, a large, boisterous man,
          comes up from behind the guard.
          
                              OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
                    Is that Carl Kendall?
          
                              CARL
                    Omar! It's wonderful to meet you
                    in person
          
          Carl and Omar hug.
          
                              OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
                    And this must be Renee? What a
                    delight!
          
          Omar bends on one knee and kisses Renee on the hand.
          
                              RENEE
                    Thank you, your majesty.
          
                              OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
                    Please, call me Omar.
          
                                                                   132.
          
          
          
                              CARL
                    I'm sorry for calling you a
                    masturbatory Russian teenager.
          
                              OMAR, FORMER KING OF NIGERIA
                    Water under the bridge. What do
                    you say to having a feast?
          
          Carl, Omar, Renee and the guard go into Omar's palace. The
          door CLOSES BEHIND THEM.
          
                                                             THE END

							2nd Final White revised
							February 2, 1998

	

	FADE IN ON:

	CYBERSPACE

	We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
	sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
	stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
	computer sun starts to rise.

	We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
	over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
	move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
	glorious reds and yellows.

	We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
	Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
 	turn onto a street in the West 80s.

	Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

	At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
	words:

	ADDING ART

	As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
	increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
	we are in real life.

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

	Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
	way to Riverside Drive Park.

	We go through the brownstone window into:

	INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

	KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
	fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
	bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
	inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
	children's classic.  Madeleine.

	As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
	the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
	the New York Times.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning.

				FRANK
			(as he reads)
		Listen to this -- the entire work force
		of the state of Virginia had to have
		solitaire removed from their computers --

	Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
	bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		-- because they hadn't done any work in
		six weeks.

	Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

				KATHLEEN
		Aren't you late?

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know what this is, you know what
		we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
		of Western civilization as we know it.

				KATHLEEN
		This is so sad.

	She tosses him his jacket.

				FRANK
			(points at her computer)
		You think that machine is your friend,
		but it's not.
			(checks his watch)
		I'm late.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
	with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
	typewriter with a cover on it.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		I'll see you tonight.

				FRANK
		Sushi.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		Great.  Bye.

	Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

	Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
	peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
	from sight.  She walks into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
	street and turns toward Broadway.

	He's gone.  Good.

	She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
	and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
	code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
	its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
	number and connects and we hear the machine:

				COMPUTER
		Welcome.

	And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
	hear:

				COMPUTER (cont'd)
		You've got mail.

	And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	We see a list of letters:

	Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
	can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
	Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

	Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
	all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

	Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

	And the letter comes up:
		   To: Shopgirl
		From: NY152
		   Re: Brinkley

	Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

				KATHLEEN
		Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
		of New York as much as I do --

	And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
	NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

				JOE (V.O.)
		-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
		and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
		to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
		and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
		team --
			(continued)

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
	is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
	Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
	charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
	some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

				JOE (cont'd)
		-- but he chose to stay with me so that
		he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
		a large green pillow the size of an inner
		tube.  Don't you love New York in the
		fall?  It makes me want to buy school
		supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
		newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
		name and address.  On the other hand,
		this not knowing has its charms.

				VOICE
		Darling --

				JOE
		Mmmmmhmmm --

	Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
	into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
	which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
	papers.

				PATRICIA
		I'm late.
			(indicating the newspaper)
		Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
		riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
		makes one less person I'm not speaking 
		to --
			(she drains a cup of espresso
			 as a second starts to come out
			 of the machine)
		Vince got a great review.  He'll be
		insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

				JOE
		Am I going?

				PATRICIA
		You promised.

				JOE
		Can't I just give them money?  That's the
		cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
		that.

	Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

			     JOE
		All right, I'll go.  You're late.

			     PATRICIA
		I know I know I know.

	She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

	Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
	close on the landing outside.

	IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

	As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
	on.

			     JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
		Welcome... You've got mail.

	And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I like to start my notes to you as if
		we're already in the middle of a
		conversation.  I pretend that we're 
		the oldest and dearest friends --
		as opposed to what we actually are,
		people who don't know each other's names
		and met in a Chat Room where we both
		claimed we'd never been before.

	INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

	As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
	elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
	morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
	continues:

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
		on my computer, I wait impatiently as it
		boots up.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

	As Joe comes out of his building.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I go on line, and my breath catches in my
		chest until I hear three little words:
		You've got mail.

	And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I hear nothing, not even a sound on the
		streets of New York, just the beat of my
		own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
	and starts downtown.

	Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
	her.

	As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
	West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
	taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
	dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
	trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
	unopened restaurants.

	Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
	newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

	Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
	the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
	Zabar's.

	Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
	the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
	her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
	the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	A building under construction, with plywood board covering
	the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
	entrance and enters.

	EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
	front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
	Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
	There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
	stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
	Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
	pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
	Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

				KATHLEEN
		Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
		Isn't it the most beautiful day?

	Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
	time.

				CHRISTINA
		I guess.  Yeah, sure.

	Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
	rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
	front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
	yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
	to the store.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you love New York in the fall?

	Christina looks at her puzzled.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
	"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
	around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
	with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
	some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
	of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
	playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
	with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
	Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
	Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
	On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

	Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
	suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
	Christina looks at her.

				CHRISTINA
		What's going on with you?

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		You're in love.

				KATHLEEN
		In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
		I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
		living with Frank.  Do you think you
		could get our Christmas mailers out this
		week?

				CHRISTINA
		By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
		Friday.  Now what's going on?
			(she looks at Kathleen)
		I'm just going to stand here till you tell
		me.

	A beat.

				KATHLEEN
		Is it infidelity if you're involved with
		someone on E-mail?

				CHRISTINA
		Have you had sex?

				KATHLEEN
		Of course not.  I don't even know him.

				CHRISTINA
		I mean cybersex.

				KATHLEEN
		No!

				CHRISTINA
		Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,
		they lose all respect for you.

				KATHLEEN
		It's not like that.  We just E-mail.
		It's really nothing, on top of which I'm
		definitely thinking of stopping because
		it's getting --

				CHRISTINA
		Out of hand?

				KATHLEEN
		Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's
		nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		Where did you meet him?

				KATHLEEN
		I can't even remember.
			(off Christina's look)
		The day I turned thirty I wandered into
		the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
		and he was there, and we started 
		chatting.

				CHRISTINA
		About what?

				KATHLEEN
		Books.  Music.  How much we both love New
		York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
			(starts smiling)
		Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

				CHRISTINA
		Excuse me?

				KATHLEEN
		Forget it.  We don't talk about anything
		personal.  We made a rule about that.
		I don't know his name, what he does or
		exactly where he lives, so it will be
		really easy to stop seeing him, because
		I'm not.

				CHRISTINA
		God, he could be the next person to talk
		into the store.  He could be...
			(as George walks in)
		George.

	GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
	salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
	to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

				GEORGE
		Morning.

				CHRISTINA
		Are you On Line?

				GEORGE
		As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
		just another way to be rejected by a 
		woman.

	BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
	and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
	oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
	and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning, Birdie.

				BIRDIE
		What are you all talking about?

				CHRISTINA
		Cybersex.

				BIRDIE
		I tried to have cybersex once but I kept
		getting a busy signal.

				CHRISTINA
		I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
		really depressed about not having a date,
		so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
		line and I won't be lonely, but I 
		couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
		thousands of people who didn't have dates
		trying to get on.
			(MORE)
		You have to wonder which is harder,
		getting a date or getting On Line when
		you don't have a date.

				GEORGE
		Getting a date is harder.

	We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
	two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

				KATHLEEN
			(to the kids)
		Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

	We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
	the front door to:

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
	start to load her trash.

				KATHLEEN
		Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
		last week and I got a ticket.  And you're
		late today -- I could have gotten
		another.

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		We were here, there was no garbage.

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

				KATHLEEN
		Of course there was --

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		What do you think, I don't want to pick
		up garbage?  You think I go up and down
		the street picking up garbage, I'm not
		going to pick up yours?  What's the
		matter with you?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
	
				GARBAGEMAN #1
		You don't even bundle it right, you're
		supposed to bundle it and leave it near
		the curb, you leave it near the store
		and you use cheap garbage bags, they
		smear all over the place, and then I got
		to pick it up with my shovel --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
	the window as the harangue continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		And now you're busting my chops.  You're
		just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
	up a sale.

				KATHLEEN
		That guy went ballistic on me.

				CHRISTINA
		I hope you told him off.

				KATHLEEN
		Not exactly.

	Another customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY

	A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
	passes the building under construction.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

	WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
	process of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
	hanging everywhere.

				KEVIN
		The electrical contractor called.  His
		truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
		in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
		because the shipment of pine had beetles.
		And there's some question about whether
		we're installing the stairs in the right
		spot --

				JOE
		That sounds great.

				KEVIN
		Testing one two three four.

				JOE
		Is the electrician here?

				KEVIN
		I just told you -- he hit a deer.

				JOE
		I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
		streets, just the beat of my own heart.
		I think that's the way it goes.
		Something like that.

				KEVIN
			(beginning to glean something)
		Did you and Patricia get engaged?

				JOE
		Engaged?  Are you crazy?

				KEVIN
		I thought you liked Patricia --

				JOE
		I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
		Patricia makes coffee nervous.
			(suddenly all business)
		Are we still on schedule?

				KEVIN
		We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

				JOE
		I guess we should announce ourselves
		soon.  Tell people we're coming.

				KEVIN
		This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
		The minute they hear they'll be lining up
		--

				JOE
		-- to picket --

				KEVIN
		-- the big bad --

				JOE
		--chain store --

				KEVIN
		-- that destroys --

				JOE
		-- everything we hold dear.  But we'll
		seduce them with our square footage and
		our deep armchairs and our amazingly
		swift checkout lines and our discounts
		and our...

				JOE & KEVIN
			(the trump card)
		-- cappuccino.

				JOE
		They hate us in the beginning, but we 
		get them in the end.  Meanwhile we 
		should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, 
		a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of
		Western Civilization As We Know It.

	INT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his
	grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently
	redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

	On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

				JOE
		Kevin and I are both a little concerned
		about the neighborhood response --
			(suddenly notices the garish
			 couch)
		What is this fabric?  Does it have a
		name?

				NELSON
		Money.  Its name is money.

				JOE
		Gillian selected it.

				NELSON
		Of course.

				SCHUYLER
		Your father is getting married again.

				JOE
		Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

				NELSON
		Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

				JOE
		Love.

				NELSON
		Yes, that is one reason.

				SCHUYLER
		I think you're a damn fool.

				NELSON
		Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
		for him if his parents were married.

				SCHUYLER
		Annabel is eight and I'm not married to
		her mother.  I can't even remember her
		mother's name.
			(he laughs merrily)

				JOE
		I have a very sad announcement to make.
		City Books on 23rd Street is going under
		...

	Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

				NELSON
		Another independent bookstore bites the
		dust --

				SCHUYLER
		On to the next.

				JOE
		And I'm buying their entire stock --
		architecture, New York history -- for the
		new store.

				NELSON
		How much are your paying?

				JOE
		Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
		this exquisite mohair episode.
			(indicates the couch)
		We're also going to have a section on
		West Side Writers --

				SCHUYLER
		-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

				NELSON
		Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side
		liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
		hearts --

				JOE
		Readers.  They're called readers.

				NELSON
		Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them
		from jumping down your throat --

				SCHUYLER
		What's the competition?

				JOE
		One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
		Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
		The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
		forever.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store.

				JOE
		Who's that?

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
		might have had a date once.  Or maybe we
		just exchange letters.

				JOE
		You wrote her letters?

				SCHUYLER
		Mail.  It was called mail.

				NELSON
			(fondly nostalgic and kidding
			 it slightly)
		Stamps.  Envelopes.

				JOE
		Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
		of communication before I was born.

				NELSON
		Exactly.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
		She was too young for me, but she was...
		enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

				NELSON
		Too bad for her.

	As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
	upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		Welcome.  You've got mail.

				JOE (V.O.)
		My father is getting married again.  For
		five years he's been living with a woman
		who studied decorating at Caesar's
		Palace.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		You've got mail.

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

	Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through
	the subway car.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Once I read a story about a butterfly in
		the subway, and today I saw one. I
		couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd
		--
			(continued)

	The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and got off at 59th, where I assume it
		was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat
		that will turn out to be a mistake.  As
		almost all hats are.

	EXT. H & H BAGELS - NIGHT

	A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you know that every night a truck
		pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a
		ton of flour into the ground?  The air is
		absolutely amazing.

	As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the
	air.  It is amazing.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about
		100 times --

	INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

	As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand
	it.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and every time I read it I worry that
		Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to
		get together -- but the truth is whenever
		I think about my favorite book I always
		think about the books I read as a child --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-
		time favorite children's book.
			(continued)

	She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that
	won't stop making doughnuts.

				JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine in it that
		won't stop making doughnuts, they just
		keep coming down the chute just as
		regular as a clock can tick.

	EXT. KRISPY KREME STORE - DAY

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Have you been to Krispy Kreme?
			(continued)

	Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge
	doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as
	regular as a clock can tick.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine right in the
		window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an
		hour.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Joe leaves with his morning coffee.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NEW YORK - MORNING

	Joe goes to his painter at work: COMING SOON is as far as he's
	gotten.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	She enters Starbucks.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone
	ordering.

	We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall
	mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

	The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:
	COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

	Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't
	really pay attention to the sign painter.

	We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by
	a television news truck.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

	EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

	They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an
	apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars
	and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

	George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

				TV REPORTER
		The body of a woman was found this
		morning on the roof of a New York
		building...

	As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS
	with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
	who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

				TV REPORTER
		Here is a resident of the building.  Your
		name, please?

				GEORGE
		George Pappas.

				REPORTER
		Did you see or hear anything unusual last
		night?

				GEORGE
		No.  I didn't go out.

	At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH
	CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

				REPORTER
		The victim was red-haired, about thirty-
		five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you
		encounter anyone by that description
		in the building?  Sir?

	George hasn't heard a word.

				REPORTER
		Have there been any wild parties 
		lately?

	George doesn't answer.

				REPORTER
		Could it perhaps be one of your
		neighbors?

	George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he
	does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,
	ignored, finally turns away.

				REPORTER
			(to camera)
		As you can see, no one here knows
		anything.

	He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
	Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now
	says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.

	George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
	Christina is unpacking boxes.  Birdie is at the desk.  George
	looks at Christina meaningfully.

				CHRISTINA
			(totally mystified)
		What?

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre. I had one. I
		never believed in them, but I just had
		one.

				BIRDIE
		Is that the thing where you get cold
		suddenly, bang?

				CHRISTINA
		No, that's the coup de vieux.

				BIRDIE
		I had that.

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre is where you get
		love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

				BIRDIE
		I had that too.  Only I had it in
		Seville, where it was called ,el
		estruendo de amor.

				GEORGE
		I don't know her name, or anything about
		her.  I may never see her again.

				CHRISTINA
		And if you ever do meet her, you'll find
		out all the horrible details, and that
		will be that.  She'll turn out to have
		pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the
		walls.

				GEORGE
		I won't care.

	Kathleen sticks her head into the back.

				KATHLEEN
		Can someone help me out here?

				CHRISTINA
		George had a coup de foudre.

				GEORGE
		And Christina's making fun of me.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't let her.  I believe in this, I
		completely believe in this.  It happened
		to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

				CHRISTINA
		And she was wrong every time.

				KATHLEEN
		Yes!
			(beat)
		Who was she?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  She was standing outside
		my building with the police and the
		reporters.

				KATHLEEN
		What police and reporters?

				GEORGE
		Someone died.

				KATHLEEN
		Who?

				GEORGE
		I have no idea about that either.
		They found her on the roof.

				KATHLEEN
		A dead body.  That's so sad.  But
		you fell in love.  That's so great.

				GEORGE
		Oh.  One other thing.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just
	around the corner.  A Foxbooks Superstore."

	Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.

				CHRISTINA
		Quel nightmare.

				KATHLEEN
		It has nothing to do with us. It's
		big, impersonal, overstocked and 
		full of ignorant salespeople.

				GEORGE
		But they discount.

				KATHLEEN
		But they don't provide any service.  We
		do.

	George and Christina nod.

	INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME

	Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.

				KATHLEEN
		So really it's a good development.  You
		know how in the flower district, there
		are all these flower shops in a row so
		you can find whatever you want.  Well,
		this is going to be the book district.
		If you don't have it, we do.

				BIRDIE
		And vice versa.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is
	standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric
	typewriter.

				FRANK
		When you are finished with Foxbooks, the
		Shop Around the Corner is going to be
		responsible for reversing the entire
		course of the Industrial Revolution.

				KATHLEEN
		That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.
		That is so sweet.

				FRANK
		Hey --

	He holds his arms out.  They hug.

				KATHLEEN
		Although...

				FRANK
		What?

				KATHLEEN
			(over his shoulder, she notices
			 the typewriter, breaks from
			 the hug)
		What is that doing there?

				FRANK
		Listen to it.  Just listen--

	He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

				FRANK
		The Olympia Report deluxe Electric
		Report.  As in gunshot.

				KATHLEEN
		That sound is familiar.

				FRANK
		Now listen to this.

	He puts his ear to the typewriter.

	Kathleen listens too.

				KATHLEEN
		That whirring?

				FRANK
		The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
		piece of machinery so perfect --

				KATHLEEN
		I know where I've heard it before.  I
		know.

	She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
	It's the same machine exactly.

				FRANK
		I needed a backup.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you have another one at your
		apartment?

				FRANK
		I might, I might.  So what?

				KATHLEEN
		You're turning my apartment into a
		typewriter museum.

				FRANK
		I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.
		I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,
		what were you starting to say?

				KATHLEEN
		When?

				FRANK
		Before.

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I was just wondering about
		my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do
		exactly?  All I really do is run a 
		bookstore --

				FRANK
		All you really do is this incredibly
		noble thing --

	Kathleen nods.

				KATHLEEN
		But I don't know if I --

				FRANK
			(stopping her)
		Kathleen --

				KATHLEEN
		But I just --

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed.

	Kathleen looks puzzled.

	He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed waving in the 
		breeze standing strong and tall in 
		the corrupt sands of commerce.

	He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
	it to her.

				KATHLEEN
			(reading from it)
		I am a lone reed.
			(tries it on again)
		I am a lone reed.

	Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

	We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the
	next room.

	Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes
	over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

	A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,
	walk past with a tall woman.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

	She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
	Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
	illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
	marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then
	looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer
	keys.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead
		a small life.  Well, not small, but
		circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,
		do I do it because I like it, or because
		I haven't been brave?  So much of what I
		see reminds me of something I read in a
		book, when shouldn't it be the other way
		around?
			(continued)

	And hold on her as she thinks about this.

	In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

	Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure
	barely lit by her computer.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I don't really want an answer.  I just
		want to send this cosmic question out
		into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

	INT. DRIP - DAY

	Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches
	and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  Kathleen is
	standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.

				CHRISTINA
		I went to the Foxbooks Website and you
		can buy anything.  They ship it to you
		in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

				KATHLEEN
		My mother would never have wanted us to
		have a website.  "Every book you sell is
		a gift from your heart."  She always said
		that.

	As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a 
	stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

				CHRISTINA
		What if they put us out of business?

				KATHLEEN
		It's out of the question.  We're a
		fixture in the neighborhood.  We're
		practically a landmark.
			(indicating the binders)
		Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for
		Women -- what is this?

				CHRISTINA
		You fill out one of these forms and they
		file it in the book and if someone wants
		to meet you, they arrange it.

				KATHLEEN
		What a stupid way to meet someone.

				CHRISTINA
		Compared to the Internet?

				KATHLEEN
		My little thing on the Internet is just
		a lark.

				CHRISTINA
		So it's still going on?

				KATHLEEN
		And I do not plan to meet him.
			(indicating the book)
		Why do I get the feeling that you are in
		here somewhere?

	Christina flips the book open to her application.

				CHRISTINA
		I came in here one night and drank too
		much coffee and filled one out.
			(off Kathleen's look)
		Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

				KATHLEEN
		You are a runner.  Some day you will make
		eye contact with another runner and --

				CHRISTINA
		No one ever even looks at me.  They
		don't.  On top of which, who are they?
		They could like the symphony.  I could
		never fall in love with someone who 
		likes to go to the symphony --

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  What are you supposed to do
		there?

				CHRISTINA
		I don't know.

				KATHLEEN
		Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

				CHRISTINA
		I could never fall in love with anyone
		who smokes cigars either.

				KATHLEEN
		I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs
		like stumps.

				CHRISTINA
		Yeah.  I hate that too.

				KATHLEEN
		The worst, the worst -- I could never,
		under any circumstances, love anybody
		who had a sailboat.

				CHRISTINA
		Neither could I.

				KATHLEEN
		If I had to get up on Saturday morning
		knowing that I was about to go down to
		the pier and unravel all those ropes and
		put on all that sunblock --

				CHRISTINA
		All that talk about the wind.

				KATHLEEN
		And then you have to go out on the boat,
		and you sail and sail and sail until you
		are bored witless, and then, only then,
		do they say, let's turn around and you
		realize the trip is only half over, only
		it's not, because the wind has changed --

				CHRISTINA
		It hasn't changed.  It's died.

				KATHLEEN
		So then there's more talk about the wind.
		While you just float up and down trying
		not to get nauseous.  And when you
		finally get back, you have to clean up
		the boat.

				CHRISTINA
		Why don't people have boat maids?

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  There're all these people who
		wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
		doorknob in their house but put them on 
		a boat and they want to rub down 
		everything in sight.
		
	EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and
	whistling.

				ANNABEL
		Joe --

	Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his
	grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the
	dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old
	fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

				JOE
		Hello.
			(picks up Annabel)
		Annabel, how are you today?

				ANNABEL
		Great.

				JOE
			(picks up Matt)
		Hey, big guy --

				GILLIAN
		Don't I get a hello?

				JOE
		Hello, Gillian.

				GILLIAN
		Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked
		stepmother.

	Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

				JOE
		Who is this?

				GILLIAN
		Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case
		you couldn't handle the kids.

				ANNABEL
		Maureen's getting a divorce.

				JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				MAUREEN
		It's my own fault.  Never marry a man
		who lies.

				JOE
		That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

				ANNABEL
		She taught Matt to spell his name.

				MATT
		Fox. F-O-X.

				JOE
		Excellent, Matt.
			(to Maureen)
		Good work.  You can have the day off.
		I'll take over from here.
			(to Gillian)
		You must be late for something.
		Volunteer work at the Henry Street
		Settlement.  Packing bandages for
		Bosnian refugees.  A course in 
		Chinese literature at Columbia.

				GILLIAN
		I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

	EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

	There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage
	sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the
	makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.
	Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward
	Broadway.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy
	miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store
	and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,
	including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.
	Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads 
	from a Roald Dahl book.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER

	Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is 
	showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

				KATHLEEN
		This is her best friend Tacy, whose real
		name is Anastasia, and then in the next
		book Betsy and Tacy become friends with
		Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell
		you, is Thelma.

	In another section of the store:

	George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family
	Robinson from the glass case.

				GEORGE
		The illustrations are hand-tipped,
		which is why --

				JOE
		It costs so much.

				GEORGE
		It's why it's worth so much.

	Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole
	shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

				ANNABEL
		I want all of them.

				KATHLEEN
		That might be an awful lot for your dad
		to buy at one time.

				ANNABEL
		My dad gets me all the books I want.

				KATHLEEN
			(looking over at Joe)
		Well, that's very nice of him.

				ANNABEL
		That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

				KATHLEEN
		Oh, I don't really think that's your
		nephew --

	As Joe approaches.

				JOE
		It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't
		you, Aunt Annabel?

	Annabel nods solemnly.

				ANNABEL
		And Matt is --

				KATHLEEN
		Let me guess.
			(to Matt)
		Are you his uncle?

				MATT
		No.

				KATHLEEN
		His grandfather?

	Annabel and Matt start giggling.

				KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		His great-grandfather?

				MATT
			(shouting with glee)
		I'm his brother.

				JOE
		Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
		And Matt is my father's son.  We are an
		American family.

	He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

	Annabel suddenly sneezes.

	Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old
	fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to
	Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
	looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

				ANNABEL
		What is that?

				KATHLEEN
		A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not
		even know what handkerchiefs are?  A
		handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw
		away.  My mother embroidered it for me --
		you see?  My initials and a daisy, 
		because daisies are my favorite flower.

				ANNABEL
		Orchids are my favorite flower.

				KATHLEEN
			(to Joe)
		You know what else children don't know?
		They don't know what a telephone booth
		is?

	Joe is looking at Kathleen.

				JOE
		Who are you?

				KATHLEEN
		Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.
		Are you are?

				JOE
		Joe.  Just call me Joe.
			(quickly)
		We'll take these books.

	He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen
	has gotten for Annabel.

				KATHLEEN
		These are wonderful books.  As Annabel
		gets older the characters in the books do,
		too.
			(to Annabel)
		You can grow up with Betsy.

				GEORGE
		You're going to come back again, aren't
		you?

				JOE
		Of course.

				GEORGE
		This is why we're never going to go
		under.  Our customers are loyal.

				KATHLEEN
			(by way of explanation)
		They're opening a Foxbooks around the
		corner.

				ANNABEL
		Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

				JOE
			(gently putting his hand over
			 her mouth)
		-- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell
		anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be
		proud of --

				MATT
			(spelling)
		F-O-X.

				KATHLEEN
		That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can
		you spell dog?

				MATT
		F-O-X.

			     JOE
		Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
		Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
		Annabel, maybe you could read this to
		Matt while I wrap things up here.
			(moves them to a corner, to
			 them quickly)
		Sit down, read, and don't listen to
		anything I say.

	Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

			     JOE
		And the dinosaur book too.

			     KATHLEEN
		The world is not driven by discounts,
		believe me.  I've been in business
		forever.  I started helping my mother
		here after school when I was six years
		old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't
		that she was selling books, it was that
		she was helping people become whoever
		they were going to turn out to be.  When
		you read a book as a child it becomes
		part of your identity in a way that no
		other reading in your life does.
			(stops herself)
		I guess I've gotten carried away.

			     JOE
		You have, and you've made me feel...

	He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,
	behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
	unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

			     KATHLEEN
		She was.  How did you know that?

			     JOE
		Lucky guess.

			     KATHLEEN
		Anyway.  She left the store to me, and
		I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

			     JOE
		How old is your daughter now?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

	She smiles at Joe...

			     KATHLEEN
		So Foxbooks can...

			     KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER
		Go to hell.

			     KATHLEEN
			(handing him his books)
		Here you go.

			     JOE
		We ready?

	Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them
	each a lollipop.

			     ANNABEL
		Bye, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What
		about cat?  Can you spell cat?

			     MATT
		F-O-X.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.
	PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief
	of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
	at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales
	reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with
	pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		And now, the book you've all been waiting
		for, the book it's been my dreams to
		publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
		has written her memoirs --

	There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
	flashes on screen.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- and I'm happy to report it is just
		crammed with tragedy.
			(she laughs gaily)
		Just kidding, but seriously, it's all
		here: poverty, addiction, divorce,
		tracheotomies --

	We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
	family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
	series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- her third husband beat her up, hip
		replacement, and an amazing face lift
		where all the injected fat fell to her
		chin.

	Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
	Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
	I Just Forget to Dust?"

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		This book is fabulous.  And even if it
		weren't, it would sell like crazy,
		because Veronica is going to plug it to
		death on every talk show in America.
		This book...

	Patricia bursts into tears.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
		crying.  Veronica and I have so much in
		common -- well, not all the sad parts --
		but we were both famous by the time we
		were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
			(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
			 pulling herself together)
		Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
		especially thrilled to be publishing it.
		Veronica lives in my building and we met
		in the elevator.  By the time we had
		traveled from the eighth floor to the
		first, we had a deal.  First printing:
		one million copies.

	Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

	INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales
	reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.
	Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

			     SARAH
			(quickly)
		You have a dentist appointment in twenty 
		minutes.  So you should leave soon...

			     PATRICIA
		What's my car number?

			     SARAH
		Car?  You didn't say anything about a car
		--

			     PATRICIA
		Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.
		God!

	She walks toward the exit.

	EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She
	spots one across the street.

			     PATRICIA
		Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

	She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

	The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia
	it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who
	gets into it.

			     PATRICIA
		Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is
		my taxicab.
			(to the driver)
		Don't take him.  I am telling you right
		now, and I am memorizing your number,
		don't take him.
			(to the man)
		Who the fuck do you think you are?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you going uptown?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Get in.  I'll drop you.

	INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

	As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

	Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately
	ignoring the man who stole her cab.

			     PATRICIA
		Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have
		been there, it was unbelievable, we're
		going to sell truckloads of your book.
		Call me.

	She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
	as the cab moves on.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you an editor?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I am a rabbi.

			     PATRICIA
		Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm
		sorry.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I hope you don't mind my asking, but are
		you Jewish?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		You should come to our temple.

			     PATRICIA
		I'm not really religious.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very
		religious person.

			     PATRICIA
		You're kidding, right?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		We are at West End Avenue and 83rd
		Street.  Every Friday night, we have a
		joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
		singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you
		have heard of us, we are known as The
		Singles Temple.

	He smiles at her.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		It's a very good place to calm down.

	The cab stops.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice
		to meet you.
			(gives the cabbie money)
		Take this woman to her destination.

	He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

			     PATRICIA
		Goodbye.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Frank comes up the stoop.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kathleen is dressed up for a party.

	Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.

			     FRANK
		I saw him.  I actually saw him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		I can't believe it.  I saw William
		Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought he was in Mexico.

			     FRANK
		Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in
		New York.  The most brilliant and
		reclusive novelist in the history of the
		world is here, in this neighborhood.  He
		may be living on this very block.

			     KATHLEEN
		Where did you see him?

			     FRANK
		I was on the subway --

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and this musician got onto the train --

	Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.
	The door between the cars opens and a man playing the 
	clarinet enters the car.

	No one looks up except Frank.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and I suddenly saw him, sitting
		directly across from me doing the
		crossword puzzle.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		How'd you know it was him?

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He looked exactly the same as his high
		school yearbook picture, which happens to
		be the last photograph ever taken of him.

	Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece
	of paper.

	CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

	As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
	of William Spungeon at 17.

	Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
	across the way.  They don't look remotely alike except that
	the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
	wearing the same style glasses.

	The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.
	Frank follows.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.

			     FRANK
		So I followed him.

	Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th.  He follows.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS

	Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&H Bagels passing a
	HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He went into H&H and bought a bagel
		with everything.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER

	As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we
	now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.

	Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He dropped his crossword into the 
		garbage and I rescued it.

	Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.

	INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS

	Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		Then he went into a sporting good store
		and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

	We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of
	running pants.  Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of
	joggers.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		William Spungeon and tube socks.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

	Frank looks back at the counter.  Spungeon's gone.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		And then I lost him.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

	Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.

			     FRANK
		Do you know what this is worth?

	He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the
	puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.

	INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As the two of them eat dinner.

			     FRANK
		What I was thinking as I was trailing him
		was that eventually I would have the
		courage to say hello to him, you know,
		not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
		fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
		like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you
		ever thought about trading up in the sock
		area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my
		work -- and then we'd become friends, and
		eventually I'd introduce him to you --
		you know how much he loves children's
		books, there's a whole long section in
		Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz
		-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
		so he could help save the store.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you talking about?

			     FRANK
		From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got
		tough, he could help rally support --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's never going to get to that.  The
		store is fine.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	As they walk along after dinner.

			     FRANK
		I don't even know why you would say that?

			     KATHLEEN
		Neither do I.  It just flew out of my
		mouth.

			     FRANK
		There's enough business for us all.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	As they go up in an elevator.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, we're fine.

			     FRANK
		You're more than fine, you're absolutely
		fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're fine.

	The elevator opens onto:

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI.  A mix
	of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

			     FRANK
		Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know
		Kathleen Kelly.

			     VINCE
		How are you?

			     FRANK
		Guess who I saw today on the subway?
		William Spungeon.

			     VINCE
		I thought he was in Mexico.

	They start chatting.

	Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two
	other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
	Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks
	stricken.

	Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but
	sneaks a look.

			     PATRICIA
		Would you get me another drink, sweetie?
		I'm all out.
			(continues chattering)
		So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good
		place to calm down."  Isn't that
		hysterical?

	They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

			     JOE
		Absolut on the rocks.

	As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

			     KATHLEEN
		A white wine, please.
			(very friendly)
		Oh, hello.

			     JOE
		Hi.

			     KATHLEEN
		Remember me, from the bookstore?

			     JOE
		Of course I remember you.

			     KATHLEEN
		How's your aunt?

			     JOE
		Good.  She's good.
			(gets his drink)
		I have to deliver this.  I have a very
		thirsty date.  She's part camel.

	Kathleen laughs.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

			     JOE
		And you're Kathleen.

	Joe vanishes into the party.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER

			     VINCE
		I can't believe you were talking to Joe
		Fox.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe Fox?  As in --

	She can't even finish the sentence.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

	Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

	Joe spins around, looks at her.

			     JOE
		F-O-X.

			     KATHLEEN
		God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who
		you --
			(she trails off)

			     JOE
		-- were with.
			(quoting)
		"I didn't know who you were with."

			     KATHLEEN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		It's from the Godfather.  When the movie
		producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the
		emissary of Vito Corleone --
			(continued)

	Kathleen is staring at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		-- just before the horse's head ends up
		in his bed never mind --

			     KATHLEEN
		You were spying on me, weren't you?  You
		probably rented those children.

			     JOE
		Why would I spy on you?

			     KATHLEEN
		I am your competition.  Which you know
		perfectly well or you would not have put
		up that sign saying "Just around the
		Corner."

			     JOE
		The entrance to our store is around the
		corner.  There is no other way to say it.
		It's not the name of our store, it's
		where it is.  You don't own "around the
		corner."

			     KATHLEEN
		Next thing you'll be using twinkle
		lights.

			     JOE
		Twinkle lights?

			     KATHLEEN
		Little white Christmas lights that
		twinkle.  I use them in my window and on
		all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

			     JOE
		Look, the reason I came into your store
		is that I was spending the day with
		Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a
		present when I see them because I'm one
		of those guys who likes to buy his way
		into the hearts of children who are his
		relatives.  There was only one place to
		buy children's books in the neighborhood
		-- although that will not always be the
		case, and it was yours, and it is a
		charming little bookstore.  You probably
		sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

			     KATHLEEN
		How do you know that?

			     JOE
		I'm in the book business.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm in the book business --

			     JOE
		Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.
		Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
		oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
		your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
		books.  Me a spy.
			(beat)
		Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands
		on a secret printout of the sales figures
		of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
		full of its own virtue that I was instantly
		compelled to rush over and check it out
		for fear it would drive me out of business 
		--

	Kathleen stares at him.  She's speechless.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		What?
			(off her look)
		What?

	Kathleen shakes her head.

	Frank turns up.

			     FRANK
		Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

			     JOE
		-- Joe Fox.

			     FRANK
		Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,
		enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
		City Books -- tell me something:
		How do you sleep at night?

	Patricia joins them.

			     PATRICIA
		I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
		Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,
		just half, and you will wake up without
		even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank
		Navasky, aren't you?

			     FRANK
		Yes.

			     PATRICIA
		Your last piece in the Independent, the
		one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.
		I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this
		man is the greatest living expert on
		Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

			     JOE
		And this is Kathleen Kelly --

	Kathleen glares at him.

			     FRANK
		You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.
		You know you write these things and you
		think someone's going to mention them and
		then the whole week goes by and the phone
		doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm
		a fraud, a failure --

			     PATRICIA
		You know what's always fascinated me
		about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how
		old they looked when they were really
		just our age.

	Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
	Patricia, who smiles at them all.

			     PATRICIA
			(to Frank)
		I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We
		will talk.  Have you ever thought about
		doing a book?

			     FRANK
		Oh sure, it's passed through my head.
		Something really relevant for today like
		the Luddite movement in 19th century
		England.

	At the same time:

			     JOE
		Patricia --

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.

			     FRANK
		I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a
		very nice person.

	Kathleen doesn't respond.  Frank turns out the light.

			     FRANK
		She needs educating, that's all.

	A beat.

			     FRANK
		She's hopelessly driven by money and
		power, but there's a hope for anyone 
		who's that familiar with my work --

	On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,
	eyes open.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Joe and Patricia get into bed.  Brinkley is already on the
	bed.

			     PATRICIA
		I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so
		down-to-earth.

	Joe doesn't respond.  Patricia turns out the light.

			     PATRICIA
		You read his stuff, you think he's going
		to be so obscure and abstruse.

	A beat.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		He's always talking about Heidigger and
		Foucault and I have no idea what any of
		it's about, really.

	Joe gets up.  Brinkley follows.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		I'm not really tired.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe writes on his computer.  Brinkley on the floor next to him.

	And cut between Joe and his computer screen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Do you ever feel you become the worst
		version of yourself?  That a Pandora's
		Box of all the secret hateful parts --
		your arrogance, your spite, your
		condescension -- has sprung open.
		Someone provokes you, and instead of 
		just smiling and moving on, you zing 
		them.  Hello, it's Mr. Nasty.  I'm sure 
		you have no idea what I'm talking about.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	And cut between screen and

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.

	Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know what you mean and I'm completely
		jealous.  What happens to me when I'm
		provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My
		mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night
		tossing and turning trying to think of
		what I should have said.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	As he replies:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass
		all my zingers to you and then I would
		never behave badly and you could behave
		badly all the time and we'd both be
		happy?  On the other hand, I must warn
		you that when you finally have the
		pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
		say at the moment you mean to say it,
		remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think
		we should meet?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.

	She's frozen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Meet?  Omigod.

	She sits staring at the letter.  She has no idea what to do.

	EXT. 75TH STREET & COLUMBUS - DAY

	As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
	way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
	The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.
	The video store.

	And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks
	Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate
	on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost
	soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON
	ALL BEST-SELLERS.

	People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

	CAMERA follows him...

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,
	comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone
	decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the
	alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven
	cash registers with seven cashiers.  Of course, books, books,
	books, as far as the eye can see.

	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY

	The store is jam-packed.  Joe with his father Nelson, his
	grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.

			     JOE
		No pickets, no demonstrations.

			     KEVIN
		The neighborhood loves us.

			     NELSON
		They're wondering where we've been all
		these years.  They're wondering how they
		ever did without it.

			     SCHUYLER
		It's a hit.

	They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
	start up the staircase to the second floor.

			     NELSON
		How's the children's book department?

			     JOE
		It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And
		there's that children's bookstore nearby
		--

			     SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store --

			     JOE
		Her daughter's --

			     NELSON
		We'll crush it --

			     SCHUYLER
		She was enchanting.

	And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
	come up the stairs behind them.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the
	street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
	paper.  Joe is at the newsstand.  She turns and pretends to
	be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
	walks on.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think it's a good idea for us
		to meet...

	INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as
	Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I love our relationship.  There's a lot
		going on in the day-to-dayness of my life
		and there's something magical...

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting
	the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.
	Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving
	decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
	colonists like Myles Standish.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		... and thrilling about this island in
		cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE
		DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

			     BIRDIE
		About $1200 less than the same week last
		year.

			     KATHLEEN
		That could be a fluke, right?

	They look at each other.

			     BIRDIE
		Or not.

			     KATHLEEN
		Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But
		it will all shake out.  Do you think I
		should put up more twinkle lights?

			     BIRDIE
		That's a lovely idea.

			     CHRISTINA
		What if we have to fold?  I'll never find
		another part time job and I won't be able
		to pay the rent and I'll have to move to
		Brooklyn.

			     GEORGE
		The joy of rent control.  Six room for
		$450 a month.

			     CHRISTINA
		We know.  You've told us a million times.
		I can't believe you're bringing it up at
		a time like this.  It's like bragging
		because you're tall.  Birdie never brags
		about her rent and she pays even less
		than you.

			     BIRDIE
		Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one
		to the other.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

	The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had
	swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

	George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

			     MEREDITH
		George Pappas?

			     GEORGE
			(I have died and gone to
			 heaven)
		Yes.

			     MEREDITH
			(flashing her badge)
		Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd
		like to ask you a few questions.

	Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the
	store.  He's in a complete daze.

			     KATHLEEN
		George?  Where are you going?

	He goes out the door.

	LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters
	as George leaves.

			     LAURA
		Kathleen, are you surviving?

			     KATHLEEN
		Laura!  We're so excited about your new
		book.  When should we schedule your
		signing?

			     LAURA
		Oh, it's being published in January.
		Are you going to be in business in
		January?  I'm so worried.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're doing great, aren't we?

			     CHRISTINA
		Great.

			     BIRDIE
		No difference whatsoever.

			     LAURA
		Thank God.  Well, you know you can count
		on me.  For anything, support, rallies.
		Picket lines.  We can get the Times to
		write something.  Or that nut in the
		Independent --

			     KATHLEEN
		What nut in the Independent?

			     LAURA
		Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of
		thing that would outrage him.

	She smiles brightly.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

			     MEREDITH
		Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder
		of the woman found on the roof of your
		building.  Do you live alone there?

			     GEORGE
		Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live
		alone?

			     MEREDITH
		Yes.

	George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
	the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,
	caressing it...

	Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right
	back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each
	other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

		MEREDITH
			(overwhelmed)
		What are you doing?

			     GEORGE
		I don't know.  I have no idea.

			     MEREDITH
		You have to stop.

			     GEORGE
		I can't.

	She utters a little moan.

	INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his
	arms.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY

	As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact
	with men running in the opposite direction.  No one will look
	at her.

	INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

	The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
	Thanksgiving.

	Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
	through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches
	across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into
	the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
	She stands there frozen.  A beat...

	Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this
	way and that.  No Joe.

	INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all
	disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a
	beeline for it.

	At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and
	gets on the line she was heading for.

	Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with
	her back to him.

	INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

	The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands
	over her credit card.

			     CASHIER
		This is a Cash Only line.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     CASHIER
		Cash Only.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is
		that okay?

			     PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE
		Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

			     CASHIER
		There's a sign.

			     PERSON IN LINE
			(to the person behind her)
		She doesn't have cash.

	"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the
	line.

	Joe turns to see what's going on.

			     ANOTHER PERSON
		Get on another line, lady.

			     JOE
		Oh, hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hello.

			     JOE
		Do you need some money?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I don't need any money.  Thank you
		very much.

			     CASHIER
		Get on another line.

			     JOE
		Hi.
			(off her nametag, big smile)
		Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is
		Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit
		card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

	Rose just stares at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Now it's your turn to say happy
		Thanksgiving back.

			     ROSE
		Happy Thanksgiving back.

	Joe looks at her, winks.

			     JOE
		Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How
		do you spell it?  I-T.
			(big smile)
		Now take this credit card and put it
		through the machine, zip zip.

	The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit
	card.

	Kathleen is appalled.

	Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

			     JOE
		So you're fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fine.

			     JOE
		Happy Thanksgiving.

	As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly
	starts to put her groceries into a bag.

	INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

	An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish
	French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,
	and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.

			     ANNABEL
		The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
		bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
		sun --

	Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits
	down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.
	Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
	and can't see her without turning around.

	As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to
	Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees
	Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers
	her his seat.  She sits.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the
	leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's
	living room.

	Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new
	girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing
	around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas
	song, and everyone is singing.

	As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

	As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the
	window.

	Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the
	customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

	"Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author
	Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

	Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
	lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a
	tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

	Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
	carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.

	Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
	starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
	computer.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		This is such an odd Christmas.  I find
		myself missing my mother, who's been dead
		for ten years.  New York at Christmas is
		so loaded with all the things we used to
		do --

	INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY

	As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in
	the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- going to the Nutcracker --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - 1972 - DAY

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,
		where I was knocked into a 6-year-old
		maniac --

	A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.

			     YOUNG KATHLEEN
		Hey, watch out --

			     SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY
		Me watch out, why don't you watch out?
		I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You
		think I come here to skate with babies?

	Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My first experience as a speechless
		person.

	Her mother skates up and takes her hand.  The boy skates off.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I always miss my mother at Christmas, but
		somehow it's worse this year since I need
		some advice from her.

	And we hear the sound of another computer.

	INT. JOE'S DEN

	As he replies to Kathleen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		My mother took me ice skating too --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY

	We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's
	hand --

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		-- although my mother did not skate.  The
		nanny skated --

	And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly
	peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER
	absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.

	INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY

			     JOE (V.O.)
		And I was in the Nutcracker.

	We see the stage now.  There's Young Joe, among the children
	at the Christmas party.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		So was my nanny.

	As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Different nanny.  By the way, I'm
		surprised you aren't a writer.  Although
		you probably are a writer and don't
		know it.  Are you a writer and I don't 
		know it?

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT

	Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot
	of a big room with a huge table and servants.  Joe looks very
	small at the table as he eats his soup.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		My mother died when I was ten.  I was
		staying with my father, who is not famous
		for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
		the news of her death was to tell me she
		would not be coming to pick me up as
		usual.  It was a car accident, and I
		don't know where she was going or who she
		was with, and I assume what I owe her is
		my tendency to cover almost any emotion
		with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you
		want to know what you're feeling.  She
		was very beautiful.  People toss that
		word around a lot, but my mother was.

	The camera moves closer to the dining table.  We see that
	tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.
	A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved
	himself to tears.  Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
	Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Ancient history.  So what kind of advice
		do you need?  Can I help?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter.

	She starts to type a response.

	Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message
	flashes on screen.

	From NY 152

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - TOTAL SHOCK

	ON SCREEN AS WE SEE THE MESSAGE

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I had a gut feeling you would be on line
		now.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Joe is in bed with his laptop.  And cut back and forth
	between them and their computer screens as they type Instant
	Messages to one another.  Possible split screens.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		I can give you advice.  I'm great at
		advice.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think you can help.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Is it about love?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My business is in trouble.  My mother
		would have something wise to say.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what
		I do best.  What's your business?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		No specifics, remember?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Minus specifics, it's hard to help.
		Except to say, go to the mattresses.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		It's from The Godfather.  It means you
		have to go to war.

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		The Godfather?

	She starts to type.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What is it with men and The Godfather?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		The Godfather is the I Ching.  The
		Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The
		Godfather is the answer to any question.
		What should I pack for my summer
		vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the
		cannoli."  What day of the week is it?
		"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."
		And the answer to your question is "Go to
		the mattresses."
			(continued)

	CAMERA ON KATHLEEN - CONSIDERING WHAT HE SAYS

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's
		business.  It's not personal it's
		business."  Recite that to yourself every
		time you feel you're losing your nerve.
		I know you worry about being brave, this
		is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the
		death.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.

			     PATRICIA
		Look what I bought.

	Joe types "Ciao" and signs off.  Looks up to see Patricia
	showing him a Plexiglas menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I was just passing this store on Columbus
		Avenue and it caught my eye.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     PATRICIA
		A Menorah.
			     JOE
		It doesn't look like a Menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I know.  I don't know what came over me.
		I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank, I've decided to go to the
		mattresses.  Do you think it would be a
		gigantic conflict of interest if you
		wrote something about us?

	INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	It's January.  The store is more crowded than we've seen it.
	Frank is there with several copies of the Independent.  The
	phone is ringing off the hook.  Christina and George are
	fielding calls.  Birdie is reading Frank's article.

			     BIRDIE
			(reading)
		"Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia
		Kelly have raised your children.  If this
		precious resource is killed by the cold
		cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be
		the end of Western civilization as we
		know it, but the end of something even
		dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
		Save the Shop Around the Corner and you
		will save your own soul."  Frank, that's
		charming.

			     FRANK
		You think it's a little over the top?

			     BIRDIE
		Just say thank you.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     CHRISTINA
			(calling to Kathleen)
		Channel 2's outside.

	INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME

	Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror.  She takes a deep
	breath.

			     KATHLEEN
		In a second.

			     GEORGE
			(from the other room)
		The Village Voice is coming.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod.

	Frank sticks his head in.

			     FRANK
			(in shock)
		It's him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		God. It is God.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen comes out of the storage room.

	William Spungeon is standing there.

			     WILLIAM SPUNGEON
		I'm William Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm
		Kathleen Kelly.

	Frank is practically levitating.

			     SPUNGEON
		I knew your mother.  Although she knew me
		only as W.  That enormous bookstore is
		obscene.

			     FRANK
		I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture
		in my wallet.

	He pulls it out.  Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

			     KATHLEEN
		We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is
		doing a special.

			     SPUNGEON
		I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
		all right with you.  They've been trying
		to interview me for years.

			     FRANK
		The press?  I'm the press.

			     KATHLEEN
		You'd allow that?  For me?  For the
		store?  That's incredible.  Although you
		wouldn't have to be photographed.  I
		respect that.  If it's television, they
		could just put one of those blurry dots
		in front of your face.

			     SPUNGEON
		No television.

			     CHRISTINA
			(referring to the TV crew)
		They're waiting for you --

			     FRANK
		I know all your books.  Phaelox the
		gnome, the little man who comes from
		nowhere... and is going nowhere...
			(quoting)
		"Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."
		"Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

			     SPUNGEON
		Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in
		hives.
			(to Kathleen)
		Here's my phone number.

			     KATHLEEN
		I had no idea William Spugeon had a
		phone.

			     SPUNGEON
		Adios.

	He gives a little wave and leaves.

			     FRANK
		This is historic.
			(beat)
		Do you realize what I've done?  By
		writing that piece, do you realize?
		I've brought William Spungeon in from
		the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely
		amazing.

	At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.

			     TV REPORTER
		Kathleen Kelly?

	Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

			     KATHLEEN
		Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		We're here in front of the Shop Around
		the Corner, the famous West Side
		children's bookstore now on the verge of
		having to close its doors because the big
		bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few
		hundred feet away, wooing customers with
		its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

			     KATHLEEN
		They have to have discounts and lattes,
		because most of the people who work there
		have never read a book.

	And pull back now to reveal that we're in:

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and
	Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

			     JOE
		She's not as nice as she seems on
		television.

			     KEVIN
		You've met her?

			     JOE
		She's kind of a pill.

			     KEVIN
		She's probably not as attractive as she
		seems on television either.

			     JOE
		No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

			     KEVIN
		So you don't feel bad about basically
		destroying her livelihood not to mention
		her legacy not to mention her raison
		d'etre.

			     JOE
		It's not personal --

			     KEVIN
		It's business.

			     JOE
		Right.  Exactly.

	They look up at the television.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

	Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.

			     JOE
		I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell
		cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
		to this, because it's really bad --
		more people can buy books.

	The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

	On Joe and Kevin.

			     KEVIN
		That's what you said?

			     JOE
			(outraged)
		That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't
		believe those bastards -- I said we were
		great, I said people can come and sit and
		read for hours and no one bothers them, I
		said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed
		them the New York City section.  I said
		we were a goddamn piazza where people
		could mingle and mix and be.

			     KEVIN
		A piazza?

			     JOE
		I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just
		inevitable, isn't it?  People are going
		to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

			     KEVIN
		-- and you into Attila the Hun.

			     JOE
		Well it's not me personally, it's more
		like it's the company --

			     KATHLEEN
			(on the television)
		And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,
		who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him
		compared his store to a Price Club and the
		books in it to cans of olive oil.

	On Joe, reacting.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	A small rally is taking place, with picket signs.  Kathleen
	is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the
	Borough President.

			     KATHLEEN
		My mother used to say to me that every
		book you sell is a gift from the
		heart...

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY

	As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little
	makeshift picket signs and singing songs.  "One, two, three,
	four, we don't want this Superstore."

	Customers go right through the line and into the store.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
	although the store is full of customers anyway.  The Fox men
	-- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
	Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
	old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the
	front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from
	Hiding to Support Bookstore.

			     SCHUYLER
		Who is this Spungeon anyway?

			     JOE
		He's a writer.

			     NELSON
		Well, I've never heard of him.  And
		neither has anyone else in this place.

	INT. TV SET - NIGHT

	As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS
	talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		The New York Literary world was shocked
		this week when William Spungeon, the most
		famously reclusive author since J.D.
		Salinger, announced that he was coming
		out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
		small children's bookstore on the West
		Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this
		tonight is a man I happen to think of as
		one of this city's most underappreciated
		assets, Frank Navasky.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		This all happened because of you, didn't
		it --

			     FRANK
		Well, I knew William Spungeon loved
		children's books so I wrote a provocative
		column --

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		Your specialty.

	Frank laughs.  Sidney-Ann laughs.

			     FRANK
		And it kind of smoked him out.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she and Frank watch the television show.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Technologically speaking, the world's 
		out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole
		idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible
		for you to tape what's on television
		while you're out of the house.  But the
		whole point of being out of the house is
		so you can miss what's on television.
		Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get
		behind.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Well, we're on television... and you're
		good at it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Thank you.

	Another little moment between them.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Are you planning to collect radios?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Do you think I should?

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		The Shop Around the Corner is a true New
		York treasure.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Any time.  Are we done?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Not at all.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Because I just want to say that the only
		show I do watch is yours.

			     KATHLEEN
			(appalled)
		Omigod.

			     FRANK
		Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I
		admit, I slobbered all over her.

	The show continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up
	the week's receipts.

			     GEORGE
		And I can't decide whether to put
		sausages into the meat sauce or just
		chopped meat.  Last time I made it,
		Detective Carter and I never even sat
		down to dinner because --
			(he makes some sort of hand
			 gesture indicating that sex
			 prevented them from dining)
		and last night, I made margaritas in the
		blender, and I took the ice cube and --

			     BIRDIE
		Spare us.

	George goes out the door.

	Birdie looks at Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't tell me.  Not the slightest
		difference?

	Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		How could that be?  All this publicity
		and not one bit of difference?
		Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What
		would Mom have done?

			     BIRDIE
		Let's ask her.

	She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a
	picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the
	locket up to her face.

			     BIRDIE
		Cecilia, what should we do?

	Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Shhhh.
			(after a beat, shrugs)
		She has no idea, but she thinks the
		window display is lovely.  Good night
		dearie.

	Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
	door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

	It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the
	store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in
	her path out of the shadows.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you
		doing here.

			     SPUNGEON
		Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.
		Stalking.

	He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an
	umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

			     SPUNGEON (cont'd)
		You look very beautiful.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

	He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he
	blows on his hand.

			     SPUNGEON
		An eyelash.  It's gone.

	Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you writing another book?

			     SPUNGEON
		I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in
		approximately six more years.

			     KATHLEEN
		Should I discount?

			     SPUNGEON
		It's about a man on a quest for knowledge
		who meets a woman he cannot resist.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I discount I have to fire someone
		because I can't discount with this
		overhead but whom could I fire?  I
		couldn't fire anyone.

	Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She
	stops, frozen in place.

			     SPUNGEON
		You have your mother's hair.  Thick,
		wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

	He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing?  Let me go.

	He backs her into a wall.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop it.  Are you crazy?

	She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.

			     SPUNGEON
			(calling after her)
		If you change your mind, you can E-mail
		me.  Hermit@AOL.com.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	The mail form says "To:" and Kathleen types in "NY 152".

	The form says "Re:" and Kathleen types in:  "Advice"

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain is falling.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I need help.  Do you still want to meet
		me?

	EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain is falling.

	We hear the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		"Where?  When?"

	INT. NUT SHOP OF BROADWAY - DAY

	George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop.  Kathleen is
	buying more lollipops.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're meeting in a public place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't
		even go out to the street with him
		afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit
		there and wait for you.

			     GEORGE
		Did you tell Frank?

			     KATHLEEN
		There's nothing to tell.

			     CHRISTINA
		But did you tell him?

			     KATHLEEN
		He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of
		the Chicago Seven trial.

			     GEORGE
		And he's gone to a place where there are
		no phones.  Do you even know this guy's
		name?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     CHRISTINA
		And you're going to meet him in a bar?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the
		cheesecake.

			     GEORGE
		And he will wear a flower in his lapel,
		and you will be carrying a copy of Anna
		Karenina with a rose in it.

	No answer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Oh God, no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Not Anna Karenina.  Pride and Prejudice.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - NIGHT

	As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown.

			     KEVIN
		I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book
		with a flower in it.

	Joe doesn't say anything.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KEVIN
		Which Jane Austen is it?

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
		I know.  Look, I'll just stay ten
		minutes.  I'll say hello.  Drink a cup of
		coffee and split.  I'm outta here.

	He looks at Kevin.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Walk me there, okay?

	EXT. 83RD STREET - NIGHT

	As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on
	West 83rd Street.

			     JOE
		What if she has a really high, squeaky
		voice?  I hate that.  It reminds me of
		those mice in Cinderella.

			     KEVIN
		What mice in Cinderella?

			     JOE
		Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the
		other one.  Why am I compelled to meet
		her?  I'm just ruining a good thing.

			     KEVIN
		You're taking it to the next level.  I
		always do that.  I always take a
		relationship to the next level, and if it
		works okay I take it to the next level
		after that, until I can finally get to
		the level where it becomes absolutely
		necessary for me to leave.

			     JOE
		I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I
		already said that, didn't I.  Christ.
		I'm a total wreck.

	As they reach:

	EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Joe stops and looks at Kevin.

			     JOE
		Kevin, this woman is the most adorable
		creature I have ever come in contact
		with.  If she turns out to be even as
		good-looking as a mailbox, I will be
		crazy not to turn my life upside down
		and marry her.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
			(a total panic)
		You go look.

			     KEVIN
		Me?

			     JOE
		Just go to the window and check her out.

			     KEVIN
		You're pathetic.

	Kevin goes to the window and looks inside.

	EXT. CAFE LALO - NIGHT

	Joe and Kevin in front.

	Kevin looks in the window.

			     JOE
		See her?

			     KEVIN
		There's a beautiful, whoa, a very
		beautiful girl.

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     KEVIN
		But no book.  Let me see, let me see...
		Wait a minute.  There's a book with a
		flower, so it must be her.

			     JOE
		What does he look like?

			     KEVIN
		There's a waiter blocking, I can't see
		her face.  He's serving her a cup of tea
		and she's putting in three spoonfuls of
		sugar --

			     JOE
		Well, why shouldn't she?

			     KEVIN
		No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.
		Oh, he's moving.

			     JOE
		Can you see her?

			     KEVIN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		And? --

			     KEVIN
			(clearly frustrated)
		She's very pretty.

			     JOE
		She is.  I knew she would be.  She had
		to be.

			     KEVIN
		She looks... I would say she has a little
		of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly
		person.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

			     KEVIN
		Why not?  You said you thought she was
		attractive.

			     JOE
		So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

			     KEVIN
		Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,
		I can tell you right now you ain't gonna
		like this girl.

			     JOE
		Why not?

			     KEVIN
		Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

	Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.

			     JOE
		Oh, God.

	A long beat.

			     KEVIN
		What are you going to do?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KEVIN
		You're going to let her just wait there?

			     JOE
		Yes.  Yes I am.  That's exactly what I'm
		going to do.  Why not?

			     KEVIN
		But she wrote the letters.

			     JOE
		Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you
		tomorrow.

	He walks away, leaving Kevin.

	Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other
	direction.

	INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
	tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks
	her watch.

	A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
	to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the
	empty chair at Kathleen's table.

			     MAN
		Do you mind?

	Kathleen jumps up.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.
		Please.

	She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the
	group as they playfully fight over the menus.

	She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride
	and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

	A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
	him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

	As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
	onto the floor.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh!

	She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
	precious china.

	In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as
	she rearranges the book and the flower.

	He disappears from sight.

	A beat...

	He walks in the door.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a
		coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

	Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

	Kathleen grabs it back.

			     KATHLEEN
		Do you mind?

	She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

			     JOE
		I didn't know you were a Jane Austen
		fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet
		you read it every year.  I bet you just
		love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental
		heart beats wildly at the thought that he
		and whatever her name is are really,
		honestly and truly going to end up
		together.

			     KATHLEEN
		Would you please leave?

	Joe sits down.

			     KATHLEEN
		Please?

			     JOE
		I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
		Is he late?

			     KATHLEEN
		The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is
		Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the
		greatest, most complex characters ever
		written, not that you would know.

			     JOE
		As a matter of fact I've read it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well, good for you.

			     JOE
		I think you'd discover a lot of things if
		you really knew me.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I really knew you, I know what I would
		find -- instead of a brain, a cash
		register, instead of a heart, a bottom
		line.

	Kathleen is shocked at herself.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     KATHLEEN
		I just had a breakthrough, and I have to
		thank you for it.  For the first time in
		my life, when confronted with a horrible,
		insensitive person I actually knew what I
		wanted to say and I said it.

			     JOE
		I think you have a gift for it.  It was a
		splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


			     KATHLEEN
		Meanness?  Let me tell you --

			     JOE
		Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying
		you a compliment.

	He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why are you doing this?

	She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

			     JOE
		What have we have?  A red, no, crimson
		rose, tucked into the pages.  Something
		you read about in a book, no doubt.  One
		of those books with a lady in a nightgown
		on the cover about to throw herself off a
		cliff.

	She holds her hand out for it.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Give it to me.

	Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

			     JOE
		It's a joke to you, isn't it?
		Everything's a joke to you.

	She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Please leave.  I beg you.

	He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
	next table, with his back to her.

	The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it
	hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
	by a pleasant looking woman.

	For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
	wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her
	compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look
	behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He
	turns away suddenly.

	Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

			     JOE
		You know what the handkerchief reminds
		me of?  The first day I met you --

			     KATHLEEN
		The first day you lied to me --

			     JOE
		I didn't lie to you --

			     KATHLEEN
		You did too --

			     JOE
		I did not --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought all that Fox stuff was so
		charming.  F-O-X.

			     JOE
		I never lied about it --

			     KATHLEEN
		"Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were
		one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
		with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."
		"Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with
		them?  Don't they know you're supposed to
		have last names?  It's like they're a
		whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

	She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
	on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
	table.

			     JOE
		I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

			     KATHLEEN
		That's not what I meant --

			     JOE
		And when I said the thing about the Price
		Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
		what I meant either --

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I
		feel so sorry for you.

	The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
	in a boa comes in the door.

			     JOE
		I am going to take a wild guess that this
		isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.
		Not, I gather, the world's greatest
		living expert on Julius and Ethel
		Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
		Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will
		you start out sweet as sugar candy and
		then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
		from the blue, find that sharp little 
		tongue of yours?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I won't.  Because the man who's
		coming here tonight is completely unlike
		you.  The man who is coming here is kind
		and funny -- he has the most wonderful
		sense of humor --

			     JOE
		But he's not here.

			     KATHLEEN
		If he's not here, he has a reason,
		because there is not a cruel or careless
		bone in his body.  I can't expect you to
		know anything about a person like that.
		You've nothing but a suit.

	A beat.  Joe gets up.

			     JOE
		That is my cue.  Good night.

	Joe leaves.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT

	Kathleen comes down the street.  She drops the rose in the
	trash can.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

	Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her
	coat and goes immediately to the computer.  She clicks on
	American Online.  Waits impatiently to connect.  Looks with
	anticipation at the mail box.

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

	Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

	She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
	face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and
	tosses it over her shoulder.

	She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
	her shoes.

	Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches
	up to turn out the light.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.
	The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates
	the room.

	Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.

			     PATRICIA (O.C.)
		So I said to her, "If you think I will
		even talk to you about paying that kind
		of advance for an author whose last book
		is being used as trivets all over the
		world, you are completely crazy."

	On Joe's face, barely bearing.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	As Kevin and Joe walk through the store.

			     KEVIN
		But underneath that disagreeable exterior
		she could turn out to be --

			     JOE
		A real bitch.  Let's not talk about it.
		I'm going back to the office.  You must
		have work to do.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.  This place is humming like a
		top.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen comes around the corner.  Christina is waiting.

			     CHRISTINA
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He never came.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood you up?

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think something happened, something
		terrible and unexpected that made it
		impossible for him --

	George walks in.

			     GEORGE
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He wasn't able to make it.

			     GEORGE
		He stood you up.

			     KATHLEEN
		What could have happened?
			(continued)

	George looks suddenly stricken.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,
		took one look at me and left.

			     CHRISTINA
		Not possible.

			     KATHLEEN
		Maybe there was a subway accident.

			     CHRISTINA
		Absolutely.

			     KATHLEEN
		A train was trapped underground with him
		inside.

			     CHRISTINA
		And no phone.

	George continues to look stricken.  He's starting to shake
	his head.

			     KATHLEEN
		Or an automobile accident.  Those cab
		drivers are maniacs.

			     CHRISTINA
		They hit something and you slam right
		into that plastic partition.

			     KATHLEEN
		His elbows could be in splints -- so he
		can't really dial --

			     CHRISTINA
		Or he could be in the hospital in one of
		those semi-private room with like --
			     
			     CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN
			(together)
		-- no phone.

	They look at George.  Still shaking his head.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to George)
		What?

	George hands them a New York Post.  They look at the cover:
	COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you saying?

			     GEORGE
		It could be.

	Dead silence.

			     GEORGE (cont'd)
		He was arrested two blocks from the
		cheesecake place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Is there a picture?

	There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
	head.

	They all look at it.

			     CHRISTINA
		So that explains it.

			     GEORGE
		He was in jail.

			     CHRISTINA
		And there was a phone --

			     GEORGE
		-- but he got only one call and he had to
		use it to call his lawyer.

			     CHRISTINA
		You are so lucky.

			     GEORGE
		You could be dead.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you crazy?  This man couldn't
		possibly be the rooftop killer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Remember when you thought Frank might be
		the Unabomber?

			     KATHLEEN
		That was different.

			     CHRISTINA
		How long did you sit there all alone?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

			     CHRISTINA
		Joe Fox!

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't want to talk about it.
			(closes her eyes)
		Let's get to work.

	They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to
	do.

	A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		There must be something to do.  There's
		always something to do.

	They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully
	toward it.  It's only Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood her up.

	Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about you.  Last
		night I went to meet you and you weren't
		there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so
		foolish.
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we
	hear a voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		And as I waited, someone else showed up,
		a man who has made my professional life a
		misery, and an amazing thing happened --
		I was able, for the first time in my
		life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say
		it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt
		terrible.  Just as you said I would.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

	The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And
		even though I can hardly believe what I
		said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm
		just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
		it did?  No matter what he's done to me,
		there's no excuse for my behavior.
		Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so
		wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a
		good reason for not being there last
		night, but if you don't, and if we never
		really connect again, I just want to tell
		you how much it has meant to me to know
		you were there.

	Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.
	Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

			     COMPUTER
		Goodbye.

	Joe stands and leaves the room.

	The computer sits there.

	Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator 
	door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes
	the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he
	comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts
	for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.
	He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

	Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I am in Vancouver.

	He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.
	He starts typing again:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I was stuck in a meeting, which I
		couldn't get out of it, and there was
		no phone.

	He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

	Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't
	get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he
	starts typing.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		The electricity went out in the building
		and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
		the telephone system blew too.

	He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Amazingly enough.

	He sits looking at it.

	Then he deletes the whole thing.

	Sits looking at the blank screen.

			     JOE
		Fuck you.

	He clicks the Yes box.

	Then he starts to type again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Dear friend: I cannot tell you what
		happened to me last night, but I beg you
		from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
		for not being there.

	He deletes "for not being there."

	Then types again, after "to forgive me".

			     JOE (V.O.)
		-- for what happened.  I feel terrible
		that you found yourself in a situation
		that caused you additional pain.  But I'm
		absolutely sure that whatever you said
		last night was provoked, even deserved.
		And everyone says things they regret when
		they're worried or stressed.  You were
		expecting to see someone you trusted and
		met the enemy instead.  The fault is
		mine.
			(continued)

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Someday I'll explain everything.
		Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

			     CHRISTINA
		Did he say anything about meeting again?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll
		just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.
		Patrick Campbell and write letters our
		whole lives --

	They go into an apartment building.

	INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A large rent-controlled West Side apartment.  Birdie is 
	pouring tea.  There's a plate of cookies.

	Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young
	woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.

			     CHRISTINA
		Where was this taken, Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Seville.

			     KATHLEEN
		When you had the thunderbolt?

			     BIRDIE
		Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

			     KATHLEEN
		Close.  We're going to close.

			     CHRISTINA
		Close.

			     KATHLEEN
		Although it feels like such a failure.
		It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels
		like... Mom...

	She closes her eyes.

	Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her
	arms around her.  Hold on them.

			     BIRDIE
		Keeping the store open doesn't keep your
		mother alive, although sometimes I think
		we all think it does.

	Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the
		thunderbolt over?

	Birdie shakes her head.  She's not going to tell them.

			     CHRISTINA (cont'd)
		It's so romantic.

			     BIRDIE
		But it wasn't meant to be.

			     CHRISTINA
		Why not?

			     BIRDIE
		He ran Spain.

			     CHRISTINA
		Spain?

			     BIRDIE
		The country.  He ran it.  That was his
		job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT

	As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
	movie.

			     FRANK
		She fell in love with Generalissimo
		Franco?

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't say that.  We don't know that for
		sure.

			     FRANK
		Who else could it have been?  It was
		probably around 1960 --

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, it's not like he was something
		normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
		or something --

			     FRANK
		It happened in Spain.  People do really
		stupid things in foreign countries.

			     KATHLEEN
		Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,
		they go see Flamenco, they ride in
		gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
		guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but
		they don't fall in love with fascist
		dictators.

	They enters one of the theatres.

	INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

	As they find seats and sit down.  A trailer is playing.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie is a very kind person, she's
		practically my surrogate mother.

			     FRANK
		Well she's out of her mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		She is not.

			     FRANK
		I could never ever be with anyone who
		doesn't take politics as seriously as I
		do.

	The person in front of them turns around.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Do you mind?

			     FRANK
		A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet
		while a hot dog is singing?

	The two of them sit there.

			     KATHLEEN
		I have something to tell you.  I didn't
		vote.

			     FRANK
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		In the last mayoral election, when Rudy
		Giuliani was running against Ruth
		Messinger, I went to get a manicure and
		forgot to vote.

			     FRANK
		Since when do you get manicures?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I suppose you could never be with a
		woman who gets manicures.

			     FRANK
		Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Shhhhhh.

			     KATHLEEN
		You forgive me.

	Hold on them a beat.

	Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT

	Kathleen on the down escalator.  Frank scrambling to catch up
	with her.

			     FRANK
		What's going on?

	Kathleen's upset.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		Hey.  What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As they walk uptown.

			     FRANK
		Look, this has been a big week, you're
		closing the store --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not that, Frank, really it's not.
		It's just... Frank...

			     FRANK
		I know, that was terrible of me.

			     KATHLEEN
		What was?

			     FRANK
		To jump all over you when I'm the one
		who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know
		how to say this --

			     KATHLEEN
		What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-
	in extension of a restaurant.

	INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.

			     FRANK
		You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		So are you.

			     FRANK
		And I'm honored that you want to be with
		me because you would never be with anyone
		who wasn't truly worthy --

			     KATHLEEN
		I feel exactly the same way about you.

			     FRANK
		Oh, God, don't say that, please, that
		just makes it worse.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?
			(he shakes his head)
		You don't love me?

	Frank shakes his head no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Me either.

			     FRANK
		You don't love me?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     FRANK
		But we're so right for each other.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		That woman on television, right?
		Sidney-Ann.

	Frank nods.

			     FRANK
		I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think she's a Republican.

			     FRANK
		I can't help myself.

	Kathleen pats him.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		What about you?  Is there someone else?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.
		Somewhere --
			(she throws up her hands)
		In cyberspace.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's
	building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All
	Stock 40% off."

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY

	The store is crowded.  People are buying stacks of books.
	We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a
	customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's
	finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George
	saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though
	it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
	the last place on the earth.

	There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

	Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
	her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the
	sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My store is closing this week.
		I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?
		Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

	As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		This is a tragedy.
			(yelling across the shop to her
			 husband)
		Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the
		Swan.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		-- and in a week, it will be something
		really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I
		am being amazingly brave --

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		What are you going to do with yourself?

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I'm going to take some
		time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm
		almost looking forward to it --

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna
		throw up.

			     SECOND SHOPPER
		I came here every Saturday when I was a
		little girl.  I remember when your mother
		gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it
		with a box of Kleenex," that's what she
		told me.

			     THIRD SHOPPER
		She's looking down on you right now.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm sure she is.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I have promised myself I'm not going
		to cry.

	A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books
	up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
	counter.

			     FOURTH SHOPPER
		We should bomb Foxbooks.

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not their fault.  The truth is, the
		world is just... different.

	She starts ringing up the sale.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen walks home.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,
		someone, some foolish person will
		probably think it's a tribute to this
		city, the way it keeps changing on you,
		the way you can never count on it, or
		something.  I know, because that's the
		sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the
		truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if
		part of me has died,  and my mother has
		died all over again, and no one can ever
		make it right.

	She stops in front of the window, watching the customers
	lined up to buy books.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen enters and looks around.

	She goes up the stairs.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT

	As Kathleen walks into it.

	It's huge, of course.  With its reading area, and stage, and
	room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
	books and so many customers.

	Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
	wilted.

	KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.

	And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance.  She doesn't
	see him.

	A woman browsing, stops a sales person.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Do you have the "Shoe" books?

			     SALESPERSON
		The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		I don't know.  My friend told me my
		daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, 
		so here I am.

			     KATHLEEN
		Noel Streatfeild.  Noel Streatfeild wrote
		Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and
		Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...
			(she starts crying as she tells
			 her)
		I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my
		favorite, although Ballet Shoes is
		completely wonderful.

			     SALESPERSON
		Streatfeild.  How do you spell that?

			     KATHLEEN
		S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Thank you.

	As she walks away.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		They know nothing, they know absolutely
		nothing.

	ON JOE

	as he watches her.  We hear the sound of the computer.

	She starts out of the store.  And hold on him.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN

	A screen which says Reply and which now reads "I'm sorry."

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

			     JOE
		Asshole.

	He backspaces, deleting.  Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.
		Truly I don't.  And anything I do say
		will sound trite.  I hope you feel
		better.

	He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.

	EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's
	building.

			     PATRICIA (V.O.)
		What I was thinking was she'd probably
		make a great children's book either.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Why would you think that?

	They get out of the cab.

			     PATRICIA
		She knows everything.  She has flawless
		taste.  She's famous for it.
		The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes
		it, it sells.  Period.

	INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.

			     JOE
		So you're going to offer her a job?

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?  What else has she got to do?

			     JOE
		Now that she's destitute --

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

			     JOE
		Well, I can't imagine her working for
		you.

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?

			     JOE
		She has a horrible personality, she's...
		nice to everyone all the time.  It's
		exhausting.  And her staff turnover is
		... non-existent.  They've been there
		forever.  Until... recently, when they
		all found out they were going to lose
		their jobs.

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

	The elevator door is closing.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Hold the elevator!

	They get in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

			     JOE
		Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

			     PATRICIA
		Last time, we rode in an elevator, we
		made the deal of the century.  What is
		going to happen this time?

			     CHARLIE
		Miss Grant's going to get me a part in
		one of her movies, that's what's going
		to happen.

			     VERONICA
		In your dream, Charlie.

			     PATRICIA
			(back to the conversation with
			 Joe)
		I love how you've totally forgotten you
		had any role in her current situation.
		It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone
		... Who?  Who does it remind me of?
			(thinks for a moment)
		Me!

	The elevator suddenly stops.

			     PATRICIA
		Shit.

			     VERONICA
		Shit.

			     JOE
		It is stuck?

			     CHARLIE
		Could be.

	He pushes the open button.  Nothing.  Turns the key, hits the
	open button, flicks the emergency switch.  The he starts
	hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

			     JOE
		Charlie, what are you doing?

			     CHARLIE
		Bang the door.

			     PATRICIA
		Really.

	Joe bangs the door.  Nothing.

			     CHARLIE
		I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
		basement.

			     VERONICA
		Can it do that?

			     JOE
		No.

	He picks up the phone.

			     JOE
		This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.
		We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There
		are four of us --

			     PATRICIA
			(grabs the phone)
		-- and if you don't get your ass up here
		in two shakes and get us out --

	He hangs up.

			     JOE
			(to Veronica)
		Are you all right?

			     VERONICA
		It's hot.

	Joe hands her his handkerchief.

			     CHARLIE
		Everyone should jump in the air.

			     PATRICIA
		What?

			     CHARLIE
		We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one
		is here and it opens.

	Everyone stares at each other.

			     JOE
		One -- two -- three --

	They all jump into the air.

	They all land.

	Nothing happens.

	INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

	Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her
	nails.

	We hear the fire department banging outside...

			     VERONICA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to
		start speaking to my mother.  She slept
		with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's
		fault, I don't know, and then she sold
		the story to Inside Edition.
		That could have been Oscar's idea, too.
		Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder
		what she's doing right this minute.  I
		think of her... whenever I hear about a
		new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I
		just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

	She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

			     PATRICIA
		Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That
		would be so great for the book.

			     CHARLIE
			(trying to figure it out)
		If I ever get out of here...

			     PATRICIA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm having my
		eyes lasered.

			     CHARLIE
		I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I
		should marry her.  I don't know what's
		been stopping me.

	He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,
	shows it to Joe.

			     JOE
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

	He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her
	purse.

			     PATRICIA
		Where is my TicTacs?
			(looks at Joe)
		What?

	The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT

	Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat.  Joe
	is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.

	He boards his boat and goes below.  A light goes on.  We hear
	the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I came home tonight and got into the
		elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour
		later, I got out of the elevator and
		Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly
		everything had become clear.
			(continued)

	INT. BOAT - NIGHT

	A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where
	Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.

	Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		It's a long story.  Full of the personal
		details we avoid so carefully...

	Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow.  Brinkley
	jumps back onto the berth with Joe.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Kathleen is making tea.  She starts toward the bedroom.  We
	see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all
	of Frank's typewriters used to be.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I wonder whether change isn't a kind of
		infection.  You start with one thing --
		something you never ever thought would
		change and it does --
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		and the next thing you know even your bed
		is in a different place.

	Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has
	been rearranged.

	She gets into bed and turns on the television set.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	The bookshelves are empty.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		Six months ago, when you and I first met,
		I knew everything about myself -- what I
		would be doing for the rest of my life
		and even the person I would be doing it
		with.  Now I know nothing.

	On the door is a small sign.  "After 42 years, we are closing
	our doors.  We have loved being part of your lives."

	Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

	The little bell over the door jingles.

	Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
	it.

	Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

	Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
	for the last time.

	The grate starts to lower.

	Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks
	off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

	And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns
	into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

	And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
	screen.

		What about going to the Children's Zoo?

			     ANNABEL
		I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

			     JOE
		Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

			     ANNABEL
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     MATT
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     JOE
		Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

	INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY

	Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
	Japanese soup and noodles.

			     JOE
		I'll read you a story.

			     ANNABEL
		Where did she go?

			     JOE
		She had to close her store.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		She didn't have enough business.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Well.  Her store was very close to our
		store, and you know our store sells books
		at a slightly lower cost --

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more
		people can buy books.

			     ANNABEL
		Why couldn't she sell that way too?

			     JOE
		Because she's small and we're big.  How
		about we go get some candy?

			     ANNABEL
		So now she's gone and it's all your
		fault.

			     JOE
		It's business, Annabel.  It's not
		personal.  How about we go get so much
		candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
		for days?

			     MATT
		What's personal?

			     ANNABEL
		Personal means that she's gone forever,
		and now we'll never get another book from
		her as long as we ever live.

	She burst into tears.  Matt bursts into tears too.

			     JOE
		Remember the man who worked with her?

			     ANNABEL
			(a wail)
		No.

			     JOE
		Well I hired him.

			     ANNABEL
		You killed the Storybook Lady.

	Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

	Annabel sobs hysterically.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex.  She has a

	We hear the sound of computer keys clicking.

			      JOE (V.O.)
		Why haven't you written?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I'm lying in bed listening to Joni

		What are you doing here?

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - DUSK

	Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks.  Nelson
	lifts his glass in a toast.

			     NELSON
		To us.

			     JOE
		Father and son, together at last.  That
		happened with Gillian?

	Nelson ignores the question.

			     NELSON
		I've stayed here after, let's see, your
		mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --

			     JOE
		-- the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How
		ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

			     JOE
		-- also the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the
		astrologer.

			     JOE
		Whose moon turned out to be in somebody
		else's house, as I recall.

			     NELSON
		Just like Gillian.

			     JOE
		Gillian ran off with someone?

			     NELSON
		The nanny.

			     JOE
		Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with
		Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly
		ironic.

			     NELSON
		True true.

			     JOE
		There's no other word for it.

			     NELSON
		Who did you break up with?

			     JOE
		Patricia.  You met her.

			     NELSON
		Would I like her?
			(cracks himself up)
		Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have
		some peanuts.  Of course I have to live
		out of a suitcase for a least three
		weeks, and then there's the inevitable
		legal hassle, more of your inheritance
		down the drain.

			     JOE
		Don't worry about it.

			     NELSON
		I won't.  But then I get to meet someone
		new.  That's the easy part.

			     JOE
		Oh, right, a snap to find the one single
		person in the world who fills your heart
		with joy.

			     NELSON
		Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been
		with anyone who fits that description?
		Have you?

			     JOE
		On to the next.

			     NELSON
		Isn't it a beautiful night?

	Hold on Joe.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY

	Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a

		May I please come up?

			     KATHLEEN
		It's really not a good idea.

	Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.
	Joe follows.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

			     KATHLEEN
			(into the intercom)
		I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?
		I'm sniffling and not really awake --

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an
	empty stoop.

			     KATHLEEN'S VOICE
		and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four
		hours a day, and taking echinacea --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN
			(into intercom)
		-- and vitamin C, so I would really
		appreciate it if you would come some
		other time --

	There's a knock on the door right next to her.  Kathleen
	practically jumps out of her skin.  She looks through the
	peephole.  There he is.

			     JOE
		Kathleen?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just a second.

	She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
	scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door.  Joe is
	holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

			     JOE
		Hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I heard you were sick and I was worried
		and I wanted to --
			(he hears voices)
		Is someone here?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just the Home Shopping Network.

			     JOE
		Bought any porcelain dolls?

			     KATHLEEN
		I was thinking about it.
			(beat)
		You put me out of business --

			     JOE
		I know that --

			     KATHLEEN
		And now you turn up with flowers?  Did
		you come to gloat?

			     JOE
		No.

			     KATHLEEN
		To offer me a job --

			     JOE
		No, I wouldn't think of --

			     KATHLEEN
		Because I have plans, I have lots of
		offers.  I've been offered a job by --
		well, actually by --

			     JOE
		My former?

			     KATHLEEN
		Former?

			     JOE
		We broke up.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect
		for each other.
			(she claps her hand over her
			 mouth)
		I don't mean to say things like that.  No
		matter what you have done to me, there is
		no excuse for my saying anything like
		that.  But every time I see you --

			     JOE
		Things like that just seem to fly out of
		your mouth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.
			(sharply)
		Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.
			(she says it again, a little
			 more nicely)
		Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

	She starts to the door.

			     JOE
		I bought you flowers.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.
			(trying as hard as she can)
		Thank you.

	She takes them.

	He takes them back.

			     JOE
		Why don't I put them in water?

	He heads for the kitchen.  A beat, while she stares after him.
	Then follows.

	INT. KITCHEN - DAY

	When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle
	for water.  Turns on the stove.

			     JOE
		You're sick.  Sit down, please.

	He pulls out a kitchen chair.  Kathleen sits.  She's a little
	woozy.

			     JOE
		Vase?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper left.

	He gets out a vase.  Fills it with water.

			     JOE
		George says hello.  He told me you
		weren't feeling well.

			     KATHLEEN
		How is George?

			     JOE
		Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.
		No one is allowed to work in his
		department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in
		children's literature.

	He unwraps the paper around the flowers.  Daisies.  Puts them
	in a vase.

			     KATHLEEN
		I love daisies.

			     JOE
		You told me.

	He puts the vase on the kitchen table.  Kathleen plays with
	the petals.

			     KATHLEEN
		They're so friendly.  Don't you think
		they are the friendliest flower?

			     JOE
		I do.

			     KATHLEEN
		When did you break up?

			     JOE
		Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

			     KATHLEEN
		Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This
		other person I know broke up with someone
		in an elevator.  I think it was in an
		elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after
		it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly
		everything became clear.  When I saw you,
		at the coffee place, I was waiting for him
		and I was --

			     JOE
		-- charming.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was not charming.

			     JOE
		Well, you looked charming.

	The teakettle whistles.  Joe turns off the burner.

			     JOE
		Tea?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper right.

	He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was upset.  And I was horrible.

			     JOE
		Honey?

	Kathleen nods.  He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

			     JOE
		I was horrible.

			     KATHLEEN
		True.  But I have no excuse.

	She picks up the daisies and carries them into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Joe follows her.  They both sit.

			     JOE
		Whereas I am a horrible person and have
		no choice but to be horrible, is that
		what you're saying?

			     KATHLEEN
		No I am not saying that because I am done
		saying horrible things, even to you.

			     JOE
		You did it again.

	She claps her hand over her mouth.

			     JOE
		I put you out of business.  You're
		entitled to hate me.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't hate you --

			     JOE
		But you'll never forgive me.  Like
		Elizabeth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     JOE
		Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.
		She was too proud --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

			     JOE
		-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.
		Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.
			(beat)
		It wasn't personal --

			     KATHLEEN
		-- It was business.  What is that
		supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.
		All it means is it's not personal to you,
		but it's personal to me, it's personal to
		a lot of people.
			(she shrugs helplessly)
		What's wrong with personal anyway?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, whatever else anything is, it
		ought to begin by being personal.

	Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

			     KATHLEEN
		My head's starting to get funny.  I have
		to go back to bed.

	They walk to...

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
	She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
	herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why did you stop by?  I forget.

			     JOE
		I wanted to be your friend.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.

			     JOE
		I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I
		say?  Sometimes a person just wants the
		impossible.  Could I ask you something?

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		What happened with that guy at the cafe?

			     KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

			     JOE
		But you're crazy about him --

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I am.

			     JOE
		Then why don't you run off with him?
		What are you waiting for?

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't actually know him.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KATHLEEN
		We only know each other -- oh God, you're
		not going to believe this --

			     JOE
		Let me guess.  From the Internet.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		You've Got Mail.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Very powerful words.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

	Joe sits on the edge of the bed.

			     JOE
		I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I
		make a little suggestion?  I think you
		should meet him.  No.  I take it back.
		Why meet him?

			     KATHLEEN
			(starting to get sharp again)
		I hardly think I need advice from someone
		who --

	He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  And
	holds it there.  It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

			     JOE
		I concede I bring out the worst in you,
		but let me help you not to say something
		you'll just torture yourself about for
		years to come.

	She starts to smile and he removes his hand.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		I hope you're better soon.  It would be 
		a shame to miss New York in the spring.

	Joe stands.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you for the daisies.

	He starts for the door.

			     JOE
		Take care.

			     KATHLEEN
		I will.

			     JOE
		Goodbye.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye.

	We hear the door close.

	Hold on Kathleen.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Christina is running.  She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER
	coming toward her.  She has no hope that he will notice her,
	and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

			     MALE RUNNER
		Hi.

			     CHRISTINA
		Hi.

	He passes her.  Christina can't believe it.

	She does a little dance of joy.

	Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
	beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

	Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.

	INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING

	Patricia comes in.

	The place is packed.  There are hundreds of young Jewish New
	Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  The Rabbi
	is dancing among them.

	Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

	The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

			     RABBIT
		Shabbat shalom!

	He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
	whirling off together.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen at the computer, typing.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about this and
		I think we should meet.

	She clicks the send button and then exits from American On
	Line.

	On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
	several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.

	She clicks Word.

	She goes to File: New.

	There are several choices of format.

	She stares at the choices.  Then she clicks Book format.

	A blank page appears in the computer.

	She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little
	girl named..."

	She pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  She sees
	the flowers that Joe brought her.

	And then she types: "Daisy."

	As she goes on typing...

	INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT

	On Joe typing.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		We should meet.  And we will meet.  But
		I'm in the middle of a project that
		needs...
			(he pauses to think of the
			 right word)
		... tweaking.

	A look of calculation on his face.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of
	coffee.

	And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks.  He waves at her,
	pretending surprise at seeing her.  Has he been watching the
	store and waiting for her to come in?  We'll never know.

	INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.

			     JOE
		Tweaking?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's what he said.

			     JOE
		He's probably married.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not
		possible.

			     JOE
		Have you asked him if he's married?  Have
		you said, "Are you married?"

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

	Joe looks at her, shrugs.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she types:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know this is probably a little late to
		be asking, but are you married?

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	As he answers:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Am I married?  What kind of a question is
		that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't
		you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.
		Your friends are telling you the reason
		we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I
		right?

	INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY

	Kathleen and Joe having nachos.

			     JOE
		So he didn't exactly answer.

			     KATHLEEN
		He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew
		exactly what I was up to.  Which is just
		like him.

			     JOE
		But he didn't exactly answer, did he?
		Did he?

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		Maybe he's fat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't care about that.

			     JOE
		You don't care that he might be one of
		those guys who's so fat he has to be
		removed from his house with a crane?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's very unlikely.

			     JOE
		Why else do you think he's putting off
		meeting you?  Although... maybe that's
		not it.  Maybe...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		Never mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		What????

			     JOE
		He could be waiting til he's paroled.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you won't believe this, there was a
		moment when George thought he might be
		the rooftop killer, which was completely
		ridiculous --

	Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
	true.

			     JOE
		What's his handle?

	She shakes her head.

			     JOE
		Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is
		that what you think?

			     KATHLEEN
		NY 152.

			     JOE
		One five two.  One hundred fifty two.
		Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.
		He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
		He's had 152 moles removed and now he
		has 152 pockmarks.

	EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER

	As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.

			     JOE
		His combined college board scores.

			     KATHLEEN
		His IQ.

			     JOE
		The number of women he's slept with.

			     KATHLEEN
		The number of times he's seen The
		Godfather.

			     JOE
		That's the first good thing I've heard
		about him.

			     KATHLEEN
		His address.  No, no, no.  He would never
		do anything that prosaic.

	On Joe, looking a little wounded.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The only thing I really care about
		besides the married thing... and the
		jail thing... is the boat thing.

			     JOE
		The boat thing?

			     KATHLEEN
		I could never be with anyone who has
		a boat.

			     JOE
		Oh.

			     KATHLEEN
		So that clinches it.  We'll never be
		together.  I'll take care of these.

	He picks up a mango, squeezes it.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I could never be with anyone who likes
		Joni Mitchell.
			(singing, imitating Joni)
		"It's cloud's illusions I recall, I
		really don't know clouds at all."  
		What does that mean?

	Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.

	But Kathleen doesn't say anything.

	She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some
	she wants.

			     JOE
		How's your book coming?

	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

	As they walk away from the market, going uptown.

			     KATHLEEN
		There's a children's book editor I know,
		from the store, and she's excited to 
		read it.  When I finish it.  Who would 
		ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,
		if I didn't have all this free time, I
		would never have discovered --

	She stops, realizing what she's saying.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The truth is, he was the one who made me
		start thinking about writing --

			     JOE
		Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

			     KATHLEEN
		Mister 152... insights into my soul.

			     JOE
		Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope
		your mango's ripe.

			     JOE
		I think it is.  Want to bump into me
		Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

	EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	As Joe types.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		How about meeting Saturday?  The first
		day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place
		in Riverside Park at 88th Street where
		the path curves and when you come around
		the curve, you'll find me waiting.

	INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

	Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.

			     JOE
		Today?

			     KATHLEEN
		Today.

			     JOE
		Whoa.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.  In Riverside Park.

			     JOE
		Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,
		and I don't even know it.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
	papaya drinks.

			     JOE
		He could be the Zipper Man.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who's that?

			     JOE
		This guy on Amsterdam who repairs
		zippers.  You'll never have to buy new
		luggage.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop teasing.

			     JOE
		Timing is everything.  He waited until
		you were primed.  Until you knew there
		was no other man you could ever love.

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost believe it)
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Sometimes I wonder...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

	They stop walking, they look at each other.

			     JOE
		If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't
		been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd
		just met --

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't.

			     JOE
		I would have asked for your phone number
		and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24
		hours before calling and asking, "How
		about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
		for as long as we both shall live?"

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost a swoon)
		Joe...

			     JOE
		And then we would never have been at war.

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		The only fight we'd ever have is what
		video to rent on Saturday night.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who fights about that?

			     JOE
		Some people.  Not us.

			     KATHLEEN
		We would never.

	A long beat.

			     JOE
		If only...

			     KATHLEEN
		Please.  I have to go.

	She doesn't move.

			     JOE
		Let me ask you something?  How come
		you'll forgive him for standing you
		up and you won't forgive me for a 
		little tiny thing like putting you
		out of business?

	Kathleen looks at him.  Shakes her head.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		Oh how I wish you would.

	It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.

	It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		I really do have to go.

			     JOE
		You don't want to be late.

	She's in agony.

	He turns and walks away.

	After a moment, she does too.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her
	house.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her
	clothes.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON

	As she comes toward the entrance to the park.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.

	She comes to a stop.

	Looks around.

	A young woman in running clothes passes by.

	A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
	runners use to push babies in.

	Kathleen looks at her watch.

	Suddenly she hears a noise.  A dog barking.

	And Brinkley comes around the corner.

			     VOICE
		Brinkley!  Brinkley!

	And hold on Kathleen as she sees.

	JOE

	And she starts to cry.

	And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.

			     JOE
		Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

			     KATHLEEN
		I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to
		be you so badly.

	And as they kiss, we hold on them.

	And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
	park on a beautiful spring day.

	A dog is leaping around them.

	And as we get further and further away from them, the screen
	turns into

	CYBERSPACE

	And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

	And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

	and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
	clicking

					FADE OUT
You've Got Mail

			Based on:
				
			The Shop Around The corner

			by Nikolaus Laszlo



	
							2nd Final White revised
							February 2, 1998

	

	FADE IN ON:

	CYBERSPACE

	We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
	sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
	stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
	computer sun starts to rise.

	We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
	over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
	move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
	glorious reds and yellows.

	We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
	Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
 	turn onto a street in the West 80s.

	Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

	At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
	words:

	ADDING ART

	As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
	increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
	we are in real life.

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

	Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
	way to Riverside Drive Park.

	We go through the brownstone window into:

	INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

	KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
	fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
	bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
	inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
	children's classic.  Madeleine.

	As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
	the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
	the New York Times.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning.

				FRANK
			(as he reads)
		Listen to this -- the entire work force
		of the state of Virginia had to have
		solitaire removed from their computers --

	Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
	bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		-- because they hadn't done any work in
		six weeks.

	Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

				KATHLEEN
		Aren't you late?

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know what this is, you know what
		we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
		of Western civilization as we know it.

				KATHLEEN
		This is so sad.

	She tosses him his jacket.

				FRANK
			(points at her computer)
		You think that machine is your friend,
		but it's not.
			(checks his watch)
		I'm late.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
	with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
	typewriter with a cover on it.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		I'll see you tonight.

				FRANK
		Sushi.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		Great.  Bye.

	Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

	Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
	peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
	from sight.  She walks into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
	street and turns toward Broadway.

	He's gone.  Good.

	She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
	and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
	code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
	its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
	number and connects and we hear the machine:

				COMPUTER
		Welcome.

	And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
	hear:

				COMPUTER (cont'd)
		You've got mail.

	And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	We see a list of letters:

	Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
	can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
	Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

	Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
	all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

	Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

	And the letter comes up:
		   To: Shopgirl
		From: NY152
		   Re: Brinkley

	Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

				KATHLEEN
		Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
		of New York as much as I do --

	And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
	NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

				JOE (V.O.)
		-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
		and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
		to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
		and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
		team --
			(continued)

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
	is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
	Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
	charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
	some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

				JOE (cont'd)
		-- but he chose to stay with me so that
		he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
		a large green pillow the size of an inner
		tube.  Don't you love New York in the
		fall?  It makes me want to buy school
		supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
		newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
		name and address.  On the other hand,
		this not knowing has its charms.

				VOICE
		Darling --

				JOE
		Mmmmmhmmm --

	Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
	into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
	which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
	papers.

				PATRICIA
		I'm late.
			(indicating the newspaper)
		Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
		riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
		makes one less person I'm not speaking 
		to --
			(she drains a cup of espresso
			 as a second starts to come out
			 of the machine)
		Vince got a great review.  He'll be
		insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

				JOE
		Am I going?

				PATRICIA
		You promised.

				JOE
		Can't I just give them money?  That's the
		cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
		that.

	Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

			     JOE
		All right, I'll go.  You're late.

			     PATRICIA
		I know I know I know.

	She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

	Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
	close on the landing outside.

	IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

	As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
	on.

			     JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
		Welcome... You've got mail.

	And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I like to start my notes to you as if
		we're already in the middle of a
		conversation.  I pretend that we're 
		the oldest and dearest friends --
		as opposed to what we actually are,
		people who don't know each other's names
		and met in a Chat Room where we both
		claimed we'd never been before.

	INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

	As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
	elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
	morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
	continues:

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
		on my computer, I wait impatiently as it
		boots up.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

	As Joe comes out of his building.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I go on line, and my breath catches in my
		chest until I hear three little words:
		You've got mail.

	And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I hear nothing, not even a sound on the
		streets of New York, just the beat of my
		own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
	and starts downtown.

	Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
	her.

	As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
	West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
	taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
	dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
	trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
	unopened restaurants.

	Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
	newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

	Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
	the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
	Zabar's.

	Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
	the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
	her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
	the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	A building under construction, with plywood board covering
	the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
	entrance and enters.

	EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
	front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
	Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
	There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
	stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
	Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
	pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
	Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

				KATHLEEN
		Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
		Isn't it the most beautiful day?

	Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
	time.

				CHRISTINA
		I guess.  Yeah, sure.

	Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
	rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
	front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
	yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
	to the store.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you love New York in the fall?

	Christina looks at her puzzled.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
	"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
	around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
	with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
	some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
	of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
	playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
	with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
	Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
	Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
	On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

	Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
	suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
	Christina looks at her.

				CHRISTINA
		What's going on with you?

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		You're in love.

				KATHLEEN
		In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
		I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
		living with Frank.  Do you think you
		could get our Christmas mailers out this
		week?

				CHRISTINA
		By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
		Friday.  Now what's going on?
			(she looks at Kathleen)
		I'm just going to stand here till you tell
		me.

	A beat.

				KATHLEEN
		Is it infidelity if you're involved with
		someone on E-mail?

				CHRISTINA
		Have you had sex?

				KATHLEEN
		Of course not.  I don't even know him.

				CHRISTINA
		I mean cybersex.

				KATHLEEN
		No!

				CHRISTINA
		Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,
		they lose all respect for you.

				KATHLEEN
		It's not like that.  We just E-mail.
		It's really nothing, on top of which I'm
		definitely thinking of stopping because
		it's getting --

				CHRISTINA
		Out of hand?

				KATHLEEN
		Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's
		nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		Where did you meet him?

				KATHLEEN
		I can't even remember.
			(off Christina's look)
		The day I turned thirty I wandered into
		the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
		and he was there, and we started 
		chatting.

				CHRISTINA
		About what?

				KATHLEEN
		Books.  Music.  How much we both love New
		York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
			(starts smiling)
		Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

				CHRISTINA
		Excuse me?

				KATHLEEN
		Forget it.  We don't talk about anything
		personal.  We made a rule about that.
		I don't know his name, what he does or
		exactly where he lives, so it will be
		really easy to stop seeing him, because
		I'm not.

				CHRISTINA
		God, he could be the next person to talk
		into the store.  He could be...
			(as George walks in)
		George.

	GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
	salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
	to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

				GEORGE
		Morning.

				CHRISTINA
		Are you On Line?

				GEORGE
		As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
		just another way to be rejected by a 
		woman.

	BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
	and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
	oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
	and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning, Birdie.

				BIRDIE
		What are you all talking about?

				CHRISTINA
		Cybersex.

				BIRDIE
		I tried to have cybersex once but I kept
		getting a busy signal.

				CHRISTINA
		I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
		really depressed about not having a date,
		so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
		line and I won't be lonely, but I 
		couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
		thousands of people who didn't have dates
		trying to get on.
			(MORE)
		You have to wonder which is harder,
		getting a date or getting On Line when
		you don't have a date.

				GEORGE
		Getting a date is harder.

	We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
	two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

				KATHLEEN
			(to the kids)
		Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

	We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
	the front door to:

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
	start to load her trash.

				KATHLEEN
		Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
		last week and I got a ticket.  And you're
		late today -- I could have gotten
		another.

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		We were here, there was no garbage.

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

				KATHLEEN
		Of course there was --

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		What do you think, I don't want to pick
		up garbage?  You think I go up and down
		the street picking up garbage, I'm not
		going to pick up yours?  What's the
		matter with you?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
	
				GARBAGEMAN #1
		You don't even bundle it right, you're
		supposed to bundle it and leave it near
		the curb, you leave it near the store
		and you use cheap garbage bags, they
		smear all over the place, and then I got
		to pick it up with my shovel --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
	the window as the harangue continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		And now you're busting my chops.  You're
		just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
	up a sale.

				KATHLEEN
		That guy went ballistic on me.

				CHRISTINA
		I hope you told him off.

				KATHLEEN
		Not exactly.

	Another customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY

	A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
	passes the building under construction.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

	WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
	process of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
	hanging everywhere.

				KEVIN
		The electrical contractor called.  His
		truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
		in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
		because the shipment of pine had beetles.
		And there's some question about whether
		we're installing the stairs in the right
		spot --

				JOE
		That sounds great.

				KEVIN
		Testing one two three four.

				JOE
		Is the electrician here?

				KEVIN
		I just told you -- he hit a deer.

				JOE
		I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
		streets, just the beat of my own heart.
		I think that's the way it goes.
		Something like that.

				KEVIN
			(beginning to glean something)
		Did you and Patricia get engaged?

				JOE
		Engaged?  Are you crazy?

				KEVIN
		I thought you liked Patricia --

				JOE
		I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
		Patricia makes coffee nervous.
			(suddenly all business)
		Are we still on schedule?

				KEVIN
		We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

				JOE
		I guess we should announce ourselves
		soon.  Tell people we're coming.

				KEVIN
		This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
		The minute they hear they'll be lining up
		--

				JOE
		-- to picket --

				KEVIN
		-- the big bad --

				JOE
		--chain store --

				KEVIN
		-- that destroys --

				JOE
		-- everything we hold dear.  But we'll
		seduce them with our square footage and
		our deep armchairs and our amazingly
		swift checkout lines and our discounts
		and our...

				JOE & KEVIN
			(the trump card)
		-- cappuccino.

				JOE
		They hate us in the beginning, but we 
		get them in the end.  Meanwhile we 
		should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, 
		a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of
		Western Civilization As We Know It.

	INT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his
	grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently
	redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

	On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

				JOE
		Kevin and I are both a little concerned
		about the neighborhood response --
			(suddenly notices the garish
			 couch)
		What is this fabric?  Does it have a
		name?

				NELSON
		Money.  Its name is money.

				JOE
		Gillian selected it.

				NELSON
		Of course.

				SCHUYLER
		Your father is getting married again.

				JOE
		Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

				NELSON
		Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

				JOE
		Love.

				NELSON
		Yes, that is one reason.

				SCHUYLER
		I think you're a damn fool.

				NELSON
		Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
		for him if his parents were married.

				SCHUYLER
		Annabel is eight and I'm not married to
		her mother.  I can't even remember her
		mother's name.
			(he laughs merrily)

				JOE
		I have a very sad announcement to make.
		City Books on 23rd Street is going under
		...

	Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

				NELSON
		Another independent bookstore bites the
		dust --

				SCHUYLER
		On to the next.

				JOE
		And I'm buying their entire stock --
		architecture, New York history -- for the
		new store.

				NELSON
		How much are your paying?

				JOE
		Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
		this exquisite mohair episode.
			(indicates the couch)
		We're also going to have a section on
		West Side Writers --

				SCHUYLER
		-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

				NELSON
		Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side
		liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
		hearts --

				JOE
		Readers.  They're called readers.

				NELSON
		Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them
		from jumping down your throat --

				SCHUYLER
		What's the competition?

				JOE
		One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
		Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
		The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
		forever.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store.

				JOE
		Who's that?

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
		might have had a date once.  Or maybe we
		just exchange letters.

				JOE
		You wrote her letters?

				SCHUYLER
		Mail.  It was called mail.

				NELSON
			(fondly nostalgic and kidding
			 it slightly)
		Stamps.  Envelopes.

				JOE
		Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
		of communication before I was born.

				NELSON
		Exactly.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
		She was too young for me, but she was...
		enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

				NELSON
		Too bad for her.

	As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
	upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		Welcome.  You've got mail.

				JOE (V.O.)
		My father is getting married again.  For
		five years he's been living with a woman
		who studied decorating at Caesar's
		Palace.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		You've got mail.

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

	Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through
	the subway car.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Once I read a story about a butterfly in
		the subway, and today I saw one. I
		couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd
		--
			(continued)

	The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and got off at 59th, where I assume it
		was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat
		that will turn out to be a mistake.  As
		almost all hats are.

	EXT. H & H BAGELS - NIGHT

	A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you know that every night a truck
		pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a
		ton of flour into the ground?  The air is
		absolutely amazing.

	As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the
	air.  It is amazing.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about
		100 times --

	INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

	As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand
	it.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and every time I read it I worry that
		Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to
		get together -- but the truth is whenever
		I think about my favorite book I always
		think about the books I read as a child --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-
		time favorite children's book.
			(continued)

	She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that
	won't stop making doughnuts.

				JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine in it that
		won't stop making doughnuts, they just
		keep coming down the chute just as
		regular as a clock can tick.

	EXT. KRISPY KREME STORE - DAY

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Have you been to Krispy Kreme?
			(continued)

	Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge
	doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as
	regular as a clock can tick.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine right in the
		window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an
		hour.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Joe leaves with his morning coffee.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NEW YORK - MORNING

	Joe goes to his painter at work: COMING SOON is as far as he's
	gotten.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	She enters Starbucks.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone
	ordering.

	We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall
	mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

	The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:
	COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

	Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't
	really pay attention to the sign painter.

	We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by
	a television news truck.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

	EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

	They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an
	apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars
	and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

	George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

				TV REPORTER
		The body of a woman was found this
		morning on the roof of a New York
		building...

	As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS
	with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
	who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

				TV REPORTER
		Here is a resident of the building.  Your
		name, please?

				GEORGE
		George Pappas.

				REPORTER
		Did you see or hear anything unusual last
		night?

				GEORGE
		No.  I didn't go out.

	At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH
	CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

				REPORTER
		The victim was red-haired, about thirty-
		five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you
		encounter anyone by that description
		in the building?  Sir?

	George hasn't heard a word.

				REPORTER
		Have there been any wild parties 
		lately?

	George doesn't answer.

				REPORTER
		Could it perhaps be one of your
		neighbors?

	George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he
	does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,
	ignored, finally turns away.

				REPORTER
			(to camera)
		As you can see, no one here knows
		anything.

	He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
	Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now
	says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.

	George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
	Christina is unpacking boxes.  Birdie is at the desk.  George
	looks at Christina meaningfully.

				CHRISTINA
			(totally mystified)
		What?

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre. I had one. I
		never believed in them, but I just had
		one.

				BIRDIE
		Is that the thing where you get cold
		suddenly, bang?

				CHRISTINA
		No, that's the coup de vieux.

				BIRDIE
		I had that.

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre is where you get
		love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

				BIRDIE
		I had that too.  Only I had it in
		Seville, where it was called ,el
		estruendo de amor.

				GEORGE
		I don't know her name, or anything about
		her.  I may never see her again.

				CHRISTINA
		And if you ever do meet her, you'll find
		out all the horrible details, and that
		will be that.  She'll turn out to have
		pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the
		walls.

				GEORGE
		I won't care.

	Kathleen sticks her head into the back.

				KATHLEEN
		Can someone help me out here?

				CHRISTINA
		George had a coup de foudre.

				GEORGE
		And Christina's making fun of me.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't let her.  I believe in this, I
		completely believe in this.  It happened
		to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

				CHRISTINA
		And she was wrong every time.

				KATHLEEN
		Yes!
			(beat)
		Who was she?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  She was standing outside
		my building with the police and the
		reporters.

				KATHLEEN
		What police and reporters?

				GEORGE
		Someone died.

				KATHLEEN
		Who?

				GEORGE
		I have no idea about that either.
		They found her on the roof.

				KATHLEEN
		A dead body.  That's so sad.  But
		you fell in love.  That's so great.

				GEORGE
		Oh.  One other thing.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just
	around the corner.  A Foxbooks Superstore."

	Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.

				CHRISTINA
		Quel nightmare.

				KATHLEEN
		It has nothing to do with us. It's
		big, impersonal, overstocked and 
		full of ignorant salespeople.

				GEORGE
		But they discount.

				KATHLEEN
		But they don't provide any service.  We
		do.

	George and Christina nod.

	INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME

	Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.

				KATHLEEN
		So really it's a good development.  You
		know how in the flower district, there
		are all these flower shops in a row so
		you can find whatever you want.  Well,
		this is going to be the book district.
		If you don't have it, we do.

				BIRDIE
		And vice versa.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is
	standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric
	typewriter.

				FRANK
		When you are finished with Foxbooks, the
		Shop Around the Corner is going to be
		responsible for reversing the entire
		course of the Industrial Revolution.

				KATHLEEN
		That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.
		That is so sweet.

				FRANK
		Hey --

	He holds his arms out.  They hug.

				KATHLEEN
		Although...

				FRANK
		What?

				KATHLEEN
			(over his shoulder, she notices
			 the typewriter, breaks from
			 the hug)
		What is that doing there?

				FRANK
		Listen to it.  Just listen--

	He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

				FRANK
		The Olympia Report deluxe Electric
		Report.  As in gunshot.

				KATHLEEN
		That sound is familiar.

				FRANK
		Now listen to this.

	He puts his ear to the typewriter.

	Kathleen listens too.

				KATHLEEN
		That whirring?

				FRANK
		The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
		piece of machinery so perfect --

				KATHLEEN
		I know where I've heard it before.  I
		know.

	She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
	It's the same machine exactly.

				FRANK
		I needed a backup.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you have another one at your
		apartment?

				FRANK
		I might, I might.  So what?

				KATHLEEN
		You're turning my apartment into a
		typewriter museum.

				FRANK
		I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.
		I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,
		what were you starting to say?

				KATHLEEN
		When?

				FRANK
		Before.

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I was just wondering about
		my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do
		exactly?  All I really do is run a 
		bookstore --

				FRANK
		All you really do is this incredibly
		noble thing --

	Kathleen nods.

				KATHLEEN
		But I don't know if I --

				FRANK
			(stopping her)
		Kathleen --

				KATHLEEN
		But I just --

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed.

	Kathleen looks puzzled.

	He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed waving in the 
		breeze standing strong and tall in 
		the corrupt sands of commerce.

	He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
	it to her.

				KATHLEEN
			(reading from it)
		I am a lone reed.
			(tries it on again)
		I am a lone reed.

	Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

	We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the
	next room.

	Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes
	over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

	A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,
	walk past with a tall woman.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

	She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
	Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
	illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
	marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then
	looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer
	keys.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead
		a small life.  Well, not small, but
		circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,
		do I do it because I like it, or because
		I haven't been brave?  So much of what I
		see reminds me of something I read in a
		book, when shouldn't it be the other way
		around?
			(continued)

	And hold on her as she thinks about this.

	In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

	Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure
	barely lit by her computer.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I don't really want an answer.  I just
		want to send this cosmic question out
		into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

	INT. DRIP - DAY

	Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches
	and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  Kathleen is
	standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.

				CHRISTINA
		I went to the Foxbooks Website and you
		can buy anything.  They ship it to you
		in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

				KATHLEEN
		My mother would never have wanted us to
		have a website.  "Every book you sell is
		a gift from your heart."  She always said
		that.

	As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a 
	stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

				CHRISTINA
		What if they put us out of business?

				KATHLEEN
		It's out of the question.  We're a
		fixture in the neighborhood.  We're
		practically a landmark.
			(indicating the binders)
		Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for
		Women -- what is this?

				CHRISTINA
		You fill out one of these forms and they
		file it in the book and if someone wants
		to meet you, they arrange it.

				KATHLEEN
		What a stupid way to meet someone.

				CHRISTINA
		Compared to the Internet?

				KATHLEEN
		My little thing on the Internet is just
		a lark.

				CHRISTINA
		So it's still going on?

				KATHLEEN
		And I do not plan to meet him.
			(indicating the book)
		Why do I get the feeling that you are in
		here somewhere?

	Christina flips the book open to her application.

				CHRISTINA
		I came in here one night and drank too
		much coffee and filled one out.
			(off Kathleen's look)
		Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

				KATHLEEN
		You are a runner.  Some day you will make
		eye contact with another runner and --

				CHRISTINA
		No one ever even looks at me.  They
		don't.  On top of which, who are they?
		They could like the symphony.  I could
		never fall in love with someone who 
		likes to go to the symphony --

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  What are you supposed to do
		there?

				CHRISTINA
		I don't know.

				KATHLEEN
		Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

				CHRISTINA
		I could never fall in love with anyone
		who smokes cigars either.

				KATHLEEN
		I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs
		like stumps.

				CHRISTINA
		Yeah.  I hate that too.

				KATHLEEN
		The worst, the worst -- I could never,
		under any circumstances, love anybody
		who had a sailboat.

				CHRISTINA
		Neither could I.

				KATHLEEN
		If I had to get up on Saturday morning
		knowing that I was about to go down to
		the pier and unravel all those ropes and
		put on all that sunblock --

				CHRISTINA
		All that talk about the wind.

				KATHLEEN
		And then you have to go out on the boat,
		and you sail and sail and sail until you
		are bored witless, and then, only then,
		do they say, let's turn around and you
		realize the trip is only half over, only
		it's not, because the wind has changed --

				CHRISTINA
		It hasn't changed.  It's died.

				KATHLEEN
		So then there's more talk about the wind.
		While you just float up and down trying
		not to get nauseous.  And when you
		finally get back, you have to clean up
		the boat.

				CHRISTINA
		Why don't people have boat maids?

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  There're all these people who
		wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
		doorknob in their house but put them on 
		a boat and they want to rub down 
		everything in sight.
		
	EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and
	whistling.

				ANNABEL
		Joe --

	Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his
	grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the
	dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old
	fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

				JOE
		Hello.
			(picks up Annabel)
		Annabel, how are you today?

				ANNABEL
		Great.

				JOE
			(picks up Matt)
		Hey, big guy --

				GILLIAN
		Don't I get a hello?

				JOE
		Hello, Gillian.

				GILLIAN
		Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked
		stepmother.

	Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

				JOE
		Who is this?

				GILLIAN
		Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case
		you couldn't handle the kids.

				ANNABEL
		Maureen's getting a divorce.

				JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				MAUREEN
		It's my own fault.  Never marry a man
		who lies.

				JOE
		That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

				ANNABEL
		She taught Matt to spell his name.

				MATT
		Fox. F-O-X.

				JOE
		Excellent, Matt.
			(to Maureen)
		Good work.  You can have the day off.
		I'll take over from here.
			(to Gillian)
		You must be late for something.
		Volunteer work at the Henry Street
		Settlement.  Packing bandages for
		Bosnian refugees.  A course in 
		Chinese literature at Columbia.

				GILLIAN
		I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

	EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

	There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage
	sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the
	makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.
	Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward
	Broadway.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy
	miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store
	and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,
	including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.
	Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads 
	from a Roald Dahl book.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER

	Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is 
	showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

				KATHLEEN
		This is her best friend Tacy, whose real
		name is Anastasia, and then in the next
		book Betsy and Tacy become friends with
		Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell
		you, is Thelma.

	In another section of the store:

	George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family
	Robinson from the glass case.

				GEORGE
		The illustrations are hand-tipped,
		which is why --

				JOE
		It costs so much.

				GEORGE
		It's why it's worth so much.

	Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole
	shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

				ANNABEL
		I want all of them.

				KATHLEEN
		That might be an awful lot for your dad
		to buy at one time.

				ANNABEL
		My dad gets me all the books I want.

				KATHLEEN
			(looking over at Joe)
		Well, that's very nice of him.

				ANNABEL
		That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

				KATHLEEN
		Oh, I don't really think that's your
		nephew --

	As Joe approaches.

				JOE
		It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't
		you, Aunt Annabel?

	Annabel nods solemnly.

				ANNABEL
		And Matt is --

				KATHLEEN
		Let me guess.
			(to Matt)
		Are you his uncle?

				MATT
		No.

				KATHLEEN
		His grandfather?

	Annabel and Matt start giggling.

				KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		His great-grandfather?

				MATT
			(shouting with glee)
		I'm his brother.

				JOE
		Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
		And Matt is my father's son.  We are an
		American family.

	He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

	Annabel suddenly sneezes.

	Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old
	fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to
	Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
	looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

				ANNABEL
		What is that?

				KATHLEEN
		A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not
		even know what handkerchiefs are?  A
		handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw
		away.  My mother embroidered it for me --
		you see?  My initials and a daisy, 
		because daisies are my favorite flower.

				ANNABEL
		Orchids are my favorite flower.

				KATHLEEN
			(to Joe)
		You know what else children don't know?
		They don't know what a telephone booth
		is?

	Joe is looking at Kathleen.

				JOE
		Who are you?

				KATHLEEN
		Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.
		Are you are?

				JOE
		Joe.  Just call me Joe.
			(quickly)
		We'll take these books.

	He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen
	has gotten for Annabel.

				KATHLEEN
		These are wonderful books.  As Annabel
		gets older the characters in the books do,
		too.
			(to Annabel)
		You can grow up with Betsy.

				GEORGE
		You're going to come back again, aren't
		you?

				JOE
		Of course.

				GEORGE
		This is why we're never going to go
		under.  Our customers are loyal.

				KATHLEEN
			(by way of explanation)
		They're opening a Foxbooks around the
		corner.

				ANNABEL
		Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

				JOE
			(gently putting his hand over
			 her mouth)
		-- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell
		anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be
		proud of --

				MATT
			(spelling)
		F-O-X.

				KATHLEEN
		That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can
		you spell dog?

				MATT
		F-O-X.

			     JOE
		Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
		Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
		Annabel, maybe you could read this to
		Matt while I wrap things up here.
			(moves them to a corner, to
			 them quickly)
		Sit down, read, and don't listen to
		anything I say.

	Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

			     JOE
		And the dinosaur book too.

			     KATHLEEN
		The world is not driven by discounts,
		believe me.  I've been in business
		forever.  I started helping my mother
		here after school when I was six years
		old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't
		that she was selling books, it was that
		she was helping people become whoever
		they were going to turn out to be.  When
		you read a book as a child it becomes
		part of your identity in a way that no
		other reading in your life does.
			(stops herself)
		I guess I've gotten carried away.

			     JOE
		You have, and you've made me feel...

	He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,
	behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
	unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

			     KATHLEEN
		She was.  How did you know that?

			     JOE
		Lucky guess.

			     KATHLEEN
		Anyway.  She left the store to me, and
		I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

			     JOE
		How old is your daughter now?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

	She smiles at Joe...

			     KATHLEEN
		So Foxbooks can...

			     KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER
		Go to hell.

			     KATHLEEN
			(handing him his books)
		Here you go.

			     JOE
		We ready?

	Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them
	each a lollipop.

			     ANNABEL
		Bye, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What
		about cat?  Can you spell cat?

			     MATT
		F-O-X.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.
	PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief
	of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
	at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales
	reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with
	pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		And now, the book you've all been waiting
		for, the book it's been my dreams to
		publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
		has written her memoirs --

	There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
	flashes on screen.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- and I'm happy to report it is just
		crammed with tragedy.
			(she laughs gaily)
		Just kidding, but seriously, it's all
		here: poverty, addiction, divorce,
		tracheotomies --

	We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
	family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
	series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- her third husband beat her up, hip
		replacement, and an amazing face lift
		where all the injected fat fell to her
		chin.

	Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
	Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
	I Just Forget to Dust?"

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		This book is fabulous.  And even if it
		weren't, it would sell like crazy,
		because Veronica is going to plug it to
		death on every talk show in America.
		This book...

	Patricia bursts into tears.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
		crying.  Veronica and I have so much in
		common -- well, not all the sad parts --
		but we were both famous by the time we
		were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
			(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
			 pulling herself together)
		Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
		especially thrilled to be publishing it.
		Veronica lives in my building and we met
		in the elevator.  By the time we had
		traveled from the eighth floor to the
		first, we had a deal.  First printing:
		one million copies.

	Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

	INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales
	reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.
	Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

			     SARAH
			(quickly)
		You have a dentist appointment in twenty 
		minutes.  So you should leave soon...

			     PATRICIA
		What's my car number?

			     SARAH
		Car?  You didn't say anything about a car
		--

			     PATRICIA
		Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.
		God!

	She walks toward the exit.

	EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She
	spots one across the street.

			     PATRICIA
		Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

	She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

	The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia
	it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who
	gets into it.

			     PATRICIA
		Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is
		my taxicab.
			(to the driver)
		Don't take him.  I am telling you right
		now, and I am memorizing your number,
		don't take him.
			(to the man)
		Who the fuck do you think you are?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you going uptown?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Get in.  I'll drop you.

	INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

	As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

	Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately
	ignoring the man who stole her cab.

			     PATRICIA
		Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have
		been there, it was unbelievable, we're
		going to sell truckloads of your book.
		Call me.

	She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
	as the cab moves on.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you an editor?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I am a rabbi.

			     PATRICIA
		Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm
		sorry.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I hope you don't mind my asking, but are
		you Jewish?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		You should come to our temple.

			     PATRICIA
		I'm not really religious.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very
		religious person.

			     PATRICIA
		You're kidding, right?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		We are at West End Avenue and 83rd
		Street.  Every Friday night, we have a
		joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
		singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you
		have heard of us, we are known as The
		Singles Temple.

	He smiles at her.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		It's a very good place to calm down.

	The cab stops.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice
		to meet you.
			(gives the cabbie money)
		Take this woman to her destination.

	He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

			     PATRICIA
		Goodbye.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Frank comes up the stoop.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kathleen is dressed up for a party.

	Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.

			     FRANK
		I saw him.  I actually saw him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		I can't believe it.  I saw William
		Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought he was in Mexico.

			     FRANK
		Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in
		New York.  The most brilliant and
		reclusive novelist in the history of the
		world is here, in this neighborhood.  He
		may be living on this very block.

			     KATHLEEN
		Where did you see him?

			     FRANK
		I was on the subway --

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and this musician got onto the train --

	Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.
	The door between the cars opens and a man playing the 
	clarinet enters the car.

	No one looks up except Frank.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and I suddenly saw him, sitting
		directly across from me doing the
		crossword puzzle.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		How'd you know it was him?

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He looked exactly the same as his high
		school yearbook picture, which happens to
		be the last photograph ever taken of him.

	Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece
	of paper.

	CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

	As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
	of William Spungeon at 17.

	Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
	across the way.  They don't look remotely alike except that
	the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
	wearing the same style glasses.

	The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.
	Frank follows.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.

			     FRANK
		So I followed him.

	Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th.  He follows.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS

	Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&H Bagels passing a
	HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He went into H&H and bought a bagel
		with everything.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER

	As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we
	now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.

	Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He dropped his crossword into the 
		garbage and I rescued it.

	Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.

	INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS

	Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		Then he went into a sporting good store
		and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

	We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of
	running pants.  Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of
	joggers.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		William Spungeon and tube socks.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

	Frank looks back at the counter.  Spungeon's gone.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		And then I lost him.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

	Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.

			     FRANK
		Do you know what this is worth?

	He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the
	puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.

	INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As the two of them eat dinner.

			     FRANK
		What I was thinking as I was trailing him
		was that eventually I would have the
		courage to say hello to him, you know,
		not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
		fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
		like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you
		ever thought about trading up in the sock
		area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my
		work -- and then we'd become friends, and
		eventually I'd introduce him to you --
		you know how much he loves children's
		books, there's a whole long section in
		Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz
		-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
		so he could help save the store.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you talking about?

			     FRANK
		From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got
		tough, he could help rally support --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's never going to get to that.  The
		store is fine.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	As they walk along after dinner.

			     FRANK
		I don't even know why you would say that?

			     KATHLEEN
		Neither do I.  It just flew out of my
		mouth.

			     FRANK
		There's enough business for us all.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	As they go up in an elevator.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, we're fine.

			     FRANK
		You're more than fine, you're absolutely
		fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're fine.

	The elevator opens onto:

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI.  A mix
	of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

			     FRANK
		Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know
		Kathleen Kelly.

			     VINCE
		How are you?

			     FRANK
		Guess who I saw today on the subway?
		William Spungeon.

			     VINCE
		I thought he was in Mexico.

	They start chatting.

	Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two
	other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
	Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks
	stricken.

	Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but
	sneaks a look.

			     PATRICIA
		Would you get me another drink, sweetie?
		I'm all out.
			(continues chattering)
		So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good
		place to calm down."  Isn't that
		hysterical?

	They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

			     JOE
		Absolut on the rocks.

	As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

			     KATHLEEN
		A white wine, please.
			(very friendly)
		Oh, hello.

			     JOE
		Hi.

			     KATHLEEN
		Remember me, from the bookstore?

			     JOE
		Of course I remember you.

			     KATHLEEN
		How's your aunt?

			     JOE
		Good.  She's good.
			(gets his drink)
		I have to deliver this.  I have a very
		thirsty date.  She's part camel.

	Kathleen laughs.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

			     JOE
		And you're Kathleen.

	Joe vanishes into the party.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER

			     VINCE
		I can't believe you were talking to Joe
		Fox.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe Fox?  As in --

	She can't even finish the sentence.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

	Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

	Joe spins around, looks at her.

			     JOE
		F-O-X.

			     KATHLEEN
		God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who
		you --
			(she trails off)

			     JOE
		-- were with.
			(quoting)
		"I didn't know who you were with."

			     KATHLEEN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		It's from the Godfather.  When the movie
		producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the
		emissary of Vito Corleone --
			(continued)

	Kathleen is staring at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		-- just before the horse's head ends up
		in his bed never mind --

			     KATHLEEN
		You were spying on me, weren't you?  You
		probably rented those children.

			     JOE
		Why would I spy on you?

			     KATHLEEN
		I am your competition.  Which you know
		perfectly well or you would not have put
		up that sign saying "Just around the
		Corner."

			     JOE
		The entrance to our store is around the
		corner.  There is no other way to say it.
		It's not the name of our store, it's
		where it is.  You don't own "around the
		corner."

			     KATHLEEN
		Next thing you'll be using twinkle
		lights.

			     JOE
		Twinkle lights?

			     KATHLEEN
		Little white Christmas lights that
		twinkle.  I use them in my window and on
		all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

			     JOE
		Look, the reason I came into your store
		is that I was spending the day with
		Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a
		present when I see them because I'm one
		of those guys who likes to buy his way
		into the hearts of children who are his
		relatives.  There was only one place to
		buy children's books in the neighborhood
		-- although that will not always be the
		case, and it was yours, and it is a
		charming little bookstore.  You probably
		sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

			     KATHLEEN
		How do you know that?

			     JOE
		I'm in the book business.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm in the book business --

			     JOE
		Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.
		Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
		oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
		your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
		books.  Me a spy.
			(beat)
		Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands
		on a secret printout of the sales figures
		of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
		full of its own virtue that I was instantly
		compelled to rush over and check it out
		for fear it would drive me out of business 
		--

	Kathleen stares at him.  She's speechless.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		What?
			(off her look)
		What?

	Kathleen shakes her head.

	Frank turns up.

			     FRANK
		Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

			     JOE
		-- Joe Fox.

			     FRANK
		Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,
		enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
		City Books -- tell me something:
		How do you sleep at night?

	Patricia joins them.

			     PATRICIA
		I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
		Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,
		just half, and you will wake up without
		even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank
		Navasky, aren't you?

			     FRANK
		Yes.

			     PATRICIA
		Your last piece in the Independent, the
		one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.
		I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this
		man is the greatest living expert on
		Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

			     JOE
		And this is Kathleen Kelly --

	Kathleen glares at him.

			     FRANK
		You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.
		You know you write these things and you
		think someone's going to mention them and
		then the whole week goes by and the phone
		doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm
		a fraud, a failure --

			     PATRICIA
		You know what's always fascinated me
		about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how
		old they looked when they were really
		just our age.

	Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
	Patricia, who smiles at them all.

			     PATRICIA
			(to Frank)
		I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We
		will talk.  Have you ever thought about
		doing a book?

			     FRANK
		Oh sure, it's passed through my head.
		Something really relevant for today like
		the Luddite movement in 19th century
		England.

	At the same time:

			     JOE
		Patricia --

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.

			     FRANK
		I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a
		very nice person.

	Kathleen doesn't respond.  Frank turns out the light.

			     FRANK
		She needs educating, that's all.

	A beat.

			     FRANK
		She's hopelessly driven by money and
		power, but there's a hope for anyone 
		who's that familiar with my work --

	On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,
	eyes open.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Joe and Patricia get into bed.  Brinkley is already on the
	bed.

			     PATRICIA
		I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so
		down-to-earth.

	Joe doesn't respond.  Patricia turns out the light.

			     PATRICIA
		You read his stuff, you think he's going
		to be so obscure and abstruse.

	A beat.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		He's always talking about Heidigger and
		Foucault and I have no idea what any of
		it's about, really.

	Joe gets up.  Brinkley follows.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		I'm not really tired.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe writes on his computer.  Brinkley on the floor next to him.

	And cut between Joe and his computer screen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Do you ever feel you become the worst
		version of yourself?  That a Pandora's
		Box of all the secret hateful parts --
		your arrogance, your spite, your
		condescension -- has sprung open.
		Someone provokes you, and instead of 
		just smiling and moving on, you zing 
		them.  Hello, it's Mr. Nasty.  I'm sure 
		you have no idea what I'm talking about.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	And cut between screen and

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.

	Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know what you mean and I'm completely
		jealous.  What happens to me when I'm
		provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My
		mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night
		tossing and turning trying to think of
		what I should have said.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	As he replies:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass
		all my zingers to you and then I would
		never behave badly and you could behave
		badly all the time and we'd both be
		happy?  On the other hand, I must warn
		you that when you finally have the
		pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
		say at the moment you mean to say it,
		remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think
		we should meet?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.

	She's frozen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Meet?  Omigod.

	She sits staring at the letter.  She has no idea what to do.

	EXT. 75TH STREET & COLUMBUS - DAY

	As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
	way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
	The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.
	The video store.

	And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks
	Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate
	on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost
	soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON
	ALL BEST-SELLERS.

	People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

	CAMERA follows him...

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,
	comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone
	decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the
	alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven
	cash registers with seven cashiers.  Of course, books, books,
	books, as far as the eye can see.

	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY

	The store is jam-packed.  Joe with his father Nelson, his
	grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.

			     JOE
		No pickets, no demonstrations.

			     KEVIN
		The neighborhood loves us.

			     NELSON
		They're wondering where we've been all
		these years.  They're wondering how they
		ever did without it.

			     SCHUYLER
		It's a hit.

	They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
	start up the staircase to the second floor.

			     NELSON
		How's the children's book department?

			     JOE
		It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And
		there's that children's bookstore nearby
		--

			     SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store --

			     JOE
		Her daughter's --

			     NELSON
		We'll crush it --

			     SCHUYLER
		She was enchanting.

	And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
	come up the stairs behind them.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the
	street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
	paper.  Joe is at the newsstand.  She turns and pretends to
	be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
	walks on.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think it's a good idea for us
		to meet...

	INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as
	Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I love our relationship.  There's a lot
		going on in the day-to-dayness of my life
		and there's something magical...

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting
	the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.
	Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving
	decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
	colonists like Myles Standish.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		... and thrilling about this island in
		cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE
		DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

			     BIRDIE
		About $1200 less than the same week last
		year.

			     KATHLEEN
		That could be a fluke, right?

	They look at each other.

			     BIRDIE
		Or not.

			     KATHLEEN
		Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But
		it will all shake out.  Do you think I
		should put up more twinkle lights?

			     BIRDIE
		That's a lovely idea.

			     CHRISTINA
		What if we have to fold?  I'll never find
		another part time job and I won't be able
		to pay the rent and I'll have to move to
		Brooklyn.

			     GEORGE
		The joy of rent control.  Six room for
		$450 a month.

			     CHRISTINA
		We know.  You've told us a million times.
		I can't believe you're bringing it up at
		a time like this.  It's like bragging
		because you're tall.  Birdie never brags
		about her rent and she pays even less
		than you.

			     BIRDIE
		Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one
		to the other.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

	The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had
	swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

	George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

			     MEREDITH
		George Pappas?

			     GEORGE
			(I have died and gone to
			 heaven)
		Yes.

			     MEREDITH
			(flashing her badge)
		Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd
		like to ask you a few questions.

	Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the
	store.  He's in a complete daze.

			     KATHLEEN
		George?  Where are you going?

	He goes out the door.

	LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters
	as George leaves.

			     LAURA
		Kathleen, are you surviving?

			     KATHLEEN
		Laura!  We're so excited about your new
		book.  When should we schedule your
		signing?

			     LAURA
		Oh, it's being published in January.
		Are you going to be in business in
		January?  I'm so worried.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're doing great, aren't we?

			     CHRISTINA
		Great.

			     BIRDIE
		No difference whatsoever.

			     LAURA
		Thank God.  Well, you know you can count
		on me.  For anything, support, rallies.
		Picket lines.  We can get the Times to
		write something.  Or that nut in the
		Independent --

			     KATHLEEN
		What nut in the Independent?

			     LAURA
		Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of
		thing that would outrage him.

	She smiles brightly.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

			     MEREDITH
		Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder
		of the woman found on the roof of your
		building.  Do you live alone there?

			     GEORGE
		Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live
		alone?

			     MEREDITH
		Yes.

	George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
	the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,
	caressing it...

	Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right
	back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each
	other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

		MEREDITH
			(overwhelmed)
		What are you doing?

			     GEORGE
		I don't know.  I have no idea.

			     MEREDITH
		You have to stop.

			     GEORGE
		I can't.

	She utters a little moan.

	INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his
	arms.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY

	As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact
	with men running in the opposite direction.  No one will look
	at her.

	INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

	The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
	Thanksgiving.

	Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
	through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches
	across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into
	the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
	She stands there frozen.  A beat...

	Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this
	way and that.  No Joe.

	INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all
	disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a
	beeline for it.

	At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and
	gets on the line she was heading for.

	Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with
	her back to him.

	INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

	The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands
	over her credit card.

			     CASHIER
		This is a Cash Only line.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     CASHIER
		Cash Only.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is
		that okay?

			     PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE
		Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

			     CASHIER
		There's a sign.

			     PERSON IN LINE
			(to the person behind her)
		She doesn't have cash.

	"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the
	line.

	Joe turns to see what's going on.

			     ANOTHER PERSON
		Get on another line, lady.

			     JOE
		Oh, hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hello.

			     JOE
		Do you need some money?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I don't need any money.  Thank you
		very much.

			     CASHIER
		Get on another line.

			     JOE
		Hi.
			(off her nametag, big smile)
		Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is
		Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit
		card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

	Rose just stares at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Now it's your turn to say happy
		Thanksgiving back.

			     ROSE
		Happy Thanksgiving back.

	Joe looks at her, winks.

			     JOE
		Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How
		do you spell it?  I-T.
			(big smile)
		Now take this credit card and put it
		through the machine, zip zip.

	The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit
	card.

	Kathleen is appalled.

	Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

			     JOE
		So you're fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fine.

			     JOE
		Happy Thanksgiving.

	As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly
	starts to put her groceries into a bag.

	INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

	An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish
	French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,
	and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.

			     ANNABEL
		The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
		bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
		sun --

	Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits
	down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.
	Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
	and can't see her without turning around.

	As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to
	Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees
	Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers
	her his seat.  She sits.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the
	leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's
	living room.

	Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new
	girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing
	around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas
	song, and everyone is singing.

	As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

	As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the
	window.

	Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the
	customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

	"Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author
	Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

	Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
	lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a
	tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

	Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
	carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.

	Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
	starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
	computer.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		This is such an odd Christmas.  I find
		myself missing my mother, who's been dead
		for ten years.  New York at Christmas is
		so loaded with all the things we used to
		do --

	INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY

	As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in
	the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- going to the Nutcracker --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - 1972 - DAY

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,
		where I was knocked into a 6-year-old
		maniac --

	A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.

			     YOUNG KATHLEEN
		Hey, watch out --

			     SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY
		Me watch out, why don't you watch out?
		I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You
		think I come here to skate with babies?

	Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My first experience as a speechless
		person.

	Her mother skates up and takes her hand.  The boy skates off.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I always miss my mother at Christmas, but
		somehow it's worse this year since I need
		some advice from her.

	And we hear the sound of another computer.

	INT. JOE'S DEN

	As he replies to Kathleen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		My mother took me ice skating too --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY

	We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's
	hand --

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		-- although my mother did not skate.  The
		nanny skated --

	And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly
	peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER
	absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.

	INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY

			     JOE (V.O.)
		And I was in the Nutcracker.

	We see the stage now.  There's Young Joe, among the children
	at the Christmas party.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		So was my nanny.

	As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Different nanny.  By the way, I'm
		surprised you aren't a writer.  Although
		you probably are a writer and don't
		know it.  Are you a writer and I don't 
		know it?

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT

	Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot
	of a big room with a huge table and servants.  Joe looks very
	small at the table as he eats his soup.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		My mother died when I was ten.  I was
		staying with my father, who is not famous
		for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
		the news of her death was to tell me she
		would not be coming to pick me up as
		usual.  It was a car accident, and I
		don't know where she was going or who she
		was with, and I assume what I owe her is
		my tendency to cover almost any emotion
		with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you
		want to know what you're feeling.  She
		was very beautiful.  People toss that
		word around a lot, but my mother was.

	The camera moves closer to the dining table.  We see that
	tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.
	A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved
	himself to tears.  Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
	Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Ancient history.  So what kind of advice
		do you need?  Can I help?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter.

	She starts to type a response.

	Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message
	flashes on screen.

	From NY 152

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - TOTAL SHOCK

	ON SCREEN AS WE SEE THE MESSAGE

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I had a gut feeling you would be on line
		now.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Joe is in bed with his laptop.  And cut back and forth
	between them and their computer screens as they type Instant
	Messages to one another.  Possible split screens.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		I can give you advice.  I'm great at
		advice.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think you can help.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Is it about love?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My business is in trouble.  My mother
		would have something wise to say.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what
		I do best.  What's your business?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		No specifics, remember?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Minus specifics, it's hard to help.
		Except to say, go to the mattresses.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		It's from The Godfather.  It means you
		have to go to war.

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		The Godfather?

	She starts to type.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What is it with men and The Godfather?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		The Godfather is the I Ching.  The
		Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The
		Godfather is the answer to any question.
		What should I pack for my summer
		vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the
		cannoli."  What day of the week is it?
		"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."
		And the answer to your question is "Go to
		the mattresses."
			(continued)

	CAMERA ON KATHLEEN - CONSIDERING WHAT HE SAYS

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's
		business.  It's not personal it's
		business."  Recite that to yourself every
		time you feel you're losing your nerve.
		I know you worry about being brave, this
		is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the
		death.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.

			     PATRICIA
		Look what I bought.

	Joe types "Ciao" and signs off.  Looks up to see Patricia
	showing him a Plexiglas menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I was just passing this store on Columbus
		Avenue and it caught my eye.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     PATRICIA
		A Menorah.
			     JOE
		It doesn't look like a Menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I know.  I don't know what came over me.
		I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank, I've decided to go to the
		mattresses.  Do you think it would be a
		gigantic conflict of interest if you
		wrote something about us?

	INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	It's January.  The store is more crowded than we've seen it.
	Frank is there with several copies of the Independent.  The
	phone is ringing off the hook.  Christina and George are
	fielding calls.  Birdie is reading Frank's article.

			     BIRDIE
			(reading)
		"Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia
		Kelly have raised your children.  If this
		precious resource is killed by the cold
		cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be
		the end of Western civilization as we
		know it, but the end of something even
		dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
		Save the Shop Around the Corner and you
		will save your own soul."  Frank, that's
		charming.

			     FRANK
		You think it's a little over the top?

			     BIRDIE
		Just say thank you.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     CHRISTINA
			(calling to Kathleen)
		Channel 2's outside.

	INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME

	Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror.  She takes a deep
	breath.

			     KATHLEEN
		In a second.

			     GEORGE
			(from the other room)
		The Village Voice is coming.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod.

	Frank sticks his head in.

			     FRANK
			(in shock)
		It's him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		God. It is God.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen comes out of the storage room.

	William Spungeon is standing there.

			     WILLIAM SPUNGEON
		I'm William Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm
		Kathleen Kelly.

	Frank is practically levitating.

			     SPUNGEON
		I knew your mother.  Although she knew me
		only as W.  That enormous bookstore is
		obscene.

			     FRANK
		I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture
		in my wallet.

	He pulls it out.  Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

			     KATHLEEN
		We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is
		doing a special.

			     SPUNGEON
		I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
		all right with you.  They've been trying
		to interview me for years.

			     FRANK
		The press?  I'm the press.

			     KATHLEEN
		You'd allow that?  For me?  For the
		store?  That's incredible.  Although you
		wouldn't have to be photographed.  I
		respect that.  If it's television, they
		could just put one of those blurry dots
		in front of your face.

			     SPUNGEON
		No television.

			     CHRISTINA
			(referring to the TV crew)
		They're waiting for you --

			     FRANK
		I know all your books.  Phaelox the
		gnome, the little man who comes from
		nowhere... and is going nowhere...
			(quoting)
		"Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."
		"Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

			     SPUNGEON
		Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in
		hives.
			(to Kathleen)
		Here's my phone number.

			     KATHLEEN
		I had no idea William Spugeon had a
		phone.

			     SPUNGEON
		Adios.

	He gives a little wave and leaves.

			     FRANK
		This is historic.
			(beat)
		Do you realize what I've done?  By
		writing that piece, do you realize?
		I've brought William Spungeon in from
		the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely
		amazing.

	At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.

			     TV REPORTER
		Kathleen Kelly?

	Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

			     KATHLEEN
		Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		We're here in front of the Shop Around
		the Corner, the famous West Side
		children's bookstore now on the verge of
		having to close its doors because the big
		bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few
		hundred feet away, wooing customers with
		its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

			     KATHLEEN
		They have to have discounts and lattes,
		because most of the people who work there
		have never read a book.

	And pull back now to reveal that we're in:

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and
	Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

			     JOE
		She's not as nice as she seems on
		television.

			     KEVIN
		You've met her?

			     JOE
		She's kind of a pill.

			     KEVIN
		She's probably not as attractive as she
		seems on television either.

			     JOE
		No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

			     KEVIN
		So you don't feel bad about basically
		destroying her livelihood not to mention
		her legacy not to mention her raison
		d'etre.

			     JOE
		It's not personal --

			     KEVIN
		It's business.

			     JOE
		Right.  Exactly.

	They look up at the television.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

	Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.

			     JOE
		I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell
		cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
		to this, because it's really bad --
		more people can buy books.

	The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

	On Joe and Kevin.

			     KEVIN
		That's what you said?

			     JOE
			(outraged)
		That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't
		believe those bastards -- I said we were
		great, I said people can come and sit and
		read for hours and no one bothers them, I
		said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed
		them the New York City section.  I said
		we were a goddamn piazza where people
		could mingle and mix and be.

			     KEVIN
		A piazza?

			     JOE
		I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just
		inevitable, isn't it?  People are going
		to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

			     KEVIN
		-- and you into Attila the Hun.

			     JOE
		Well it's not me personally, it's more
		like it's the company --

			     KATHLEEN
			(on the television)
		And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,
		who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him
		compared his store to a Price Club and the
		books in it to cans of olive oil.

	On Joe, reacting.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	A small rally is taking place, with picket signs.  Kathleen
	is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the
	Borough President.

			     KATHLEEN
		My mother used to say to me that every
		book you sell is a gift from the
		heart...

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY

	As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little
	makeshift picket signs and singing songs.  "One, two, three,
	four, we don't want this Superstore."

	Customers go right through the line and into the store.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
	although the store is full of customers anyway.  The Fox men
	-- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
	Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
	old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the
	front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from
	Hiding to Support Bookstore.

			     SCHUYLER
		Who is this Spungeon anyway?

			     JOE
		He's a writer.

			     NELSON
		Well, I've never heard of him.  And
		neither has anyone else in this place.

	INT. TV SET - NIGHT

	As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS
	talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		The New York Literary world was shocked
		this week when William Spungeon, the most
		famously reclusive author since J.D.
		Salinger, announced that he was coming
		out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
		small children's bookstore on the West
		Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this
		tonight is a man I happen to think of as
		one of this city's most underappreciated
		assets, Frank Navasky.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		This all happened because of you, didn't
		it --

			     FRANK
		Well, I knew William Spungeon loved
		children's books so I wrote a provocative
		column --

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		Your specialty.

	Frank laughs.  Sidney-Ann laughs.

			     FRANK
		And it kind of smoked him out.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she and Frank watch the television show.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Technologically speaking, the world's 
		out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole
		idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible
		for you to tape what's on television
		while you're out of the house.  But the
		whole point of being out of the house is
		so you can miss what's on television.
		Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get
		behind.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Well, we're on television... and you're
		good at it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Thank you.

	Another little moment between them.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Are you planning to collect radios?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Do you think I should?

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		The Shop Around the Corner is a true New
		York treasure.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Any time.  Are we done?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Not at all.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Because I just want to say that the only
		show I do watch is yours.

			     KATHLEEN
			(appalled)
		Omigod.

			     FRANK
		Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I
		admit, I slobbered all over her.

	The show continues.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up
	the week's receipts.

			     GEORGE
		And I can't decide whether to put
		sausages into the meat sauce or just
		chopped meat.  Last time I made it,
		Detective Carter and I never even sat
		down to dinner because --
			(he makes some sort of hand
			 gesture indicating that sex
			 prevented them from dining)
		and last night, I made margaritas in the
		blender, and I took the ice cube and --

			     BIRDIE
		Spare us.

	George goes out the door.

	Birdie looks at Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't tell me.  Not the slightest
		difference?

	Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		How could that be?  All this publicity
		and not one bit of difference?
		Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What
		would Mom have done?

			     BIRDIE
		Let's ask her.

	She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a
	picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the
	locket up to her face.

			     BIRDIE
		Cecilia, what should we do?

	Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Shhhh.
			(after a beat, shrugs)
		She has no idea, but she thinks the
		window display is lovely.  Good night
		dearie.

	Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
	door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

	It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the
	store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in
	her path out of the shadows.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you
		doing here.

			     SPUNGEON
		Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.
		Stalking.

	He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an
	umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

			     SPUNGEON (cont'd)
		You look very beautiful.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

	He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he
	blows on his hand.

			     SPUNGEON
		An eyelash.  It's gone.

	Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you writing another book?

			     SPUNGEON
		I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in
		approximately six more years.

			     KATHLEEN
		Should I discount?

			     SPUNGEON
		It's about a man on a quest for knowledge
		who meets a woman he cannot resist.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I discount I have to fire someone
		because I can't discount with this
		overhead but whom could I fire?  I
		couldn't fire anyone.

	Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She
	stops, frozen in place.

			     SPUNGEON
		You have your mother's hair.  Thick,
		wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

	He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing?  Let me go.

	He backs her into a wall.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop it.  Are you crazy?

	She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.

		We're meeting in a public place.

		Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't
		even go out to the street with him
		afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit
		there and wait for you.

			     GEORGE
		Did you tell Frank?

			     KATHLEEN
		There's nothing to tell.

			     CHRISTINA
		But did you tell him?

			     KATHLEEN
		He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of
		the Chicago Seven trial.

			     GEORGE
		And he's gone to a place where there are

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

		And you're going to meet him in a bar?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the

			     GEORGE
		And he will wear a flower in his lapel,
		and you will be carrying a copy of Anna

	No answer.

		Not really.

		Really.

			     KEVIN
		Which Jane Austen is it?

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

		Walk me there, okay?

	EXT. 83RD STREET - NIGHT

	As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on
	West 83rd Street.

			     JOE
		What if she has a really high, squeaky

		those mice in Cinderella.

			     KEVIN
		What mice in Cinderella?

			     JOE
		Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the
		other one.  Why am I compelled to meet

			     KEVIN
		You're taking it to the next level.  I
		always do that.  I always take a
		relationship to the next level, and if it
		works okay I take it to the next level
		after that, until I can finally get to
		the level where it becomes absolutely
		necessary for me to leave.

			     JOE
		I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I
		already said that, didn't I.  Christ.
		I'm a total wreck.

	As they reach:

	EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Joe stops and looks at Kevin.

			     JOE
		Kevin, this woman is the most adorable

		crazy not to turn my life upside down

			     JOE
			(a total panic)
		You go look.

		But no book.  Let me see, let me see...
		Wait a minute.  There's a book with a

			     JOE
		What does he look like?

			     KEVIN
		There's a waiter blocking, I can't see

		Well, why shouldn't she?

			     KEVIN
		No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.
		Oh, he's moving.

			     JOE
		Can you see her?

			     KEVIN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		And? --

			     KEVIN
			(clearly frustrated)
		She's very pretty.

			     JOE
		She is.  I knew she would be.  She had
		to be.

			     KEVIN
		She looks... I would say she has a little
		of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly
		person.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

			     KEVIN
		Why not?  You said you thought she was
		attractive.

			     JOE
		So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

			     KEVIN
		Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,
		I can tell you right now you ain't gonna
		like this girl.

			     JOE
		Why not?

			     KEVIN
		Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

	Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.

		Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you
		tomorrow.

	He walks away, leaving Kevin.

	Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other
	direction.

	INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
	tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks
	her watch.

	A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
	to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the
	empty chair at Kathleen's table.

			     MAN
		Do you mind?

	Kathleen jumps up.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.
		Please.

	She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the
	group as they playfully fight over the menus.

	She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride
	and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

	A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
	him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

	As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
	onto the floor.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh!

	She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
	precious china.

	In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as
	she rearranges the book and the flower.

	He disappears from sight.

	A beat...

	He walks in the door.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a
		coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

	Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

	Kathleen grabs it back.

			     KATHLEEN
		Do you mind?

	She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

			     JOE
		I didn't know you were a Jane Austen
		fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet
		you read it every year.  I bet you just
		love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental
		heart beats wildly at the thought that he
		and whatever her name is are really,
		honestly and truly going to end up
		together.

			     KATHLEEN
		Would you please leave?

	Joe sits down.

			     KATHLEEN
		Please?

			     JOE
		I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
		Is he late?

			     KATHLEEN
		The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is
		Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the
		greatest, most complex characters ever
		written, not that you would know.

			     JOE
		As a matter of fact I've read it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well, good for you.

			     JOE
		I think you'd discover a lot of things if
		you really knew me.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I really knew you, I know what I would
		find -- instead of a brain, a cash
		register, instead of a heart, a bottom
		line.

	Kathleen is shocked at herself.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     KATHLEEN
		I just had a breakthrough, and I have to
		thank you for it.  For the first time in
		my life, when confronted with a horrible,
		insensitive person I actually knew what I
		wanted to say and I said it.

			     JOE
		I think you have a gift for it.  It was a
		splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


			     KATHLEEN
		Meanness?  Let me tell you --

			     JOE
		Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying
		you a compliment.

	He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why are you doing this?

	She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

			     JOE
		What have we have?  A red, no, crimson
		rose, tucked into the pages.  Something
		you read about in a book, no doubt.  One
		of those books with a lady in a nightgown
		on the cover about to throw herself off a
		cliff.

	She holds her hand out for it.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Give it to me.

	Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

			     JOE
		It's a joke to you, isn't it?
		Everything's a joke to you.

	She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Please leave.  I beg you.

	He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
	next table, with his back to her.

	The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it
	hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
	by a pleasant looking woman.

	For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
	wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her
	compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look
	behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He
	turns away suddenly.

	Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

			     JOE
		You know what the handkerchief reminds
		me of?  The first day I met you --

			     KATHLEEN
		The first day you lied to me --

			     JOE
		I didn't lie to you --

			     KATHLEEN
		You did too --

			     JOE
		I did not --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought all that Fox stuff was so
		charming.  F-O-X.

			     JOE
		I never lied about it --

			     KATHLEEN
		"Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were
		one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
		with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."
		"Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with
		them?  Don't they know you're supposed to
		have last names?  It's like they're a
		whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

	She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
	on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
	table.

			     JOE
		I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

			     KATHLEEN
		That's not what I meant --

			     JOE
		And when I said the thing about the Price
		Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
		what I meant either --

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I
		feel so sorry for you.

	The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
	in a boa comes in the door.

			     JOE
		I am going to take a wild guess that this
		isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.
		Not, I gather, the world's greatest
		living expert on Julius and Ethel
		Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
		Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will
		you start out sweet as sugar candy and
		then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
		from the blue, find that sharp little 
		tongue of yours?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I won't.  Because the man who's
		coming here tonight is completely unlike
		you.  The man who is coming here is kind
		and funny -- he has the most wonderful
		sense of humor --

			     JOE
		But he's not here.

			     KATHLEEN
		If he's not here, he has a reason,
		because there is not a cruel or careless
		bone in his body.  I can't expect you to
		know anything about a person like that.
		You've nothing but a suit.

	A beat.  Joe gets up.

			     JOE
		That is my cue.  Good night.

	Joe leaves.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT

	Kathleen comes down the street.  She drops the rose in the
	trash can.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

	Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her
	coat and goes immediately to the computer.  She clicks on
	American Online.  Waits impatiently to connect.  Looks with
	anticipation at the mail box.

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

	Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

	She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
	face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and
	tosses it over her shoulder.

	She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
	her shoes.

	Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches
	up to turn out the light.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.
	The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates
	the room.

	Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.

			     PATRICIA (O.C.)
		So I said to her, "If you think I will
		even talk to you about paying that kind
		of advance for an author whose last book
		is being used as trivets all over the
		world, you are completely crazy."

	On Joe's face, barely bearing.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	As Kevin and Joe walk through the store.

			     KEVIN
		But underneath that disagreeable exterior
		she could turn out to be --

			     JOE
		A real bitch.  Let's not talk about it.
		I'm going back to the office.  You must
		have work to do.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.  This place is humming like a
		top.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen comes around the corner.  Christina is waiting.

			     CHRISTINA
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He never came.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood you up?

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think something happened, something
		terrible and unexpected that made it
		impossible for him --

	George walks in.

			     GEORGE
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He wasn't able to make it.

			     GEORGE
		He stood you up.

			     KATHLEEN
		What could have happened?
			(continued)

	George looks suddenly stricken.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,
		took one look at me and left.

			     CHRISTINA
		Not possible.

			     KATHLEEN
		Maybe there was a subway accident.

			     CHRISTINA
		Absolutely.

			     KATHLEEN
		A train was trapped underground with him
		inside.

			     CHRISTINA
		And no phone.

	George continues to look stricken.  He's starting to shake
	his head.

			     KATHLEEN
		Or an automobile accident.  Those cab
		drivers are maniacs.

			     CHRISTINA
		They hit something and you slam right
		into that plastic partition.

			     KATHLEEN
		His elbows could be in splints -- so he
		can't really dial --

			     CHRISTINA
		Or he could be in the hospital in one of
		those semi-private room with like --
			     
			     CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN
			(together)
		-- no phone.

	They look at George.  Still shaking his head.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to George)
		What?

	George hands them a New York Post.  They look at the cover:
	COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you saying?

			     GEORGE
		It could be.

	Dead silence.

			     GEORGE (cont'd)
		He was arrested two blocks from the
		cheesecake place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Is there a picture?

	There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
	head.

	They all look at it.

			     CHRISTINA
		So that explains it.

			     GEORGE
		He was in jail.

			     CHRISTINA
		And there was a phone --

			     GEORGE
		-- but he got only one call and he had to
		use it to call his lawyer.

			     CHRISTINA
		You are so lucky.

			     GEORGE
		You could be dead.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you crazy?  This man couldn't
		possibly be the rooftop killer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Remember when you thought Frank might be
		the Unabomber?

			     KATHLEEN
		That was different.

			     CHRISTINA
		How long did you sit there all alone?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

			     CHRISTINA
		Joe Fox!

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't want to talk about it.
			(closes her eyes)
		Let's get to work.

	They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to
	do.

	A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		There must be something to do.  There's
		always something to do.

	They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully
	toward it.  It's only Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood her up.

	Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about you.  Last
		night I went to meet you and you weren't
		there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so
		foolish.
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we
	hear a voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		And as I waited, someone else showed up,
		a man who has made my professional life a
		misery, and an amazing thing happened --
		I was able, for the first time in my
		life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say
		it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt
		terrible.  Just as you said I would.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

	The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And
		even though I can hardly believe what I
		said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm
		just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
		it did?  No matter what he's done to me,
		there's no excuse for my behavior.
		Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so
		wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a
		good reason for not being there last
		night, but if you don't, and if we never
		really connect again, I just want to tell
		you how much it has meant to me to know
		you were there.

	Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.
	Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

			     COMPUTER
		Goodbye.

	Joe stands and leaves the room.

	The computer sits there.

	Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator 
	door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes
	the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he
	comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts
	for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.
	He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

	Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I am in Vancouver.

	He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.
	He starts typing again:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I was stuck in a meeting, which I
		couldn't get out of it, and there was
		no phone.

	He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

	Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't
	get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he
	starts typing.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		The electricity went out in the building
		and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
		the telephone system blew too.

	He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Amazingly enough.

	He sits looking at it.

	Then he deletes the whole thing.

	Sits looking at the blank screen.

			     JOE
		Fuck you.

	He clicks the Yes box.

	Then he starts to type again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Dear friend: I cannot tell you what
		happened to me last night, but I beg you
		from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
		for not being there.

	He deletes "for not being there."

	Then types again, after "to forgive me".

			     JOE (V.O.)
		-- for what happened.  I feel terrible
		that you found yourself in a situation
		that caused you additional pain.  But I'm
		absolutely sure that whatever you said
		last night was provoked, even deserved.
		And everyone says things they regret when
		they're worried or stressed.  You were
		expecting to see someone you trusted and
		met the enemy instead.  The fault is
		mine.
			(continued)

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Someday I'll explain everything.
		Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

			     CHRISTINA
		Did he say anything about meeting again?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll
		just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.
		Patrick Campbell and write letters our
		whole lives --

	They go into an apartment building.

	INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A large rent-controlled West Side apartment.  Birdie is 
	pouring tea.  There's a plate of cookies.

	Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young
	woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.

			     CHRISTINA
		Where was this taken, Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Seville.

			     KATHLEEN
		When you had the thunderbolt?

			     BIRDIE
		Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

			     KATHLEEN
		Close.  We're going to close.

			     CHRISTINA
		Close.

			     KATHLEEN
		Although it feels like such a failure.
		It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels
		like... Mom...

	She closes her eyes.

	Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her
	arms around her.  Hold on them.

			     BIRDIE
		Keeping the store open doesn't keep your
		mother alive, although sometimes I think
		we all think it does.

	Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the
		thunderbolt over?

	Birdie shakes her head.  She's not going to tell them.

			     CHRISTINA (cont'd)
		It's so romantic.

			     BIRDIE
		But it wasn't meant to be.

			     CHRISTINA
		Why not?

			     BIRDIE
		He ran Spain.

			     CHRISTINA
		Spain?

			     BIRDIE
		The country.  He ran it.  That was his
		job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT

	As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
	movie.

			     FRANK
		She fell in love with Generalissimo
		Franco?

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't say that.  We don't know that for
		sure.

			     FRANK
		Who else could it have been?  It was
		probably around 1960 --

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, it's not like he was something
		normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
		or something --

			     FRANK
		It happened in Spain.  People do really
		stupid things in foreign countries.

			     KATHLEEN
		Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,
		they go see Flamenco, they ride in
		gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
		guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but
		they don't fall in love with fascist
		dictators.

	They enters one of the theatres.

	INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

	As they find seats and sit down.  A trailer is playing.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie is a very kind person, she's
		practically my surrogate mother.

			     FRANK
		Well she's out of her mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		She is not.

			     FRANK
		I could never ever be with anyone who
		doesn't take politics as seriously as I
		do.

	The person in front of them turns around.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Do you mind?

			     FRANK
		A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet
		while a hot dog is singing?

	The two of them sit there.

			     KATHLEEN
		I have something to tell you.  I didn't
		vote.

			     FRANK
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		In the last mayoral election, when Rudy
		Giuliani was running against Ruth
		Messinger, I went to get a manicure and
		forgot to vote.

			     FRANK
		Since when do you get manicures?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I suppose you could never be with a
		woman who gets manicures.

			     FRANK
		Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Shhhhhh.

			     KATHLEEN
		You forgive me.

	Hold on them a beat.

	Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT

	Kathleen on the down escalator.  Frank scrambling to catch up
	with her.

			     FRANK
		What's going on?

	Kathleen's upset.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		Hey.  What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As they walk uptown.

			     FRANK
		Look, this has been a big week, you're
		closing the store --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not that, Frank, really it's not.
		It's just... Frank...

			     FRANK
		I know, that was terrible of me.

			     KATHLEEN
		What was?

			     FRANK
		To jump all over you when I'm the one
		who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know
		how to say this --

			     KATHLEEN
		What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-
	in extension of a restaurant.

	INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.

			     FRANK
		You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		So are you.

			     FRANK
		And I'm honored that you want to be with
		me because you would never be with anyone
		who wasn't truly worthy --

			     KATHLEEN
		I feel exactly the same way about you.

			     FRANK
		Oh, God, don't say that, please, that
		just makes it worse.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?
			(he shakes his head)
		You don't love me?

	Frank shakes his head no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Me either.

			     FRANK
		You don't love me?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     FRANK
		But we're so right for each other.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		That woman on television, right?
		Sidney-Ann.

	Frank nods.

			     FRANK
		I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think she's a Republican.

			     FRANK
		I can't help myself.

	Kathleen pats him.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		What about you?  Is there someone else?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.
		Somewhere --
			(she throws up her hands)
		In cyberspace.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's
	building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All
	Stock 40% off."

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY

	The store is crowded.  People are buying stacks of books.
	We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a
	customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's
	finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George
	saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though
	it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
	the last place on the earth.

	There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

	Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
	her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the
	sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My store is closing this week.
		I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?
		Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

	As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		This is a tragedy.
			(yelling across the shop to her
			 husband)
		Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the
		Swan.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		-- and in a week, it will be something
		really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I
		am being amazingly brave --

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		What are you going to do with yourself?

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I'm going to take some
		time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm
		almost looking forward to it --

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna
		throw up.

			     SECOND SHOPPER
		I came here every Saturday when I was a
		little girl.  I remember when your mother
		gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it
		with a box of Kleenex," that's what she
		told me.

			     THIRD SHOPPER
		She's looking down on you right now.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm sure she is.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I have promised myself I'm not going
		to cry.

	A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books
	up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
	counter.

			     FOURTH SHOPPER
		We should bomb Foxbooks.

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not their fault.  The truth is, the
		world is just... different.

	She starts ringing up the sale.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen walks home.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,
		someone, some foolish person will
		probably think it's a tribute to this
		city, the way it keeps changing on you,
		the way you can never count on it, or
		something.  I know, because that's the
		sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the
		truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if
		part of me has died,  and my mother has
		died all over again, and no one can ever
		make it right.

	She stops in front of the window, watching the customers
	lined up to buy books.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen enters and looks around.

	She goes up the stairs.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT

	As Kathleen walks into it.

	It's huge, of course.  With its reading area, and stage, and
	room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
	books and so many customers.

	Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
	wilted.

	KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.

	And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance.  She doesn't
	see him.

	A woman browsing, stops a sales person.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Do you have the "Shoe" books?

			     SALESPERSON
		The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		I don't know.  My friend told me my
		daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, 
		so here I am.

			     KATHLEEN
		Noel Streatfeild.  Noel Streatfeild wrote
		Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and
		Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...
			(she starts crying as she tells
			 her)
		I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my
		favorite, although Ballet Shoes is
		completely wonderful.

			     SALESPERSON
		Streatfeild.  How do you spell that?

			     KATHLEEN
		S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Thank you.

	As she walks away.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		They know nothing, they know absolutely
		nothing.

	ON JOE

	as he watches her.  We hear the sound of the computer.

	She starts out of the store.  And hold on him.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN

	A screen which says Reply and which now reads "I'm sorry."

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

			     JOE
		Asshole.

	He backspaces, deleting.  Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.
		Truly I don't.  And anything I do say
		will sound trite.  I hope you feel
		better.

	He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.

	EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's
	building.

			     PATRICIA (V.O.)
		What I was thinking was she'd probably
		make a great children's book either.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Why would you think that?

	They get out of the cab.

			     PATRICIA
		She knows everything.  She has flawless
		taste.  She's famous for it.
		The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes
		it, it sells.  Period.

	INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.

			     JOE
		So you're going to offer her a job?

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?  What else has she got to do?

			     JOE
		Now that she's destitute --

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

			     JOE
		Well, I can't imagine her working for
		you.

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?

			     JOE
		She has a horrible personality, she's...
		nice to everyone all the time.  It's
		exhausting.  And her staff turnover is
		... non-existent.  They've been there
		forever.  Until... recently, when they
		all found out they were going to lose
		their jobs.

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

	The elevator door is closing.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Hold the elevator!

	They get in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

			     JOE
		Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

			     PATRICIA
		Last time, we rode in an elevator, we
		made the deal of the century.  What is
		going to happen this time?

			     CHARLIE
		Miss Grant's going to get me a part in
		one of her movies, that's what's going
		to happen.

			     VERONICA
		In your dream, Charlie.

			     PATRICIA
			(back to the conversation with
			 Joe)
		I love how you've totally forgotten you
		had any role in her current situation.
		It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone
		... Who?  Who does it remind me of?
			(thinks for a moment)
		Me!

	The elevator suddenly stops.

			     PATRICIA
		Shit.

			     VERONICA
		Shit.

			     JOE
		It is stuck?

			     CHARLIE
		Could be.

	He pushes the open button.  Nothing.  Turns the key, hits the
	open button, flicks the emergency switch.  The he starts
	hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

			     JOE
		Charlie, what are you doing?

			     CHARLIE
		Bang the door.

			     PATRICIA
		Really.

	Joe bangs the door.  Nothing.

			     CHARLIE
		I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
		basement.

			     VERONICA
		Can it do that?

			     JOE
		No.

	He picks up the phone.

			     JOE
		This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.
		We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There
		are four of us --

			     PATRICIA
			(grabs the phone)
		-- and if you don't get your ass up here
		in two shakes and get us out --

	He hangs up.

			     JOE
			(to Veronica)
		Are you all right?

			     VERONICA
		It's hot.

	Joe hands her his handkerchief.

			     CHARLIE
		Everyone should jump in the air.

			     PATRICIA
		What?

			     CHARLIE
		We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one
		is here and it opens.

	Everyone stares at each other.

			     JOE
		One -- two -- three --

	They all jump into the air.

	They all land.

	Nothing happens.

	INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

	Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her
	nails.

	We hear the fire department banging outside...

			     VERONICA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to
		start speaking to my mother.  She slept
		with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's
		fault, I don't know, and then she sold
		the story to Inside Edition.
		That could have been Oscar's idea, too.
		Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder
		what she's doing right this minute.  I
		think of her... whenever I hear about a
		new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I
		just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

	She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

			     PATRICIA
		Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That
		would be so great for the book.

			     CHARLIE
			(trying to figure it out)
		If I ever get out of here...

			     PATRICIA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm having my
		eyes lasered.

			     CHARLIE
		I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I
		should marry her.  I don't know what's
		been stopping me.

	He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,
	shows it to Joe.

			     JOE
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

	He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her
	purse.

			     PATRICIA
		Where is my TicTacs?
			(looks at Joe)
		What?

	The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT

	Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat.  Joe
	is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.

	He boards his boat and goes below.  A light goes on.  We hear
	the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I came home tonight and got into the
		elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour
		later, I got out of the elevator and
		Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly
		everything had become clear.
			(continued)

	INT. BOAT - NIGHT

	A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where
	Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.

	Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		It's a long story.  Full of the personal
		details we avoid so carefully...

	Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow.  Brinkley
	jumps back onto the berth with Joe.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Kathleen is making tea.  She starts toward the bedroom.  We
	see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all
	of Frank's typewriters used to be.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I wonder whether change isn't a kind of
		infection.  You start with one thing --
		something you never ever thought would
		change and it does --
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		and the next thing you know even your bed
		is in a different place.
			(continued)

	Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has
	been rearranged.

	She gets into bed and turns on the television set.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	The bookshelves are empty.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		Six months ago, when you and I first met,
		I knew everything about myself -- what I
		would be doing for the rest of my life
		and even the person I would be doing it
		with.  Now I know nothing.

	On the door is a small sign.  "After 42 years, we are closing
	our doors.  We have loved being part of your lives."

	Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

	The little bell over the door jingles.

	Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
	it.

	Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

	Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
	for the last time.

	The grate starts to lower.

	Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks
	off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

	And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns
	into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

	And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
	screen.

	EXT. A BLUE SKY WITH A BIG COMPUTER SUN SHINING IN IT, AND PAN

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	George is now the head of the children department at the
	store and he is sitting in the children's section on an itty-
	bitty chair.  His staff is sitting on little itty-bitty
	chairs too.

			     GEORGE
		Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott
		revolutionized the publishing of

	Several are dozing.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE & 72ND - DAY

	Joe walks past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue.  He's with
	Annabel and Matt:

			     JOE
		What about going to the Children's Zoo?

			     ANNABEL
		I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

			     JOE
		Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

			     ANNABEL
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     MATT
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     JOE
		Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

	INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY

	Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
	Japanese soup and noodles.

			     JOE
		I'll read you a story.

			     ANNABEL
		Where did she go?

			     JOE
		She had to close her store.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		She didn't have enough business.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Well.  Her store was very close to our
		store, and you know our store sells books
		at a slightly lower cost --

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more
		people can buy books.

			     ANNABEL
		Why couldn't she sell that way too?

			     JOE
		Because she's small and we're big.  How
		about we go get some candy?

			     ANNABEL
		So now she's gone and it's all your
		fault.

			     JOE
		It's business, Annabel.  It's not
		personal.  How about we go get so much
		candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
		for days?

			     MATT
		What's personal?

			     ANNABEL
		Personal means that she's gone forever,
		and now we'll never get another book from
		her as long as we ever live.

	She burst into tears.  Matt bursts into tears too.

			     JOE
		Remember the man who worked with her?

			     ANNABEL
			(a wail)
		No.

			     JOE
		Well I hired him.

			     ANNABEL
		You killed the Storybook Lady.

	Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

	Annabel sobs hysterically.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	George is wearing the same pointed hat Kathleen wore as the
	Storybook Lady.  There's a sign that says: Storybook Person.

	Several children are listening.

	We see:

	ANNABEL

	She's glowering.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex.  She has a 
	terrible cold.  Her nose is red, her eyes are watery.  On the
	bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers, pills, etc.

	We hear the sound of computer keys clicking.

			      JOE (V.O.)
		Why haven't you written?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have a cold.

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

		My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She's drinking cranberry juice.  Joni Mitchell on the stereo.

	The sound of computer keys clicking again.

		    	      JOE (V.O.)
		Are you feeling any better?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I'm lying in bed listening to Joni
		Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice
		which I am sorry to say is the exact same

		going to do?

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Joe is walking Brinkley back to the boat.  A limousine has
	pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags.
	Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox.

			     JOE
		What are you doing here?

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - DUSK

	Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks.  Nelson
	lifts his glass in a toast.

			     NELSON
		To us.

			     JOE
		Father and son, together at last.  That
		happened with Gillian?

	Nelson ignores the question.

			     NELSON
		I've stayed here after, let's see, your
		mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --

			     JOE
		-- the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How
		ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

			     JOE
		-- also the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the
		astrologer.

			     JOE
		Whose moon turned out to be in somebody
		else's house, as I recall.

			     NELSON
		Just like Gillian.

			     JOE
		Gillian ran off with someone?

			     NELSON
		The nanny.

			     JOE
		Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with
		Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly
		ironic.

			     NELSON
		True true.

			     JOE
		There's no other word for it.

			     NELSON
		Who did you break up with?

			     JOE
		Patricia.  You met her.

			     NELSON
		Would I like her?
			(cracks himself up)
		Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have
		some peanuts.  Of course I have to live
		out of a suitcase for a least three
		weeks, and then there's the inevitable
		legal hassle, more of your inheritance
		down the drain.

			     JOE
		Don't worry about it.

			     NELSON
		I won't.  But then I get to meet someone
		new.  That's the easy part.

			     JOE
		Oh, right, a snap to find the one single
		person in the world who fills your heart
		with joy.

			     NELSON
		Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been
		with anyone who fits that description?
		Have you?

			     JOE
		On to the next.

			     NELSON
		Isn't it a beautiful night?

	Hold on Joe.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY

	Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a
	bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane.

	Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer.
	Sees Kelly, 3A.  He presses.  Nothing.  Presses again.

		Joe Fox.

		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		May I please come up?

			     KATHLEEN
		It's really not a good idea.

	Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.
	Joe follows.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

			     KATHLEEN
			(into the intercom)
		I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?
		I'm sniffling and not really awake --

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an

			     KATHLEEN
			(into intercom)
		-- and vitamin C, so I would really
		appreciate it if you would come some
		other time --

	There's a knock on the door right next to her.  Kathleen
	practically jumps out of her skin.  She looks through the
	peephole.  There he is.

			     JOE
		Kathleen?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just a second.

	She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
	scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door.  Joe is
	holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

			     JOE
		Hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I heard you were sick and I was worried
		and I wanted to --
			(he hears voices)
		Is someone here?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just the Home Shopping Network.

			     JOE
		Bought any porcelain dolls?

			     KATHLEEN
		I was thinking about it.
			(beat)
		You put me out of business --

			     JOE
		I know that --

			     KATHLEEN
		And now you turn up with flowers?  Did
		you come to gloat?

			     JOE
		No.

			     KATHLEEN
		To offer me a job --

			     JOE
		No, I wouldn't think of --

			     KATHLEEN
		Because I have plans, I have lots of
		offers.  I've been offered a job by --
		well, actually by --

			     JOE
		My former?

			     KATHLEEN
		Former?

			     JOE
		We broke up.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect
		for each other.
			(she claps her hand over her
			 mouth)
		I don't mean to say things like that.  No
		matter what you have done to me, there is
		no excuse for my saying anything like
		that.  But every time I see you --

			     JOE
		Things like that just seem to fly out of
		your mouth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.
			(sharply)
		Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.
			(she says it again, a little
			 more nicely)
		Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

	She starts to the door.

			     JOE
		I bought you flowers.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.
			(trying as hard as she can)
		Thank you.

	She takes them.

	He takes them back.

			     JOE
		Why don't I put them in water?

	He heads for the kitchen.  A beat, while she stares after him.
	Then follows.

	INT. KITCHEN - DAY

	When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle
	for water.  Turns on the stove.

			     JOE
		You're sick.  Sit down, please.

	He pulls out a kitchen chair.  Kathleen sits.  She's a little
	woozy.

			     JOE
		Vase?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper left.

	He gets out a vase.  Fills it with water.

			     JOE
		George says hello.  He told me you
		weren't feeling well.

			     KATHLEEN
		How is George?

			     JOE
		Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.
		No one is allowed to work in his
		department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in
		children's literature.

	He unwraps the paper around the flowers.  Daisies.  Puts them
	in a vase.

			     KATHLEEN
		I love daisies.

			     JOE
		You told me.

	He puts the vase on the kitchen table.  Kathleen plays with
	the petals.

			     KATHLEEN
		They're so friendly.  Don't you think
		they are the friendliest flower?

			     JOE
		I do.

			     KATHLEEN
		When did you break up?

			     JOE
		Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

			     KATHLEEN
		Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This
		other person I know broke up with someone
		in an elevator.  I think it was in an
		elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after
		it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly
		everything became clear.  When I saw you,
		at the coffee place, I was waiting for him
		and I was --

			     JOE
		-- charming.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was not charming.

			     JOE
		Well, you looked charming.

	The teakettle whistles.  Joe turns off the burner.

			     JOE
		Tea?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper right.

	He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was upset.  And I was horrible.

			     JOE
		Honey?

	Kathleen nods.  He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

			     JOE
		I was horrible.

			     KATHLEEN
		True.  But I have no excuse.

	She picks up the daisies and carries them into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Joe follows her.  They both sit.

			     JOE
		Whereas I am a horrible person and have
		no choice but to be horrible, is that
		what you're saying?

			     KATHLEEN
		No I am not saying that because I am done
		saying horrible things, even to you.

			     JOE
		You did it again.

	She claps her hand over her mouth.

			     JOE
		I put you out of business.  You're
		entitled to hate me.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't hate you --

			     JOE
		But you'll never forgive me.  Like
		Elizabeth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     JOE
		Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.
		She was too proud --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

			     JOE
		-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.
		Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.
			(beat)
		It wasn't personal --

			     KATHLEEN
		-- It was business.  What is that
		supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.
		All it means is it's not personal to you,
		but it's personal to me, it's personal to
		a lot of people.
			(she shrugs helplessly)
		What's wrong with personal anyway?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, whatever else anything is, it
		ought to begin by being personal.

	Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

			     KATHLEEN
		My head's starting to get funny.  I have
		to go back to bed.

	They walk to...

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
	She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
	herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why did you stop by?  I forget.

			     JOE
		I wanted to be your friend.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.

			     JOE
		I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I
		say?  Sometimes a person just wants the
		impossible.  Could I ask you something?

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		What happened with that guy at the cafe?

			     KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

			     JOE
		But you're crazy about him --

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I am.

			     JOE
		Then why don't you run off with him?
		What are you waiting for?

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't actually know him.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KATHLEEN
		We only know each other -- oh God, you're
		not going to believe this --

			     JOE
		Let me guess.  From the Internet.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		You've Got Mail.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Very powerful words.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

	Joe sits on the edge of the bed.

			     JOE
		I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I
		make a little suggestion?  I think you
		should meet him.  No.  I take it back.
		Why meet him?

			     KATHLEEN
			(starting to get sharp again)
		I hardly think I need advice from someone
		who --

	He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  And
	holds it there.  It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

			     JOE
		I concede I bring out the worst in you,
		but let me help you not to say something
		you'll just torture yourself about for
		years to come.

	She starts to smile and he removes his hand.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		I hope you're better soon.  It would be 
		a shame to miss New York in the spring.

	Joe stands.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you for the daisies.

	He starts for the door.

			     JOE
		Take care.

			     KATHLEEN
		I will.

			     JOE
		Goodbye.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye.

	We hear the door close.

	Hold on Kathleen.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Christina is running.  She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER
	coming toward her.  She has no hope that he will notice her,
	and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

			     MALE RUNNER
		Hi.

			     CHRISTINA
		Hi.

	He passes her.  Christina can't believe it.

	She does a little dance of joy.

	Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
	beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

	Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.

	INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING

	Patricia comes in.

	The place is packed.  There are hundreds of young Jewish New
	Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  The Rabbi
	is dancing among them.

	Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

	The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

			     RABBIT
		Shabbat shalom!

	He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
	whirling off together.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen at the computer, typing.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about this and
		I think we should meet.

	She clicks the send button and then exits from American On
	Line.

	On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
	several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.

	She clicks Word.

	She goes to File: New.

	There are several choices of format.

	She stares at the choices.  Then she clicks Book format.

	A blank page appears in the computer.

	She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little
	girl named..."

	She pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  She sees
	the flowers that Joe brought her.

	And then she types: "Daisy."

	As she goes on typing...

	INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT

	On Joe typing.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		We should meet.  And we will meet.  But
		I'm in the middle of a project that
		needs...
			(he pauses to think of the
			 right word)
		... tweaking.

	A look of calculation on his face.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of
	coffee.

	And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks.  He waves at her,
	pretending surprise at seeing her.  Has he been watching the
	store and waiting for her to come in?  We'll never know.

	INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.

			     JOE
		Tweaking?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's what he said.

			     JOE
		He's probably married.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not
		possible.

			     JOE
		Have you asked him if he's married?  Have
		you said, "Are you married?"

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

	Joe looks at her, shrugs.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she types:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know this is probably a little late to
		be asking, but are you married?

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	As he answers:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Am I married?  What kind of a question is
		that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't
		you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.
		Your friends are telling you the reason
		we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I
		right?

	INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY

	Kathleen and Joe having nachos.

			     JOE
		So he didn't exactly answer.

			     KATHLEEN
		He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew
		exactly what I was up to.  Which is just
		like him.

			     JOE
		But he didn't exactly answer, did he?
		Did he?

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		Maybe he's fat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't care about that.

			     JOE
		You don't care that he might be one of
		those guys who's so fat he has to be
		removed from his house with a crane?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's very unlikely.

			     JOE
		Why else do you think he's putting off
		meeting you?  Although... maybe that's
		not it.  Maybe...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		Never mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		What????

			     JOE
		He could be waiting til he's paroled.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you won't believe this, there was a
		moment when George thought he might be
		the rooftop killer, which was completely
		ridiculous --

	Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
	true.

			     JOE
		What's his handle?

	She shakes her head.

			     JOE
		Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is
		that what you think?

			     KATHLEEN
		NY 152.

			     JOE
		One five two.  One hundred fifty two.
		Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.
		He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
		He's had 152 moles removed and now he
		has 152 pockmarks.

	EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER

	As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.

			     JOE
		His combined college board scores.

			     KATHLEEN
		His IQ.

			     JOE
		The number of women he's slept with.

			     KATHLEEN
		The number of times he's seen The
		Godfather.

			     JOE
		That's the first good thing I've heard
		about him.

			     KATHLEEN
		His address.  No, no, no.  He would never
		do anything that prosaic.

	On Joe, looking a little wounded.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The only thing I really care about
		besides the married thing... and the
		jail thing... is the boat thing.

			     JOE
		The boat thing?

			     KATHLEEN
		I could never be with anyone who has
		a boat.

			     JOE
		Oh.

			     KATHLEEN
		So that clinches it.  We'll never be
		together.  I'll take care of these.

	He picks up a mango, squeezes it.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I could never be with anyone who likes
		Joni Mitchell.
			(singing, imitating Joni)
		"It's cloud's illusions I recall, I
		really don't know clouds at all."  
		What does that mean?

	Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.

	But Kathleen doesn't say anything.

	She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some
	she wants.

			     JOE
		How's your book coming?

	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

	As they walk away from the market, going uptown.

			     KATHLEEN
		There's a children's book editor I know,
		from the store, and she's excited to 
		read it.  When I finish it.  Who would 
		ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,
		if I didn't have all this free time, I
		would never have discovered --

	She stops, realizing what she's saying.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The truth is, he was the one who made me
		start thinking about writing --

			     JOE
		Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

			     KATHLEEN
		Mister 152... insights into my soul.

			     JOE
		Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope
		your mango's ripe.

			     JOE
		I think it is.  Want to bump into me
		Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

	EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	As Joe types.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		How about meeting Saturday?  The first
		day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place
		in Riverside Park at 88th Street where
		the path curves and when you come around
		the curve, you'll find me waiting.

	INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

	Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.

			     JOE
		Today?

			     KATHLEEN
		Today.

			     JOE
		Whoa.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.  In Riverside Park.

			     JOE
		Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,
		and I don't even know it.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
	papaya drinks.

			     JOE
		He could be the Zipper Man.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who's that?

			     JOE
		This guy on Amsterdam who repairs
		zippers.  You'll never have to buy new
		luggage.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop teasing.

			     JOE
		Timing is everything.  He waited until
		you were primed.  Until you knew there
		was no other man you could ever love.

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost believe it)
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Sometimes I wonder...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

	They stop walking, they look at each other.

			     JOE
		If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't
		been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd
		just met --

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't.

			     JOE
		I would have asked for your phone number
		and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24
		hours before calling and asking, "How
		about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
		for as long as we both shall live?"

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost a swoon)
		Joe...

			     JOE
		And then we would never have been at war.

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		The only fight we'd ever have is what
		video to rent on Saturday night.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who fights about that?

			     JOE
		Some people.  Not us.

			     KATHLEEN
		We would never.

	A long beat.

			     JOE
		If only...

			     KATHLEEN
		Please.  I have to go.

	She doesn't move.

			     JOE
		Let me ask you something?  How come
		you'll forgive him for standing you
		up and you won't forgive me for a 
		little tiny thing like putting you
		out of business?

	Kathleen looks at him.  Shakes her head.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		Oh how I wish you would.

	It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.

	It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		I really do have to go.

			     JOE
		You don't want to be late.

	She's in agony.

	He turns and walks away.

	After a moment, she does too.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her
	house.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her
	clothes.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON

	As she comes toward the entrance to the park.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.

	She comes to a stop.

	Looks around.

	A young woman in running clothes passes by.

	A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
	runners use to push babies in.

	Kathleen looks at her watch.

	Suddenly she hears a noise.  A dog barking.

	And Brinkley comes around the corner.

			     VOICE
		Brinkley!  Brinkley!

	And hold on Kathleen as she sees.

	JOE

	And she starts to cry.

	And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.

			     JOE
		Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

			     KATHLEEN
		I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to
		be you so badly.

	And as they kiss, we hold on them.

	And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
	park on a beautiful spring day.

	A dog is leaping around them.

	And as we get further and further away from them, the screen
	turns into

	CYBERSPACE

	And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

	And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

	and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
	clicking

                                                       July 13, 2007
          

          
          OVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS. Moist
          FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment. Someone is beating off.
          A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine.
          The beating off resumes at a quickened pace. The SQUEAKING of
          bed springs joins in.
          Another page is turned. Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE
          lets out a quiet MOAN.
          The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a
          relieved sigh of finality.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My name... is Nick.

          NICK TWISP, 16, stares up at the ceiling. He's glassy eyed
          from the exertion...

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          ...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well
          thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My last name, which I loath, is
                    Twisp.

          Nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. He pulls
          the drawer under his mattress out.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The next thing you should know
                    about me is that I am obsessed with
                    sex.

          A view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly
          filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most
          recently utilized magazine in its place.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Lately, I have become morbidly
                    aware of my penis.

          Nick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles
          again. He looks at himself from various angles.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Once a remote region accessed
                    indifferently for micturition, it
                    has developed overnight into a
                    gaudy Las Vegas of the body.

          We PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there
          is a hole in the screen leading us to...

          

                                                                     2.

          

          LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
          The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS.
          We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show.
          Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD
          leaps through a burning HOOP on stage.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nick typing on an obsolete PC.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am entering the tenth grade at
                    St. Vitus Academy, which, I am
                    told, is the most rigorous prep
                    school in the East Bay. Hopefully I
                    will be invited to join Miss
                    Satron's English Literature class.

          A view of the books and CDs on his shelf.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am a voracious reader and listen
                    to Frank Sinatra. So needless to
                    say, I am still a virgin.

          Follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words -

          STILL A VIRGIN.
          He pauses in thought, then continues.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have yet to hold hands with a
                    girl, let alone have my winkie up
                    her wendell.

          INT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - DAY

          WE MOVE down an airplane aisle, past PASSENGERS sleeping and
          chatting.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am an only child except for my
                    big sister Joanie, who has left the
                    bosom of her family to sling hash
                    at 35,000 feet.

          We reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty-
          something, JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Liver frying in a pan. ESTELLE TWISP, 43, cooks and puffs on
          a cigarette at the same time.

          

                                                                      3.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom gives driver's tests at the
                    Department of Motor Vehicles.
          Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper. He watches
          with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    She used to keep Dad up to date on
                    all the motor statutes he was
                    violating. This is one of the
                    reasons they got divorced.
          JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN
          OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic,
          but he is completely devoid of an ass.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long
                    distance trucker, though his
                    ultimate ambition is to be on state
                    disability.
          Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the
          breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in
          Nick's hands.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I've been struggling to think of a
                    commendable thing to say about
                    Jerry.
          Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    No luck. His grey matter registers

          EXT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - DAY

          GEORGE TWISP, 41, scruffy and greying, waters the foliage
          outside the house with a high powered hose.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Dad is a copywriter for
                    agricultural magazines.
          In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims
          of his dad's BMW 325i.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    He'd like to own a more prestigious
                    model of BMW, but, as he often
                    reminds me, he is burdened with
                    crippling child support payments.

          

                                                                     4.

          
          Nick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive
          toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings
          than the coastline of Albania.
          She continues past him and embraces George.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She
                       is twenty and a recently minted
                       alumna of Stanfort.
          Super:          (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology)
          George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his
          attention back to the Beamer.
          As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on
          the hose slackens.
          Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          We're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks
          down at the tent in his boxers.

                                                      CUT TO:
          He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection.

          NICK'S POV
          of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His
          eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       My mother is the one who painted my
                       room to look like Dolly Parton's
                       boudoir. She read this color was
                       used in hospitals to calm mental
                       patients.
          Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       I'll tell you what I told her. I am
                       not mentally ill.
          BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then
          the long moan and sigh of relief.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       I'm just a teenager.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There
          is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios.
          Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls
          with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle
          is washing dishes when she spies something out the window.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry? Where did that car come
                    from?
          Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to
          appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive.

                              JERRY
                    It's a '62 Lincoln convertible.
                    Like the one Kennedy was shot in.

                              NICK
                    Except his was black and yours is
                    white. And dirty.

                              JERRY
                    See that. I was going to take you
                    and your mom for a spin after
                    breakfast. But now I guess it'll
                    just be her and me. You have your
                    smart mouth to thank for that.

                              NICK
                    Damn it. I guess I'll just have to
                    hang out all alone at the book
                    depository.

                                JERRY
                    The what?

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry, I don't understand. What
                    happened to the Chevy-Nova?

                              JERRY
                    Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda
                    Naval Air Base. A man should never
                    own a car for more than three
                    months, Estelle. That way he always
                    gets the thrill of owning a new
                    automobile!
          Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and
          disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner
          savvy.

          

                                                                     6.

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for
          Jerry to open the passenger door for her.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    After spending twelve years with
                    Dad, Mom has had a string of
                    lovers, none of whom she has asked
                    me to approve.
          Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs
          in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed
          before opening the door herself.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I'm starting to think her
                    boyfriends are like U.S.
                    Presidents.
          As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the
          direction of the trash can at the end of the drive.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Just when you think they can't get
                    any worse...
          He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry
          drives off anyway.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...she manages to find God's
                    Perfect Asshole.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY


          ON A TV SCREEN
          Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX
          DOCUMENTARY he recorded.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the
          jingle jangle of a belt buckle.
          Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell.
          The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second
          time, the orgy gets muted.
          Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers.

          I/E. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS
          standing on the stoop.

          

                                                                      7.

          
          Their eyes drift to Nick's mid-section.
          Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to
          fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he
          wrangles the belt.

                              SAILOR #1
                    Is Jerry here?

                              NICK
                    He just left. What's up?

                              SAILOR #1
                    What's up is that hunk of shit
                    Chevy he sold us made it seventeen
                    miles before the engine blew up.

                              SAILOR #2
                    And we found evidence of a banana
                    in the transmission.
          The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a
          plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking
          Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job.
          A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open
          garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can.
          Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.

                              SAILOR #1
                    So he owes us nine hundred dollars.

                              NICK
                    Well, I think he used that nine
                    hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln.
                    He's giving my mom a joyride in it
                    now. But he'll be back this
                    afternoon, so I would come back
                    then. He's pretty stubborn. You
                    might have to beat it out of him.

                              SAILOR #1
                    That can be arranged. In the
                    meantime we're leaving the piece of
                    shit in the driveway. With a note.
          Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor
          finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.

                               NICK
                    I like it. Very to the point.
                    Well... See you guys this
                    afternoon!
          The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor.
          As they turn to go and Nick closes the door...

          

                                                                   8.

          

          

          

          

                              LEFTY (V.O.)
                    I might have to kill myself.

          EXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY

          In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN
          GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I hope you have a good reason.
          Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass
          overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple
          with a pair of binoculars.

                              LEFTY
                    My sister said she saw Millie
                    Filbert holding hands with some
                    college guy.

                              NICK
                    I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister
                    is just waging psychological
                    warfare.

                              LEFTY
                    Well it's working. What am I gonna
                    do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think
                    about Millie so much my balls ache.

                              NICK
                    Maybe your just not wacking off
                    enough.
          As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick
          and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants.
          As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance...

          THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
          The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    So, I've been taping my pecker to
                    my right leg at night.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    In case you haven't heard, Lefty's
                    erect member takes a dramatic turn
                    midway up the shaft.

          

                                                                   9.

          

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Then I look at this issue of Better
                    Homes and Gardens that has a girl
                    that looks just like Millie until
                    it gets good and hard. I think it's
                    starting to straighten out.

                              NICK
                    Why don't you just have your
                    parents take you to the dick
                    doctor?

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Are you kidding? It would kill them
                    to know that I even get hard-ons.

                              NICK
                    Still, you might want to get it
                    fixed before asking Millie out.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    True. What if I shove it up the
                    wrong hole?
          Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy
                    is somewhat tenuous; he imagines
                    there are orifices galore down
                    there.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY


                              JERRY
                    Nick, you little shit, get down
                    here!
          Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the
          window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, do you know anything about
                    this?
          She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and
          the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood.

                              NICK
                    Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.
                    They want their money back. I guess
                    there was a banana in the
                    transmission.

                              JERRY
                    You tell them when I was coming
                    back?

          

                                                                  10.

          

                              NICK
                    Now why would I do that?
          Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence.

                              ESTELLE
                    What are you going to do, Jerry?

                              JERRY
                    I think I'll go get the Lincoln
                    washed.

                              ESTELLE
                    You're leaving? What happens when
                    the sailor comes back for his nine-
                    hundred dollars?

                              JERRY
                    Just tell him he bought the car
                    with my standard guarantee. Thirty
                    days or thirty feet. Whichever
                    comes first. I'm in the right.
          And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the
          simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door.
          They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front
          steps.

                              NICK
                    Oh, look. The sailors are here.
          Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another,
          searching for a hiding space as he hisses.

                              JERRY
                    Get rid of them!
          And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors
          pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for
          the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in.
          Jerry bolts up the stairs.

                              NICK
                    Jerry, where are you going? Just
                    tell them you are in the right.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

          They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the
          stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a
          sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the
          cornfield.
          The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground
          while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets.

          

                                                                     11.

          

                              SAILOR #1
                    Sixty-three lousy dollars.

                              JERRY
                    That's my life savings!
          One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he
          whimpers.

                              ESTELLE
                    Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!

                              SAILOR #1
                    Touch that phone, kid, and you lose
                    your left nut.
          Nick raises his hands. "You don't have to tell me twice."

                              JERRY
                    Please. Please don't hurt me. It's
                    all I got, guys. I swear. Take the
                    Lincoln!

                              SAILOR #1
                    I don't want the Lincoln. I want my
                    nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking
                    the sixty-three, which means you
                    owe me another eight hundred and
                    thirty.

                              NICK
                    Eight hundred and thirty seven,
                    actually.

                              SAILOR #1
                    Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or
                    you'll be found in the trunk of
                    your new used piece of shit at the
                    bottom of the Bay.
          And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the
          floor like an abandoned marionette.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that
          reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. The moment they pull out, Jerry
          dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.

                              JERRY
                    Wow, those guys are even dumber
                    than I thought. They actually think
                    I'm stupid enough to let them
                    muscle me into paying.

          

                                                                  12.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry, what are you talking about?
                    We need to call the police!

                              JERRY
                    I'm not some tattle-tale like your
                    son.
          Nick rolls his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    Then for God's sake, Jerry, just
                    sell the Lincoln and pay them!

                              JERRY
                    Can't. It's in The Code.

                              ESTELLE
                    What code? The vehicular code?

                              JERRY
                    Code of the streets, Babe. Code of
                    the streets.

                              ESTELLE
                    Then what are you planning to do?
          Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The
          Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await
          his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation.

          I/E. LINCOLN - DAY

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    We are going to Ukiah for a last
                    minute vacation.
          Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans. He's behind
          the wheel of his Lincoln convertible.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Jerry says we'll be staying in a
                    cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by
                    a friend of his.
          Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. Her
          halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City. Nick's
          in the back. Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss
          Corn Dog of 1954.

                              ESTELLE
                    Goodbye, everyone! We're going on
                    vacation!

                              JERRY
                    Let's blow!

          

                                                                  13.

          
          She hops up front with Jerry. He fires up the Lincoln and the
          radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I'm not sure how this is the
                    solution to his problem. But I've
                    decided to go along with it, seeing
                    as I'm not rooting for him anyway.
          As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage
          can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and
          shatters on the street behind them.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist
          covered hills of Ukiah.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          They've pulled to a stop. Estelle stares in horror.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry...? You said it was a cabin.
          In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long,
          green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass.
          A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit
          picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN.
          Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm
          around her.

                              JERRY
                    C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on
                    the inside.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Substitute cluttered for cute. The three of them are crammed
          around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray
          table. 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them.

                              JERRY
                    I say the kid does the dishes and
                    we retire to the master bedroom.
          Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches
          him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically.

                              NICK
                    Mom? Do you really like Jerry?
          Her smile fades.

          

                                                                   14.

          

                                ESTELLE
                    Nick, how   many men do you think
                    there are   who'd be interested in a
                    forty-one   year old woman with two
                    brats, no   money, and stretch marks?
          And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom is a realist about everything.
                    Except her age. She's forty-three.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

          Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink. The trailer
          shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          An old crone, MRS. SAUNDERS, makes her way up the walk. She
          gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the
          banging, his hair going in all directions.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
                    It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders.
                    Church services begin at seven
                    fifteen prompt. Donuts will be
                    served.
          Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers.
          Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen
          door and takes off.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in
          one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded
          path.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well-
          attended congregation in the meeting hall.
          WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the
          path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy
          overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop.
          A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the
          blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands
          facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in
          her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just
          enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath.

          

                                                                     15.

          
          Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor
          like something out of a François Boucher painting.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       The moment I see her I know the
                       Gods, while having cruelly endowed
                       me with imperfect posture and pussy
                       postponing pimples, had put me here
                       for a purpose. My heart palpitates.
                       My mind races. I get an instant

                       T.E.
          Super:                (Thundering Erection)
          Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder
          at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost
          flirtatious. Nick grins back.

                                 SHEENI
                       Your robe is open.
          Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes
          into a flustered march down the path.

          INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

          An austere   cement shed with three dripping shower heads and
          no privacy   walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry
          appears in   the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to
          the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on.
          Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing
          himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts
          warbling rock lyrics.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence.
          Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps.

                                 SHEENI
                       Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.

                                 ESTELLE
                       Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.

                                  NICK
                       Hello.

                                 ESTELLE
                       Sheeni needs to go to the grocery
                       store. I've offered her your help
                       in carrying her bags.
          Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk.

          

                                                                  16.

          

                              NICK
                    Thanks a pantsful.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          A dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He
          watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out
          to be kissed.

                              NICK
                    You don't have to go to services?

                              SHEENI
                    No. Much to the consternation of my
                    fanatical parents I have converted
                    to atheism. Fortunately my brother,
                    Paul, paved the way for such
                    transgressions.

                              NICK
                    Paul is an atheist too?

                              SHEENI
                    Buddhist, I believe, though we have
                    not seen him in some time. I myself
                    am looking forward to being free of
                    parental bondage.

                                NICK
                    Likewise.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, your mother seems very nice,
                    though your father I think might be
                    rather dim.

                              NICK
                    Jerry and I share no blood links of
                    any kind.
          As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in
          chorus.

                              NICK
                    Sounds rather zealous.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, even though I am no longer a
                    believer I always found the
                    services wonderfully aerobic.

                              NICK
                    You could say the same thing about
                    sex.
          Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently.

          

                                                                    17.

          

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, are you going to turn out
                    like all the other young men and
                    have nothing on your mind except
                    carnal pleasures?

                              NICK
                    I hardly ever think about sex.

                              SHEENI
                    Really? I think about it all the
                    time. It's the hormones at work,
                    you know.
          She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home.

                              NICK
                    Wow. A second floor.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. Father bought it so that he
                    could look down upon the world. For
                    him, Christian humility has always
                    been a struggle.
          Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, it was nice to meet you,
                    Nick.
          She trudges down the slate path to the home.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? Do you want to come to the
                    beach with me?
          She turns around. Gives a little smirk.

                              SHEENI
                    What a thoughtful invitation. I'd
                    love to, Nick. Wait for me in the
                    living room.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          A lot more space than My Green Haven. Dark paneling and
          somewhat more tasteful religious art.

                              SHEENI
                    Back in a moment.

          

                                                                  18.

          
          Nick watches her bound up the stairs.
          He wanders into the musty living area. Moves down the mantel
          examining the trinkets. Stops to regard the reproduction of
          Massaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall.
          He scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of
          Adam and Eve.

                              MR. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
                    I understand you have invited my
                    daughter to the beach.
          Nick spins around to see MR. SAUNDERS reclining in his
          armchair. He is an immense, florid-faced, verdant eye-browed
          ogre in a rumpled blue suit.

                              NICK
                    Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are
                    aware that in doing so you have
                    entered into an oral contract to
                    perform in loco parentis, i.e. to
                    provide for the safety and well-
                    being of aforementioned minor
                    female.

                              SHEENI (O.S.)
                    Oh, Father, do shut up.
          Sheeni descends the stairs. Jean cut-offs over a knockout
          yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility.
          Mr. Saunders grumbles. Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and
          pushes Nick out the door.

                              SHEENI
                    Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Vaya con Dios!

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket,
          reading their respective books. Nick watches her turning
          pages and making notes in the margins. She hands him her
          tanning lotion.

                              SHEENI
                    Would you mind applying this to my
                    exposed areas?

                              NICK
                    Not at all.

          

                                                                  19.

          
          She rolls over onto her stomach, exposing her exquisite back.
          Nick straddles her, hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils
          into her tanned flesh.
          Flashing super:          Thundering Erection

                              SHEENI
                    My, you get turned on easily.
          Nick's hands freeze.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have
                    our hormones to deal with. Girls
                    are fortunate in that it doesn't
                    show. For all the world knows, my
                    vagina could be moist with desire
                    as we speak.

                                 NICK
                    Is it?

                              SHEENI
                    That's none of your business, I'm
                    sure. Shall you do my front too?

                              NICK
                    I'm up for it.
          She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up
          against the yellow spandex.

                              SHEENI
                    I hope you don't find it too
                    stimulating, Nick.

                              NICK
                    I'm coping.
          He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the
          way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex.
          With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split.
          Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the
          softly yielding vee.

                              SHEENI
                    Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the
                    top now.
          Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He
          smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills.

                              SHEENI
                    Thanks, Nick.

          

                                                                  20.

          
          She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back
          to her book. Nick hovers above her a moment, then painfully
          returns to his own reading.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          They make their way down the path. Nick totes the beach bag.

                              SHEENI
                    Breathless is one of my favorite
                    films, though it might be eclipsed
                    by Rebel Without a Cause. I often
                    wonder what American cinema would
                    be like today had Dean done more
                    than three.
          Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence. He glances
          down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But
                    in fairness, I should tell you that
                    I have a boyfriend.
          Nick becomes sickeningly pale.

                              NICK
                    What's his name?

                              SHEENI
                    Trent Preston.

                              NICK
                    What's he like?

                              SHEENI
                    Seventeen years of age, six-two,
                    fluent in French, plays the piano,
                    a champion swimmer, and writes
                    Futurist Percussive poetry.
          They stop at the gate to the Saunders' home.

                              NICK
                    I'm not familiar with Futurist
                    Percussive poems.

                              SHEENI
                    I could recite one of Trent's if
                    you'd like.

                                 NICK
                    Please do.
          She takes a dramatic pause.

          

                                                                   21.

                    Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void.
          She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    If that's poetry, I'm a turkey
                    scrotum.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          TIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed. During this
          montage there is the constant ticking of a clock.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Here is an hour by hour account of
                    the worst night of my life.
          Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    1 AM. I decide it is just a case of
                    puppy love and look forward to the
                    interesting women I shall meet in
                    the future.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          A light comes on in the window.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick at the dining table, writing a note.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    2 AM. I conclude the only way out
                    is suicide. I begin to pen a
                    poignant suicide note. Sheeni will
                    see Trent for the shallow pedant he
                    is and always treasure my memory.

                              JERRY (O.S.)
                    Turn off the damn light!

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Nick paces about back and forth in the yard.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for
                    any of the manly, violent means of
                    suicide. I shall swallow sleeping
                    pills. Where to get them, though?

          

                                                                  22.

          

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Nick is in bed jerking off. The trailer shakes despite his
          best efforts.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    4 AM. I can not die an inviolate
                    virgin. Either I find a way to get
                    laid soon or suicide gets postponed
                    until after high school.

                              JERRY (O.S.)
                    You wanna beat your meat, go

          Nick in the shower going to town on his T.E.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    5 AM. It will be too painful to see
                    Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we
                    can cut our vacation short and
                    return to Oakland.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a
          manic insomniac.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see
                    Sheeni again!

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an
          I'M SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt, and tennis shoes. Sheeni
          stands in the door. Sleep-fogged eyes.

                              NICK
                    Good morning!

                              SHEENI
                    Nick? God what time is it?

                              NICK
                    Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?

                              SHEENI
                        (smiling with endearment)
                    Come back in two hours. I'm going
                    on a hike. You can join me if you'd
                    like.
          She closes the door.

          

                                                                     23.

          
          Super:     One hour fifty seven minutes later
          A knock on the door. Sheeni opens it to reveal... Nick,
          dressed the same. Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna
          neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat. She looks like the
          world's most desirable Girl Scout. She examines Nick's
          attire.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, where are your hiking boots,
                    water bottle, provisions, survey
                    maps and compass?

                              NICK
                    Like John Muir I enter the
                    wilderness with nothing more than
                    my journal and a childlike sense of
                    wonder.

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, but I have no plans to baby
                    any slackers.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Sheeni leads the way up hill. Nick clutches his cramped
          stomach with one hand, his journal in the other.
          He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her
          hiking shorts.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          Nick and Sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff. The waters
          of Clear Lake churn below.

                              NICK
                    Quite a drop.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. Not to be morbid, but this
                    sight has been the chosen means of
                    at least three teen suicides.

                              NICK
                    Huh. Quite a hike just to end your
                    life.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, there is a road. But I agree.
                    Adolescents have a tendency toward
                    the over-dramatic.
          Sheeni backs away. Nick stays, staring over the edge.

          

                                                                    24.

          

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Nick's eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree.
          He shakes off the last of it and zips up.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - LATER

          He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his
          journal. She looks up at his and smiles. The brazen sneak
          isn't even embarrassed.

                              NICK
                    That's my journal!

                              SHEENI
                    Don't get so upset Nick. Though
                    your handwriting is egregious, you
                    have a fairly decent vocabulary.
                    Although, Trent is not an "affected
                    twit."
          Nick snatches the journal out of her hands.

                              NICK
                    Those are my private thoughts and
                    are none of your business!

                              SHEENI
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    What?

                              SHEENI
                    The lengths you say you are willing
                    to go to to win my heart, the
                    contemplation of suicide at the
                    thought of not having me...
                        (taking a sensual breath)
                    It all evokes a strong emotional
                    warmth in my breast.
          Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if
          posing for a centerfold.

                              SHEENI
                    Did you mean it, Nickie?
          A beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he
          manages to gain his senses.

                              NICK
                    How would you like it if I read
                    your journal?

                              SHEENI
                    You can read it if you'd like.

          

                                                                     25.

          
          She hands it over. Nick squints at the writing.

                              NICK
                    It's in French.

                              SHEENI
                    A necessity for a child in a
                    household with prying Christian
                    parents.

                              NICK
                    What does it say?

                              SHEENI
                    Wouldn't you like to know. That
                    last passage would be of particular
                    interest to you.
          Nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists. She
          squeals and giggles.

                              NICK
                    Spill it! I demand full disclosure!

                              SHEENI
                    Never!
          They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together.
          Flashing super:        Thundering Erection
          They pause. He's got her arms pinned. She's on her back. He
          hovers above her.

                              SHEENI
                        (softly chanting)
                    Nickie's got a hard-on.
          Nick considers her expression.

                              SHEENI
                    You're still a virgin, I can tell.
                    Maybe that's why I like you.
          A beat. She looks at him expectantly. Nick is at a loss.

                              SHEENI
                    Kiss me, you wienie.
          Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth. Their noses
          dodge successfully and their lips meet.
          After a long moment, they break it off. Staring into each
          other's eyes. Sheeni jumps up.

          

                                                                     26.

          

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's
                    go!
          Nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick walks Sheeni to the gate. She turns around to face him.

                              NICK
                    When can I see you again?

                              SHEENI
                    Get up early tomorrow and you can
                    shower with me in the ladies room.
                    Five minutes to six. If you dare.
          Nick grins with excitement.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Nick dines at the tray table with Jerry and Estelle.

                              ESTELLE
                    So what's this Sheeni girl like?

                              NICK
                    She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.

                              JERRY
                    She's got a nice rack.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry!
          Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to
          murder the trucker in his sleep.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

          Nick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the
          anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT/DAY

          Another perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering
          in the blue morning sky. Nick emerges from My Green Haven in
          his robe. He starts off down the path.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the
          distant sound of dogs barking.

          

                                                                     27.

          

          EXT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

          Nick approaches the shower building. As he nears, the sound
          of water running can be heard from the ladies' side.

          INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM (WOMEN'S SIDE) - DAY

          The women's side has real stalls and privacy doors. Nick
          spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form
          showers, obscured by tacky stained glass.
          He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook.
          He approaches the stall.
          Flashing super:       Thundering Erection
          He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray.
          He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of
          white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs.
          Saunders! She looks up startled.
          Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders
          starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered.
          She hurls a bar of soap.
          The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing
          on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with
          him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS

                    RAPE! RAAAAAPE!
          Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches
          out and pulls Nick up.

                              SHEENI
                    Get out quick!
          Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her
          mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats.

          INT. CAFE - DAY

          Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as
          he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and
          looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him
          at the table.

                              NICK
                    Should I go to the sheriff's now?

                              SHEENI
                    No. I managed to convince Mother
                    you were retarded and couldn't read
                    the sign.

          

                                                                     28.

          
          Nick nods thankfully.

                              NICK
                    Say, where were you anyway?   We
                    said five minutes to six.

                              SHEENI
                    I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are
                    always discreetly late. It's
                    expected of us.

                              NICK
                    Swell. And the punctual guy fries
                    in the chair for rape.

                              SHEENI
                    Don't complain. At least you got to
                    shower with a naked woman.
                        (licking donut powder off
                         her fingers)
                    What are your plans today?

                              NICK
                    My parents want to go to
                    Middletown. Jerry has the moronic
                    notion of buying a trailer there
                    before we leave.

                              SHEENI
                    I should like to come with you,
                    Nick. The more time we spend
                    together the better. I fear when
                    you leave we might never see each
                    other again.
          Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought.

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind
          tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks.
          Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of
          his thigh.
          As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off
          and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.

          EXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY

          Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut
          rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it
          might not make the trip back.
          In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.

          

                                                                     29.

          

                              JERRY
                    What's your cash price?

                              GEEZER
                    I said in the ad. Thousand dollars
                    firm.

                               JERRY
                    Thousand, huh? That must be with a
                    guarantee.

                              GEEZER
                    As is, where she is.

                              JERRY
                    I don't know. Those rusty propane
                    tanks are a fire hazard. The roof
                    probably needs work. I couldn't go
                    above eight hundred.
          The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and
          goes inside the RV to inspect.

                              ESTELLE (O.S.)
                    There are mouse droppings in all
                    the closets, Jerry.

                              GEEZER
                    I might take nine fifty.

                              JERRY
                    Nine hundred.
          Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their
          attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming

          PUPPIES.
          She brings one of them over.

                              SHEENI
                    Look, Nick!
          She shows him the ugly little pug. Short droopy ears, a tiny,
          batlike face.

                              NICK
                    Great.

                              SHEENI
                        (to the geezer)
                    How much?

                              GEEZER
                    Ten dollars.
          Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly. Nick fishes through his
          wallet.

          

                                                                  30.

          

                              NICK
                    All I have is a Subway card with
                    four stickers.

                              GEEZER
                    Sold.

                              NICK
                    No doubt close to the dog's actual
                    value.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, thank you, Nickie!
          She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her
          attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. Nick
          looks on with appropriate jealousy.

                              SHEENI
                    I'm going to name him Albert.
                        (pronounced Al-bear)

                              GEEZER
                    That don't sound like any kind of
                    name for a dog.

                              SHEENI
                        (scowling defensively)
                    I'll have you know I've named him
                    after the deceased French writer,
                    Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger
                    and other works of existential
                    brilliance.
          The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of "I stand
          corrected." Nick returns with a nod that says "You have no
          idea."

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          The Lincoln now tows the rusty RV behind it. Nick watches
          Sheeni continue to fawn over Albert.

          INT. CAFE - DAY

          Nick and Sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts. Nick
          watches her play with Albert in her lap.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, I think I love you.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, your hormones certainly do.
                    And oddly enough, my hormones like
                    you too.

          

                                                                  31.

          
          Sheeni releases Albert and the mutt paws at her legs. Her
          eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can
                    visit each other when I get a
                    drivers license.

                              SHEENI
                    I hope that's true, but.. It's not
                    that. It's...

                              NICK
                    What?

                              SHEENI
                    It's my parents. They're... I fear
                    they will never allow me to keep
                    Albert.

                              NICK
                    Oh.
          Nick tries to hide his hurt. Picks up the paper with
          annoyance.

                              SHEENI

                        (SNIFFLING)
                    Nick, honey. Why don't you take
                    Albert? He could be our love child.

                              NICK
                    No way.

                              SHEENI
                    At least you could consider it,
                    honey. For me. I've never asked you
                    for anything before.

                              NICK
                    Maybe I could take him, but I'd
                    have certain conditions. I would
                    have to be the only dad on the
                    scene.
                        (matter of fact)
                    Trent would have to go.

                              SHEENI
                    That's asking a lot. Trent worships
                    the ground I walk on.

                              NICK
                    It's your choice. Life with me and
                    the dog you love. Or a pet-free
                    existence with a shallow,
                    egotistical poet.

          

                                                                  32.

          
          Sheeni ponders this.

                              SHEENI
                    OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any
                    choice. I'll break up with Trent.
                    But if he kills himself it's on
                    your conscience.

                              NICK
                    I accept full responsibility.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, good, that's settled.

                              NICK
                    Not quite, darling. I want one more
                    thing.

                                 SHEENI
                    What?

                              NICK
                    What do you think?
          A beat. Sheeni looks pensive. It fades to amusement.

                              SHEENI
                    Do you have a condom?
          Nick lifts his eyebrows. Now we're getting somewhere!

                              SHEENI
                    It has to be in a safe place. A
                    nice comfortable bed. With no
                    threat of interruptions. And for
                    relaxation and mood setting some
                    good red wine, preferably French. I
                    want a new condom. Not one that's
                    been riding around in your wallet
                    for years. Consumers rated them a
                    while back. I suggest you get their
                    top-rated brand. This may take some
                    research in the library. I'd
                    appreciate a photocopy of the
                    article. Plus, for supplementary
                    protection, I want a name brand
                    spermicide.

                              NICK
                    How about I have a quick vasectomy
                    just to be on the safe side?

                              SHEENI
                        (matter of fact)
                    Well, Nick, that, of course, is up
                    to you.

          

                                                                      33.

          
          Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle
          loads up the trunk.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni.
                    It's time to hit the road.
          Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused
          at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick
          the dog.
          Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in
          and gives him a peck on the cheek.

                              SHEENI
                        (whispering in his ear)
                    Don't forget, darling. Red wine and
                    Consumer Reports.
          She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard.
          He grabs her and kisses her deeply.
          Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off.

          INT. LINCOLN - DAY

          Nick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers.
          Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both.

                              JERRY
                    Okay. Back to civilization!
          He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert
          slobbers all over Nick.
          Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror,
          waving in the road.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have a tall mountain to climb,
                    with many treacherous glaciers
                    still to cross, but finally, I have
                    obtained a stamped entry visa to
                    the paradise that lay beyond.
          Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the
          horizon.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    In short... I have a very real
                    prospect for getting laid.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

          

                                                                  34.

          

          

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          The Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home.

          I/E. LINCOLN - DAY
          They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used
          to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction.

                              JERRY
                    You see that, Babe. They caved.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother
          with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes
          its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry
          decides it's parked.
          There comes a woman's scream from inside the house.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the
          living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly
          against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy.

                              NICK
                    I guess they didn't cave after all.
          Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.

                              JERRY
                    Boy, everything's complete. There's
                    even water in the windshield
                    washer.

                              ESTELLE
                    How did they ever get it in here?
                    My front door can't be more than
                    three feet wide.

                              JERRY
                    Looks like they brought it in piece
                    by piece and then reassembled it.

                              ESTELLE
                    But it would take an army of
                    mechanics to do all that!
          Jerry slams down the hood.

                              JERRY
                    Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.

          

                                                                  35.

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          A cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister,
          Joanie gets out of the back. She tips the driver, and as she
          crosses the front yard, gawks at the RV sitting in the drive.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Nick's door is ajar. Nick pulls up his trousers and comes
          into the hall. He listens to the voices downstairs.

          STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight
          of his mother and sister staring up at him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, your sister came all the way
                    from LA for a weekend visit!
          Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow.

                                NICK
                    Stellar.

          INT. ESTELLE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table.

                              JERRY
                    Can someone do something about the
                    mutt?
          The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks
          Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor.

                              ESTELLE
                    I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do
                    something about the monstrosity
                    dripping oil in my living room?

                              JOANIE
                    Yeah, I noticed that. What's the
                    story?

                              NICK
                    Jerry tried to outsmart a few
                    sailors. It's been an amusing saga.
          Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides
          against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's
          corner.

                              JERRY
                    OK, Babe, I guess when I come back
                    from my next haul I'll just have to
                    take it apart piece by piece.

          

                                                                  36.

          
          Estelle takes a deep breath and tries to let the matter rest.

                              JOANIE
                    Up to anything scandalous these
                    days, Nick?

                              NICK
                    I was going to ask you the same
                    thing.

                              JOANIE
                    What do you mean?
          Nick puffs out his chest. Joanie looks down at her boob-job.

                              JOANIE
                    Not that it's any of your business,
                    but I've taken a class to improve
                    my posture.
          Nick rolls his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    I think Joanie looks very nice. And
                    she has a new boyfriend too.

                              NICK
                    Did you meet him in posture class?

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.

                              JOANIE
                    Really now? Are you on each others'
                    Myspace pages?

                              NICK
                    Hardly. Sheeni believes the
                    internet will be the end of
                    literacy.

                              JOANIE
                    So it's to be a torturous snail
                    mail exchange, huh?

                              NICK
                    More like the occassional collect
                    call.

                              ESTELLE
                    Collect calls? And just who do you
                    expect to pay for that?
          Jerry kicks the dog away from his sock. Albert growls and
          prepares for another charge.

          

                                                                    37.

          

                              JERRY
                    Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car
                    is put together?

                              NICK
                    No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't
                    interest me.

                              JERRY
                    See, Estelle, I told you the kid
                    was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!
          Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor,
          revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's
          sack. The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws.

                              JERRY
                    Damn it! The dog!
          He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog
          retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the
          floor.
          Joanie and Nick exchange a smile. The phone rings. Estelle
          gets up to answer it.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, put the dog in the basement.

          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Nick stoops to secure the leash around the piping. He regards
          the little pug. Albert WHIMPERS and cocks his head.
          The door at the top of the stairs opens and Estelle descends
          the first few steps.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, that was your father on the
                    phone. He lost his job.

                              NICK
                    How unlike him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Watch your smart mouth. This means
                    the end of child support.

                              NICK
                    Which means...

                              ESTELLE
                    You'll have to start going to...

                        (DISTORTED)
                    Oakland Public School.
          In Nick's eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death.

          

                                                                  38.

          

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Morning comes through the drapes. The phone on the side table
          is ringing. Nick emerges from his room and picks it up.

                              NICK
                    Hello?

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Will you accept a collect call from
                    Sheeni Saunders?

                              NICK
                    Absolutely.
          Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and
          darts inside.

          INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

          BLACKNESS. Then Nick pulls the cord and the naked bulb kicks
          on.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? How are you?

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I'm well, Nickie.

                              NICK
                    And how is Trent? Not too suicidal
                    I hope.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her
          shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. WE INTERCUT.

                              SHEENI
                    Of course, he was disconsolate, but
                    we talked all day and he's come to
                    see this as an opportunity for
                    growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted
                    me to tell you that he bears you no
                    ill will.

                              NICK
                    Nor I him. I wish him all the best.

                              SHEENI
                    His parents are sending him to a
                    French speaking boarding school
                    this year. He's sure to get along
                    there. So how is my darling Albert?

          

                                                          39.

          

                              NICK
                    Well, though he's taken a disliking
                    to Jerry.

                              SHEENI
                    And you, Nickie? How are you?

                              NICK
                    I regret, Love of My Life, my
                    father has lost his job and I will
                    now be forced to go to public
                    school.

                              SHEENI
                    How unfortunate. What did he do?

                              NICK
                    He's a writer - sort of. He writes
                    advertising copy.

                              SHEENI
                    Really?
                        (pensive beat)
                    Nick, I suggest we look at your
                    father's firing as a blessing in
                    disguise.

                              NICK
                    How so?

                              SHEENI
                    I propose we get your father a job
                    here in Ukiah and you can come and
                    live with him.

                              NICK
                    Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of
                    Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage
                    culvert to be with you.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know
                    Progressive Plywood is looking for
                    an assistant editor. It would be
                    perfect for your father.
          Nick furrows his brow with skepticism.

                              NICK
                    I had no idea you had knowledge of
                    the employment opportunities of
                    trade magazines.

                              SHEENI
                    The owner is the father of a friend
                    of mine.

          

                                                                  40.

          

                              NICK
                    Anyone I know?

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?

                              NICK
                    So why would Trent want to help my
                    father move to Ukiah?

                              SHEENI
                    I told you, darling. Trent harbors
                    you no ill will. I will have him
                    call your father up pretending to
                    be a head hunter.

                              NICK
                    Very well, but I don't see how I am
                    to live with him. My mother values
                    my indentured servitude.

                              SHEENI
                    You must influence her to send you
                    away. I feel this will require
                    being in a constant state of open
                    revolt on your part.

                              NICK
                    What do you want me to do?

                              SHEENI
                    I propose you rent the film Rebel
                    Without a Cause as soon as
                    possible. You must emulate James
                    Dean...
          CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS.

                              SHEENI
                    ...You must be bad, Nickie. Be
                    very, very bad.
          A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes.

                              NICK
                    I will, darling. I will!
          And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without
          a Cause through the windshield.

          

                                                                   41.

          
          Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her
          face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop,
          watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy
          clubs.

                              ESTELLE
                    Kids? This is Officer Lance
                    Wescott. He has some bad news.
          After a beat, Nick rolls down the window.

                               LANCE
                    Your mother's friend Jerry had a
                    heart attack in a bar in Dallas.
                    He's dead.
          Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to
          Lance.

                              ESTELLE
                    Will they be sending his
                    belongings?

                              LANCE
                    Uh... I'm afraid they've already
                    been sent. To his wife.
          Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother.

                              ESTELLE
                    His... His wife?!?
          She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance
          Wescott's arms.

                              LANCE
                    There, there, Ma'am. It's going to
                    be okay.
          Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a
          beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume
          watching the movie.
          Estelle's cries of despair become...

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          ....the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with
          the repeated exclamation of Lance's name.
          Nick rolls over in bed. Bloodshot eyes. He hauls himself out
          of bed.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have decided to create a
                    supplementary persona named
                    François.

          

                                                                     42.

          

          INT. BATHRROOM - NIGHT

          He stands in front of the mirror and leans in.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Like a Parisian James Dean, he will
                    be bold, reckless, contemptuous of
                    authority, and irresistible to
                    women.
          PUSH IN on his reflection, as a moustache appears. Then a
          beret and black and white striped shirt. Then a cigarette
          holder and Thompson machine-gun. And FRANÇOIS is born.

                              NICK
                    Hello, François. I think you'll do
                    nicely.

                              FRANÇOIS
                    Oui, I am ze perfect match pour une
                    Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni
                    Saunders. I have ze calculating
                    intelligence...

                              NICK
                    ...the itchy trigger finger...
          François cocks the machine-gun.

                       NICK                            FRANÇOIS
          ...and cojone grandes!            ...and cojone grandes!

          INT. BATHRROOM - DAY

          Nick opens the door. Lance and Estelle shower behind the
          frosted glass.

                              NICK
                    Damn! Those hippos are taking a
                    shower together. How repulsive!
          He slams the door.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Nick comes down the stairs. He reaches the water heater and
          starts spinning the knob.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          The forms of Estelle and Lance in the shower can be made out.
          They both start screaming as they are blasted with cold
          water. The blobs of their bodies press up against the glass.

          

                                                                     43.

          

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Albert looks up at Nick and lets out a BARK. Nick smiles and
          bends down to undo his leash.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY -DAY

          Lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers, looking for
          blood. He hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs. Albert
          comes hurtling around he corner, almost losing his footing on
          the hardwood floor.

          ALBERT'S POV
          as we lunge at Lance's crotch.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM rises up from the home.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Estelle hands Lance an ice-pack and he applies it to his
          injury. Nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table.

                              NICK
                    Where's Joanie?

                              ESTELLE
                    She's sleeping in.

                              NICK
                    No doubt. I don't think anyone got
                    a wink last night with all that
                    racket.
          Lance looks at him, seething inwardly. He glances to Estelle.

                              NICK
                    I thought there were laws in this
                    city against illicit cohabitation.
                    Or are they just another big
                    policeman's joke?

                              LANCE
                    Kid, you are asking for trouble.

                              NICK
                    What are you going to do? Shoot me
                    with your gun?
          Lance lunges across the table.

                              ESTELLE
                    No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.
          Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door.

          

                                                                  44.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    Where do you think you're going?

                              NICK
                    Out!
          The screen door slams behind him.

          INT. GARAGE - DAY

          The garage door rattles upward, illuminating the cardboard
          box of paint supplies. Nick bends down and picks up a can of
          aerosol spray-paint. He shakes it.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - EVENING

          Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands
          over them.

                              ESTELLE
                    What the in God's name has gotten
                    into you?!? Jerry paid good money
                    for that trailer!

                              NICK
                    And just what makes you so sure it
                    was me?

                              ESTELLE
                    Who the hell else would write such
                    a thing?
          Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been
          defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE.

                              ESTELLE
                    And just how do you explain this?
          She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey.

                              NICK
                    That's Lacey.

                              ESTELLE
                    And just who the hell is Lacey?

                              NICK
                    Dad's girlfriend.
          Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and
          envy.

          

                                                                  45.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    His girlfriend? What are you doing
                    with a picture like this of your
                    father's girlfriend?

                              JOANIE
                    C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have
                    pictures like that to...

                              ESTELLE
                    When I want your opinion on raising
                    my child, I'll ask for it.
                        (to Nick; morbidly

                         CURIOUS)
                    And what's this Lacey tart like?

                              NICK
                    Well, she likes fast cars and takes
                    a lot of naps with dad.
          Super:             (True)

                              NICK
                    She likes to sit on Dad's lap while
                    he eats and blow in his ear.
          Super:           (Not true)

                              NICK
                    And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and
                    he calls her "Sugar Puss."
          Super:       (True; believe it or not)
          At this point Estelle has turned bright red.

                              ESTELLE
                    You are confined to your room until
                    school starts, you sick pervert.
          She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement.

                              NICK
                    I wish I was leaving with you
                    tonight.

                              JOANIE
                    Your day will come. I never thought
                    mine would, but it did. Was all
                    that stuff about Lacey and Dad made
                    up?

                              NICK
                    I wish. Did you really take a
                    posture class?

          

                                                                     46.

          

                              JOANIE
                    Implants. I wanted them all my
                    life.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          A knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the
          headphones off his ears.

                              NICK
                    Hey, Lefty.

                              LEFTY
                    What's with your mom, Nick? She
                    gave me the third degree just to
                    come up here.

                              NICK
                    I vandalized Jerry's trailer and
                    she found my picture of Lacey.

                              LEFTY
                    Well, good thing I stole this from
                    the bookstore then.
          Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound
          volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.

                              LEFTY
                    I was reading it all last night.
                    Boy, having sex is a lot more
                    complicated than I thought. Did you
                    know you were supposed to stick
                    your pinkie in her bumhole?

                               NICK
                    You lie.

                              LEFTY
                    No way, man. Here, I got the page
                    marked.
          Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them
          flip through the manual.

                              NICK
                    Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try
                    this on Sheeni. I think this book
                    is for people who've been married
                    so long they're disgusted by the
                    sight of each other.
          They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in
          various states of foreplay.

          

                                                                  47.

          

                              LEFTY
                    Are we really supposed to be
                    that... uh... big?

                              NICK
                    I think these illustrations are
                    disproportionate for emphasis.

                              LEFTY
                    Maybe we should compare.

                              NICK
                    Perhaps we should. Just for the
                    sake of research.
          Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each
          other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their
          belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet.
          They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets
          a hint of concern in his expression.
          Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for
          the curvature.
          The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's
          lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her,
          pants around their ankles.

                                ESTELLE

                    PERVERTS!
          She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily
          tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around
          the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.

                              ESTELLE

                    FRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS!

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Lefty emerges from the room and takes off.

                              ESTELLE
                    You won't get away! I'm calling
                    your parents! PERVERTS!
          Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his
          pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound
          sex manual as they round the bannister.

                              ESTELLE
                    In my house! How dare you!
          She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks
          him upside the head.

          

                                                                    48.

          
          He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase,
          letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step.
          He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - EVENING

          Nick watches out the window.
          Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to
          LEFTY'S PARENTS. Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained
          expression.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - LATER

          Nick lays on his belly reading No Exit. He looks up when he
          hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Shadows appear
          beneath the crack in the door.
          Estelle opens the door and looks down at him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, I just want you to know that
                    I've thought about it, and I've
                    accepted that you are gay.

                              NICK
                    Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay.
                    If you're really concerned though,
                    I suggest you get me a room at the
                    Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can
                    straighten me out, it's Sheeni.
          She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone.

                              ESTELLE
                    That sounds more like a job for
                    your father. Here, he wants to talk
                    to you.
          Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door.

                              NICK
                        (into phone)
                    Hello?

          INT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - NIGHT


                               GEORGE
                    So what's this I hear about you
                    being gay?
          George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one
          hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other. WE

          INTERCUT.

          

                                                                  49.

          

                              NICK
                    What's this I hear about you being
                    unemployed?

                              GEORGE
                    Yes, but my condition is only
                    temporary. I can change it.

                              NICK
                    I hope you do. We need the money.

                              GEORGE
                    Nick, there are more important
                    things in life than money.

                              NICK
                    I know, Dad. Like getting a good
                    education. And being able to
                    respect your parents.

                              GEORGE
                    I've got two words for you. Safe
                    sex.

                              NICK
                    Thanks, Dad.
          He hangs up the phone.

          EXT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

          Intimidating PUNK MUSIC. School bus doors fold open and Nick
          steps off. The MUSIC pounds from the boom box resting on the
          hood of the Mustang GT where a pack of SKINHEADS follow Nick
          with their eyes.
          Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of ASIAN
          GANGSTERS glaring at him from their perch on the wall.

          INT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Nick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other
          against the lockers. He smiles at a pair of PUNK ROCK GIRLS.
          One of them flips him off. Nick heads into...

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          And as Nick steps into the bathroom, we follow his eyes...
          SWISH TO... a CRIP selling a bag of dope to a GOTH FRESHMAN.
          SWISH TO... a LATIN KING vandalizing the wall with the words

          LATIN KINGS WERE HERE.
          SWISH TO... a pack of WIGGERS as one of them gives the others
          a butterfly knife show-and-tell.

          

                                                                  50.

          

          INT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          WE DRIFT down the corridor where Nick dials at a pay phone.

                              NICK
                    Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick
                    Twisp. My father's name is George
                    Twisp.

                              FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
                    Has he hit you, Nick?

                              NICK
                    Not lately. But he's missed several
                    child support payments, and is not
                    looking for work. So now I'm going
                    to public school in Oakland.

                              FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
                    Not the Oakland schools!

                              NICK
                    Yes. And he's had an offer from a
                    respectable publication in Ukiah.

                              FEMALE CASEWORKER (V.O.)
                    Don't you worry, young man. I'll
                    get right on this. Don't worry.
                    We'll light a fire under that
                    deadbeat!

          EXT. OAKLAND - DAY

          Nick walks Albert down the sidewalk. Lefty crosses the street
          to him and they walk together.

                              NICK
                    Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'?

                              LEFTY
                    You'll never believe who called me,
                    Nick. Millie Filbert!

                              NICK
                    What?!? Why?

                              LEFTY
                    I dunno. She just called and asked
                    if I wanted to hang out tonight. I
                    didn't want to ask why. I need to
                    find someplace for us to get it on.
          Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to
          wait for him.

          

                                                                  51.

          

                              NICK
                    You can use my house if you want.

                                LEFTY
                    Really?

                              NICK
                    Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to
                    a movie and I'm planning on
                    stealing Jerry's trailer and
                    torching it in a parking lot, so
                    you'll have the whole house to
                    yourself.

                                LEFTY
                    Right on.
          Albert finishes his business and they resume walking.

                              NICK
                    So where you headed anyway?

                              LEFTY
                    Dr. Browerly's office. My parents
                    are making me see a shrink now.

                              NICK
                    He asking lots of weird questions?

                              LEFTY
                    You bet your left nut he is! He
                    asked if I had any lustful thoughts
                    toward my sister.

                              NICK
                    What did you tell him?

                              LEFTY
                    I told him about beating off once
                    with her brassiere.

                              NICK
                    What did you tell him that for?

                              LEFTY
                    You don't know what it's like. I
                    think they release chemicals in

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          Nick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over
          his ears. Estelle knocks and enters. Nick pulls the
          headphones down around his neck.

                              ESTELLE
                    Lance and I are walking down to the
                    movie theater. There's TV dinners
                    in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your
                    father got a job in Ukiah.

                              NICK
                    Mom? Do you think it might be a
                    good idea if I moved in with him?

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, that just wouldn't work. I
                    depend on that child support money
                    to eat.

                              ESTELLE
                    Watch your smart mouth.
          She slams the door.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The plan is simple.
          Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of
          the Lincoln.
          Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Tow Jerry's trailer to a remote
                    parking lot in Berkeley and burn it
                    to the ground.
          The hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Thus evicting myself from my
                    mother's clutches and into the arms
                    of My One And Only Love.
          Nick fires up the V-8 engine and shifts into drive, pulling
          forward. He cuts across the lawn.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    François wanted to torch the
                    trailer where it sits, but I've
                    convinced him a parking lot will
                    reduce the risk of collateral
                    damage.
          The trailer clips the corner of the house. Chunks of stucco
          fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes,
          collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of
          the home.
          Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. He
          dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear.
          The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street,
          the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          Nick cruises along sedately. He plays with the radio and
          settles on the Sex Pistols.
          He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on
          the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer.
          The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill.

          

                                                                  54.

          

          EXT. BERKELEY - DAY

          Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign.
          The car bottoms out. The trailer bounces up, coming
          unhitched.

          I/E. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward,
          released from the great weight.
          Nick smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer
          can be seen receding into the distance. He glances into the
          mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill.
          Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the
          intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel
          onto the pavement.

          EXT. BERKELEY - DAY

          Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the
          vehicular ballet unfolds.
          Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery
          van and goes into a spin. The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at
          the outdoor café look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT
          ASSHOLE bearing down on them.
          The delivery van veers out of control. The Bohemians scatter.
          The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way
          through the patio furniture and into the café.
          A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood.
          The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross
          street below.
          KWOMP! Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from
          the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.

                              NICK
                    Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!
          The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln,
          but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog.
          The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and
          desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat.
          MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer
          crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing
          into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop.
          A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in
          time to get clipped by the Lincoln.
          The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken
          transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          
          The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run,
          thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked
          building like a runaway express train.
          The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop
          explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like
          bombs.
          The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart,
          sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down
          on the spectators.
          The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken
          fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill,
          ending at Nick's feet.
          Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of
          smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of
          dazed chickens. He turns around and does his best to
          inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          WE FOLLOW Nick as he comes through the front door and is met
          with the sight of his mother and Lance staring at him from
          the kitchen table.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick let's out a yelp of pain as Lance brings a broken tree
          limb against his bare bottom. WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

          Lance looks around the room. Picks up an umbrella and

                    Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks
                    a pantsful, Nick.
          A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out
          of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's

          BMW.
          The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad.
          Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the
          window and show him some of her cleavage.

                              LACEY
                    Hiya, Nick!

                              NICK
                    Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.
          The trunk pops open.

          

                                                                    59.

          

                              NICK
                    Is there any way I could sit up
                    front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's
                    boyfriend beat me pretty badly.

                              GEORGE
                    Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots
                    get the back seat.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
          Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert.
          They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the
          fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the ash.

                              GEORGE
                    My God. Look what you've done.
          Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a
          smile.

          EXT. UKIAH - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Morning peers over the distant hills.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          The BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood
          rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp
          cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the
          car.

                              GEORGE
                    Go ahead and bring your stuff
                    inside. Lacey and I need a nap.
                    C'mon, Sugar Puss.
          Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home.
          As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his
          shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    What a competitive asshole.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's
          ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick
          sternly.

                              NICK
                    Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    She most certainly is not. As a
                    matter of fact, we've banned you
                    from her life, Nick Twisp.

          

                                                                   60.

          

                                 NICK
                    Excuse me?

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Trent Preston informed us that not
                    only were you moving here to pursue
                    my daughter, but that you're not
                    even mentally-handicapped, and thus
                    molested my wife in the shower of
                    sound mind and body.

                              NICK
                    That rat-fink-fuck!

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    You watch your language. This is a
                    Christian home. We're sending
                    Sheeni to Les École des Arts and
                    Literatures in Santa Cruz.

                              NICK
                    Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable
                    without me. We're in love.
          The ogre snorts in condescending amusement.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Then I guess it's a good thing
                    Trent is going there too. She'll
                    have someone to console her.
          And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's
          face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and
          forth.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen. Sheeni
          emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a
          lavender dress.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick! Oh, Nick!
          Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They
          kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to
          reach under the sweatshirt.

                              SHEENI
                    I had to sneak away just to see
                    you.

                              NICK
                    That's okay. I had to burn down
                    half of Berkley.

          

                                                                     61.

          

                               SHEENI
                    That was you? Nick, are you out of
                    your mind?

                              NICK
                    I felt a grand gesture was
                    required, darling.
          Sheeni's expression indicates that she is touched, but it
          turns to troubled.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, Trent betrayed us.

                              NICK
                    François will kill him later.

                              SHEENI
                    Who's François?

                              NICK
                    Nevermind. The point is we must
                    elope.
          Sheeni takes a step back at the notion.

                              SHEENI
                    I don't know, Nick. I do love you,
                    but I don't want to spend the rest
                    of our lives on the run.

                              NICK
                    It's a small price to pay.
          She takes another step back.

                              SHEENI
                    I... I can't, Nick.

                              NICK
                    What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don't
                    get it. I'm here. Albert's here
                    too.

                              SHEENI
                    I know, Nick, and I've been longing
                    for you so. But we'll just have to
                    find another way. The car is
                    already packed.
          Nick nods glumly and Sheeni seems overcome with remorse.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to
                    accept defeat so easily!

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  62.

          
                              SHEENI (cont'd)
                    When the time is right, you must
                    make your way to Santa Cruz. And
                    then we will make love.
          Nick lifts his gaze with renewed determination.

                              NICK
                    Or we could consummate here in the
                    woods.

                              SHEENI
                    Did you bring the consumer reports?
          Nick just blinks blankly.

                              SHEENI
                    Then it will have to be Santa Cruz.
                    I really must go now, darling.

                              NICK
                    Well... Goodbye, Sheeni. I love
                    you.

                              SHEENI
                    I love you too. Squeeze darling
                    Albert for me.
          She pulls her hood over her head. Nick watches wistfully as
          she slips away into the forest.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    I have endured a five million
                    dollar beating for nothing.

                        (BEAT)
                    I have been stabbed. Stabbed in the
                    back.

          INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

          Two WRESTLERS slam down onto the mat below us.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I do not have a friend within a
                    hundred miles. This is a daunting
                    thought if you think about it.
          WE TRACK down the row of other students, starting with a
          THREE HUNDRED POUND BEHEMOTH. The row seems to descend in
          weight class, until we reach Nick at the very end.

                                                   CUT TO:
          Nick does his best to not be pinned by DWAYNE CRAMPTON, who
          out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds.

          

                                                                  63.

          

          INT. BOYS SHOWER ROOM - DAY

          Nick rinses off. Dwayne steps up to the shower head next to
          his. Nick glances his way and quickly recoils at the
          repelling landscape of rolling pink flab.

                              DWAYNE
                    Sorry `bout wompin' ya. I'm Dwayne.

                              NICK
                    Nick. Nick Twisp.

                              DWAYNE
                    Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys
                    got only two testicles when we got
                    ten fingers and toes?

                              NICK
                    I could not begin to speculate.
          Nick turns off his shower and slinks away.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick comes up the dusty road toting his backpack.
          On the porch of the Saunders' home, a handsome but somewhat
          unkempt PAUL SAUNDERS, mid-twenties, blows cool jazz on a
          beat-up trumpet.

                              PAUL
                    Hey, Nick. I'm Paul, Sheeni's
                    brother.
          Nick comes up the path to meet him.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Paul. How did you know my
                    name?

                                 PAUL
                    We've met.

                              NICK
                    No we haven't.

                              PAUL
                    In a previous life.

                                 NICK
                    Oh.
          Paul begins rolling a joint.

                              PAUL
                    Nice fire in Berkeley.

          

                                                                    64.

          

                              NICK
                    Did Sheeni tell you that was me?

                              PAUL
                    She didn't have to.

                              NICK
                    Why? Was I an arsonist in a
                    previous life?

                              PAUL
                    No. But Sheeni was.

                              NICK
                    My God. What did she burn?

                              PAUL
                    Men. Men and boys.
          Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          An empty hallway. PSYCHEDELIC SOUND plays.
          Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the
          hall. He breaststrokes through the air toward us.

          INT. GEORGE AND LACEY'S ROOM - DAY

          He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet
          touching carpet. He looks into the mirror and finds François
          lounging on the bed behind him.

                              NICK
                    My God, François! What was Paul
                    smoking?

                              FRANCOIS
                    Shut up and go with it.
          Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing
          Lacey's lingerie.
          Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN
          AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing
          nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs.
          He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E.
          He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic
          straps to fasten the bra onto his head.
          He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys
          rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg
          movements.

          

                                                                  65.

          
          As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from
          the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his
          shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly.

                              GEORGE
                    What the... What the hell?
          Nick gives a startled jump.

                              LACEY
                    Is..? Is that my bra?

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - NIGHT

          Nick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober.
          George works on a jug of zin.

                              GEORGE
                    We're calling that fruitcake
                    display strike one. Two more
                    strikes and it's back to Oakland.
          Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with
          Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her.

                                 DWAYNE
                    Hey, Nick!
          Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet.

                              NICK
                    Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you
                    doing here?

                              DWAYNE
                    Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be
                    roommates! Ain't that zinky?
          Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing
          after the dog.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here
                    and take yer sleepin' pill. You
                    must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy.
                    I don't serve two shifts.

                              NICK
                    Uh... Dad? What's going on?

                              GEORGE
                    Mrs. Crampton's our new
                    housekeeper. I'm renting out the
                    spare room to her seeing as her
                    camper has been deemed unfit for
                    human habitation.

          

                                                                     66.

          

                              NICK
                    What about Dwayne?

                              GEORGE
                    He's bunking with you.

                              NICK
                    Dad!

                              GEORGE
                    You working on strike two?
          Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone
          takes their seats at the table.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the
          creaky bed behind him.

                              DWAYNE
                    Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed
                    with me? It'll be tons warmer.

                              NICK
                    No thank you, Dwayne.
          A knock at the door. Lacey enters.

                              LACEY
                    This came for you, Nick.
          Nick sits up in bed to receive the letter. As Lacey leaves,
          he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents.

                              DWAYNE
                    Is it a love letter, Nick?

                              NICK
                    I don't know, it's in French. Say,
                    why does your mother give you
                    sleeping pills?

                              DWAYNE
                    `Cuz otherwise I'd stay up all
                    night playin' Nintendo Wii. Say,
                    Nick, can I walk Albert?

                              NICK
                    I don't know. Dogs don't grow on
                    trees.

                              DWAYNE
                    Pleeease, Nick?

          

                                                                  67.

          

                              NICK
                    Okay. But it will cost you one
                    sleeping pill per walk.

                              DWAYNE
                    Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?

                              NICK
                    You never know when sedatives will
                    come in handy.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick emerges from the home. He makes his way down the road.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          He stops at the familiar sight of My Green Haven. He gets an
          amused smile and sighs with nostalgia.
          The front door of the trailer opens and Lefty emerges. Nick
          furrows his brow in confusion as Lefty locks the door and
          comes down the path.

                              NICK
                    Lefty?

                              LEFTY
                    Oh. Hey, Nick!

                              NICK
                    Lefty, what are you doing here?

                              LEFTY
                    I live here. The guy's only
                    charging me fifty in cash a month.

                              NICK
                    I mean, what are you doing in town?

                              LEFTY
                    I did what you told me, Nick. I
                    threw my backpack off the pier and
                    reported my own suicide. I even
                    left a note.

                              NICK
                    Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed.
                    Faking your suicide is pretty
                    ballsy.
          Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road.

                              LEFTY
                    So where you headed?

          

                                                                  68.

          

                              NICK
                    Redwood High School.

                              LEFTY
                    Can I come?

                              NICK
                    Why would you want to go to school
                    if you didn't have to?

                              LEFTY
                    It's weird, Nick, but school seems
                    like a pretty fun place to hang out
                    once you get rid of classes and
                    homework.

                              NICK
                    I can see this stunt really has
                    liberated your mind.

                              LEFTY
                    I'm telling you, Nick: killing
                    myself was the best thing that ever
                    happened to me.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

          A rowdy cafeteria. Lefty and Nick dine in the corner. Nick
          has an open French textbook as he tries to decipher Sheeni's
          letter. An Indian boy, VIJAY JOSHI, 16, makes his way to
          them.

                              VIJAY
                    May I sit at your table?

                              LEFTY
                    Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.

                              VIJAY
                    I am Vijay Joshi.
          Vijay sits and shakes their hands.

                              VIJAY
                    I see you both have been rejected
                    by the socially elite of our
                    school. Ukiah is a cultural
                    wasteland compared to India. Though
                    some of the girls are very
                    attractive.

                              NICK
                    Do you have a girlfriend?

                              VIJAY
                    Not at the moment. But I am
                    optimistic. How about you?

          

                                                                     69.

          

                              NICK
                    Yes, but she transferred.

                              VIJAY
                    You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I
                    heard she was interested in some
                    brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.

                              LEFTY
                    Hey, that's you, Nick.

                              VIJAY
                    I'm surprised. You are not at all
                    what I imagined.
          Nick narrows his eyes.

                              VIJAY
                    So how is Sheeni?

                              NICK
                    I don't know. She sent me this
                    letter. But it's in French.

                              VIJAY
                    Shall I translate it for you?

                              NICK
                    You speak French?

                              VIJAY
                    I speak French, English, Hindi,
                    Marathi, and Urdu.

                              LEFTY
                    That must come in handy.
          Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it
          silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes
          at him in annoyance.
          Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud.

                              VIJAY
                    Dear, Nick...

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - SUNSET

          In Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk
          which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...I am writing you from my room in
                    Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding
                    school has proven to be a welcome
                    liberation as well as...

          

                                                                     70.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...a stimulating experience which I
                    am now not so quick to change.
          Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other GIRLS walk around
          scantily clad behind her.

                              SHEENI
                    Perhaps you should consider
                    learning French and enrolling. That
                    said...

          INT. ÉCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÉRATURE - HALLWAY - DAY

          Sheeni chats up a gathering of HANDSOME BOYS in the hall.
          They regard her lustfully.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...English cannot be spoken on
                    campus even if you are hemorrhaging
                    from an accidental limb amputation.

          INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY


                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I have made friends with the head
                    of the girls' basketball team. Her
                    name is Heather, and despite her
                    popularity, she is saving herself
                    for college boys.
          HEATHER, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of
          the BASKETBALL TEAM for a yearbook photo.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT


                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I have an interesting roommate from
                    New York named Taggarty...
          TAGGARTY, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan
          sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid
          of a sleepy BOY.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    She has already slept with
                    seventeen boys and hopes to rack up
                    fifty before leaving here.
          Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids.
          She writes the boy's grade (C-) beneath his image.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          The distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent.

          

                                                                     71.

          

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    Trent has taken up windsurfing and
                    has been designated target number
                    one by all the girls. I am still
                    very angry at him for the betrayal
                    but he claims he wants to mend our
                    friendship.
          The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching
          BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS gasp in horror.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I guess we shall see.

                    All in all, I'm happy and look
                    forward to further growth in this
                    rich, intellectual environment.
          Vijay sets down the letter. Nick waits a beat, staring in
          disbelief.

                              NICK
                    That's it? Nothing else about me?
          Vijay picks up the letter again.

                              VIJAY
                    Oh yes... Love to you and Albert.
                        (setting down the letter)
                    Who's Albert?

                              NICK
                    Albert is our dog. This is a
                    disaster. What the hell does she
                    mean Trent wants to mend the
                    relationship?

                               VIJAY
                    I don't know, but this Taggarty
                    girl sounds very uninhibited. I
                    wonder if she's made it with a
                    Hindu yet.

                              LEFTY
                    Heather sounds like a babe. You
                    think if I grew a beard I'd pass
                    for college age?

                              NICK
                    I've got to get to Sheeni as soon
                    as possible. If I don't Trent
                    Preston is going to mindfuck her
                    into thinking she doesn't like me.

          

                                                                  72.

          

                              LEFTY
                    And then he'll probably fuck her in
                    other ways. Did you know you're
                    supposed to put your pinkie in a
                    girl's bumhole, Vijay?

                              NICK
                    Will you shut up and help me out?

                              LEFTY
                    Sorry, Nick. What should we do?

                              NICK
                    I suggest we steal my father's BMW
                    and take a trip to Santa Cruz.
                    Vijay, you'll have to be our
                    translator.

                              VIJAY
                    But what will we tell our parents?

                              LEFTY
                    You can tell your father you are
                    staying at Nick's house for the
                    weekend. And visa versa.

                              NICK
                    Good thinking.

                              VIJAY
                    But what if we are caught?

                              NICK
                    To hell with it, Vijay. It's time
                    to take action!
          THREE CUTS. The JINGLE as Nick removes his Dad's keys from
          the bureau. The trunk SLAMMING closed with the sleeping bags
          inside. The ROAR of the engine as Vijay's hand turns the key
          in the ignition.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          As Vijay drives, Lefty holds up a road map in the back seat.
          Nick places a CD in the stereo and TAKE FIVE fills the car.

                              LEFTY
                    What is this music, Nick?

                              NICK
                    It's Dave Brubeck.
                        (to Vijay)
                    I thought a person as cultured as
                    yourself would appreciate it.

          

                                                                     73.

          

                              VIJAY
                    You want culture? I will give you
                    culture.
          Vijay puts in his own CD and Ravi Shankar's TARANA blasts
          from the speakers.
          Nick gives Vijay a grin of approval. MUSIC PLAYS OVER...

          EXT. REDWOOD FORESTS - DAY

          WE FLY through the forest to keep up with the Beamer.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          The BMW passes cars on the Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Beamer navigates the winding curves of the highway where
          green hills meet the Pacific Ocean.

          EXT. ÉCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÉRATURE - DUSK

          The car pulls to a stop in the parking lot, the school
          looming beyond, slightly obfuscated by a light drizzle. The
          music cuts out with the engine.

          EXT. ÉCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÉRATURE - GROUNDS - DUSK

          The grouping of BOYS part as we move through them. Finally,
          we reach the center of their attention...
          Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather standing together in their
          coats.

                              SHEENI
                    Nickie?
          Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older
          boys around them.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Sheeni.
                        (to Taggarty and Heather)
                    Hi, I'm Nick.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Oh. So you're Nick.

                              HEATHER
                    We've heard so much about you.

                              NICK
                    And this is Vijay. And this is
                    Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.

          

                                                                  74.

          

                              LEFTY
                    And I'm not gay.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, I knew you'd come!
          Sheeni glances over at the disapproving MATRON. She leans in
          close.

                              SHEENI
                    ...but you must wait in the car
                    until we can sneak you in.
          Nick nods in understanding.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          An empty hall. The SNEAKY STRINGS of NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN.
          Sheeni rounds the corner at the far end. As she and Heather
          sneak the boys down, the other OCCUPANTS of the floor giggle
          in French and dart from door to door in near-undress.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          A cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed, two small
          desks, an army surplus dresser, and a stuffed armchair.
          Sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser.

                              HEATHER
                    Lefty, should maybe sleep in my
                    room. It's pretty crowded in here.

                              LEFTY
                    Your roommate won't mind?

                              HEATHER
                    Oh, Darlene went home for the
                    weekend.
          Lefty gulps and picks up his grip. He pauses in the hallway.

                              LEFTY
                    Well, see you guys in the morning.
          The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance.

                              SHEENI
                    Pardon me, everyone.
          Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. Vijay and Nick
          regard the...

          WALL OF TAGGARTY'S CONQUESTS
          a series of mug shots of sullen-looking TEENAGE BOYS. Most of
          them have been given a grade of C- or below.

          

                                                                    75.

          

                              NICK
                    There's your competition.

                              VIJAY
                    A distinguished group I would be
                    happy to join.
          The two boys turn around and watch in hot-blooded bliss as
          Taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie.

          INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink.

                              VIJAY
                    I am in a state of sexual frenzy.
                    What is your plan?

                              NICK
                    We drape a blanket over the lower
                    bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle
                    Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a
                    condom. I slipped two to Lefty,
                    leaving us with four.

                              VIJAY
                    What if they don't go for it?

                              NICK
                    They'll go for it. You can cut the
                    sexual tension in that room with a
                    knife.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT


                              SHEENI
                    Don't be silly, darling. Not with
                    others in the room.
                        (leaning in to whisper)
                    We must wait until everyone falls
                    asleep.
          Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and
          climbs into her narrow bed.
          As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor,
          they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky.

                              TAGGERTY
                    Goodnight boys. Do you need the
                    light on to take off your clothes?

                              NICK
                    No.
                        (flipping off the light)
                    We can find our zippers in the
                    dark.

          

                                                                    76.

          
          A beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door.
          There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks
          the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a
          MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor.
          Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male
          shadow are whispering to each other.
          After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges
          into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back
          into bed as if nothing happened.

                                 NICK
                    Sheeni?

                                 SHEENI
                    Yes, Nick?

                              NICK
                    Was that the matron?

                                 SHEENI
                    No.
          Beat.

                              NICK
                    Then who was it?

                              SHEENI
                    It was Trent.
          Beat.

                              NICK
                    Did you say it was Trent?

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. He came to discuss our
                    friendship. I told him now was not
                    the time.

                              NICK
                    So where is Trent now?

                               SHEENI
                    I assume he went back to the boys'
                    dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are
                    keeping everyone awake with your
                    inquiries.
          Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind
          to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above
          the dresser. François can be made out sitting by the window
          in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson.

          

                                                                    77.

          

                              FRANÇOIS
                    Now is our chance.

                              NICK
                    Chance for what?

                              FRANÇOIS
                    To confront our nemesis. We must go
                    to the boys' dorm and kill Trent
                    where he sleeps.

                              NICK
                    I suppose we should at least get a
                    look at him. To see what we're
                    dealing with.

                               FRANÇOIS
                    Very well.
                        (stubbing out his

                         CIGARETTE)
                    You see what we are dealing with...
                    and zen I wll deal wiz it.
          And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a
          whindbreaker. He creeps down the hall.

          EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT

          The school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background, a
          searchlight sweeping the grounds.
          The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of
          the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys'
          dorm.

          INT. BOYS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the
          colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors.
          He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts
          the names TRENT and ED.
          Nick knocks on the door.
          It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in
          a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON.

                              NICK
                    Trent?

                              ED
                    No. Who the hell are you?

          

                                                                   78.

          

                              NICK
                    I am Nick Twisp.

                              ED
                    Oh, so you're Nick.

                              NICK
                    Is Trent here?

                              ED
                    You just missed him, Nick. He just
                    grabbed a couple condoms and left.

                              NICK
                    Did he say where he was going?

                              ED
                    I think he said he was going to
                    Heather's room.

                              NICK
                    But that's where Lefty is. Who are
                    you?

                              ED
                    Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.

                              NICK
                    Oh, so you're Ed.

                              ED
                    What's that supposed to mean?

                              NICK
                    Nothing. It's just that Sheeni
                    mentioned Trent has a thing for a
                    guy named Ed, and that he touches
                    the guy when he falls asleep. But
                    obviously if that were you, you'd
                    know about it. Must be a different
                    Ed Solomon. Take care now.
          Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him.

          EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT

          The security van continues to make its rounds. We find Nick
          crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm.
          He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes
          a deep breath.
          As the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it.
          TRACK with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the
          next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar
          blasts and machine gun turret fire.

          

                                                                  79.

          

          
          At long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick bangs on the door. Heather answers in little more than a
          G-string and Nick seems to forget his mission just long
          enough to appreciate her body.

                              HEATHER
                    What's up, Nick?

                              NICK
                    Is Trent in there?

                              HEATHER
                    Not anymore.

                              NICK
                    What happened to Lefty?

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    I'm right here, Nick.
          Nick peers past Heather where he finds Lefty standing naked
          in the moonlight.

                              HEATHER
                    Trent was here, but he left. He
                    only dropped by to lend us a couple
                    more condoms.

                              NICK
                    But I gave Lefty two already.

                              HEATHER
                    Yes, and that was very generous of
                    you, but the night is young.

                              NICK
                    So what is Trent, the fucking
                    condom faerie!?!

                              LEFTY
                    You can have one of ours, Nick. If
                    you need one.
          The fact that Nick doesn't yet raises his temperament even
          further.

                              NICK
                    So where did he say he was going?

                              HEATHER
                    He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure
                    I just saw him go into our bathroom
                    down the hall.

          

                                                                    80.

          

                              NICK
                    Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with
                    those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed
                    said that Trent pokes holes in them
                    so that he can get Sheeni pregnant
                    and be with her forever.
          And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them.

          INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          There is the CLAP of thunder outside as Nick throws open the
          door to the girls' bathroom. He looks around with murderous
          rage.
          There comes the sound of someone vomiting.
          Nick kicks in the stall and finds BERNICE LYNCH, 17, a thin
          platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. She hurls
          into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick.

                              BERNICE
                    Who are you?

                              NICK
                    I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to
                    disturb you.

                               BERNICE
                    That's OK. It was something I ate.
                    So wait, are you Sheeni's
                    boyfriend?

                                NICK
                    Uh, yeah.

                              BERNICE
                    My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch.
                    Not that you asked.

                              NICK
                    Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually,
                    I think Trent Preston mentioned
                    you. He said you were frumpy, but
                    now that I've met you, I can see
                    Trent is a lying bastard.

                              BERNICE
                    Thanks. And Trent can go to hell
                    for all I care. Sheeni too.

                              NICK
                    You don't like Sheeni?

          

                                                                     81.

          

                              BERNICE
                    Personally, I hate her guts. Well,
                    pardon me, Nick. I feel like
                    throwing up some more now.

                              NICK
                    You didn't happen to see Trent
                    Preston did you?
          She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again.
          Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile.

                              BERNICE
                    I did actually. I think he was on
                    his way to Sheeni's room.
          Nick's eyes widen in alarm.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking.
          Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk.
          He watches the moon lit forms thumping together.
          He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom
          bunk. He moves toward her.
          She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him.

                                 NICK
                    Sheeni?

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, darling.

                              NICK
                    Was Trent here?

                                 SHEENI
                    Yes, Nick.
          Nick hangs his head.

                              SHEENI
                    But I sent him away again.
          Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he
          finds nothing but adoration.

                              SHEENI
                    Because I want you, darling. Not
                    even Trent can match the
                    industriousness and tenacity with
                    which you have pursued me.

          

                                                                     82.

          
          She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into
          her bed as...
          The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit
          by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight.

                              MATRON
                    Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?
          Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk.
          He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent
          standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his
          features difficult to make out but his white teeth are
          definitely smiling diabolically.

          EXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT

          The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the
          matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their
          heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves,
          cheering the boys' escape.
          Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up.
          Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again
          as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the
          Vietnamese Army.
          They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets
          in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking.
          Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team
          catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as
          Nick peels out.
          INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the
          night.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
          Lefty lets out a holler of joy.

                              LEFTY
                    I did it three times! Two long ones
                    and a quickie.

                              NICK
                    Great. Just great. How about you,
                    Vijay?

                              VIJAY
                    It was difficult to tell with that
                    condom, Nick. Why did you buy such
                    thick ones?

                               NICK
                    That brand was top-rated by
                    Consumers.

          

                                                                  83.

          

                              VIJAY
                    Well, she's safe. No organism could
                    penetrate those walls.

                              NICK
                    You think the girls are in trouble?

                              VIJAY
                    They will likely notify their
                    parents. Perhaps even expel them.

                              NICK
                    That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni
                    will have to come back to Ukiah.
          The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          The rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear.
          Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched.

                              VIJAY
                    What will we do?

                              NICK
                    Well, we can't stay in the car.
                    Sooner or later Highway Patrol is
                    going to come by and ask for our
                    non-existent driver's license.

                              LEFTY
                    But we have no money!

                              VIJAY
                    I have no shoes! I'll catch
                    pneumonia and die a indeterminate
                    proto-quasi-virgin!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          A couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There
          is ringing on the other end.

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Hello?

                              NICK
                        (into phone)
                    Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake
                    you, but I'm hoping you'll help
                    your only son. Especially seeing as
                    it would really piss off Dad.
          A long beat.

          

                                                                    84.

          

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Where are you, Nick?

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay
          phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker.
          A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash
          twice and Nick runs out into the road.

          POV TRUCK DRIVER
          Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities.
          The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to
          reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot
          tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down
          at our three waylaid adventurers.

                              WALLY
                    Pardon me. But is one of you Nick
                    Twisp?
          The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if
          this is how people go missing.

                              NICK
                    Yeah. I'm Nick.

                              WALLY
                    I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your
                    mom's.
          Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is
          actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being
          sent on a midnight mission.

                              WALLY
                    So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you
                    need a ride. Did I mention I'm a
                    friend?
          Nick breaks into a smile. Finally the Gods have cut him a
          break.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Wally and Estelle watch the three semi-clothed boys shovel in
          fried liver with no complaint.

                              ESTELLE
                    Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He
                    came to help me in my time of
                    mourning.

          

                                                                  85.

          

                              NICK
                    What happened to Lance?
          Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind
          look from Wally and she softens.

                              ESTELLE
                    Lance is busy training to be a
                    detective. He isn't around as much
                    as he used to be.
          Nick nods and goes back to eating.

                              ESTELLE
                    Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him
                    a question, Nick.

                              NICK
                    Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous
                    actress was married to Frank
                    Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey
                    Rooney?

                              LEFTY
                    Whoever she is, she sure gets
                    around.

                              WALLY
                    Ava Gardner.
          Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the
          gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    That's nothing. You should see what
                    he did with the living room.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway.
          Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was
          now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all
          the furniture placed back in the original positions.
          At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared
          by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies
          that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has
          achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall.
          Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.

                              ESTELLE
                    Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
          Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights
          come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow.

          

                                                                     86.

          

                                NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
                    Ooooooh.
          Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on.

                                NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
                    Aaaaaaah.
          Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his
          head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat
          next to Estelle.
          Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they
          listen to the Chevy play them Elvis' LOVE ME TENDER.
          The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it
          brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression.

          EXT. UKIAH - DAY

          The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out.
          Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the
          wheel of the truck.

                               WALLY
                    Well, uhm... It was nice meeting
                    you, Nick.

                              NICK
                    You too, Mr. Rumpkin.
          Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to
          turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves
          goodbye.
          Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty
          road.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Lacey works up a sweat to Billy Blank. Nick comes through the
          door. He's still in his underwear.

                              NICK
                    Where's Dad?

                              LACEY
                    In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother
                    him, Nick. He's in a foul mood.
                    He's on with the police. Apparently
                    someone broke in and stole his
                    Beamer.
          Lacey gives Nick an amused smile.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Lacey! Get in here!

          

                                                                  87.

          
          Lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom. Nick sits
          down with Dwayne at the breakfast table.

                              DWAYNE
                    Nick, you got a girlfriend?

                                 NICK
                    Yes, I do.

                              DWAYNE
                    If you asked your girlfriend as a
                    favor, would she do it with me?

                              NICK
                    Guys don't share their girlfriends.

                              DWAYNE
                    I get ya. You're worried `cause
                    your girlfriend might get knocked
                    up. What if I pull out, Nick?
          Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back
          bedroom and Lacey emerges.

                              LACEY
                    It's not my fault, you tight-assed,
                    critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Sticks and stones. It doesn't
                    bother me if you sleep on the couch
                    from now on.

                              LACEY
                    Does it bother you that you're a
                    selfish, uptight, boring lover?

                              NICK
                    You forgot lousy driver!
          George appears in the doorway.

                              GEORGE
                    That's strike two, jerkoff!
          Nick hangs his head. George moves about the kitchen chugging
          from a jug of zin. Lacey picks up the ringing phone.

                               LACEY
                    Hello?

                        (PAUSE)
                    Thank you.
          Lacey hangs up the phone.

          

                                                                  88.

          

                              LACEY
                    They found your car in Davenport,
                    George. Go pick it up.

                              GEORGE
                    Look who's wearing the pants this
                    morning.
          Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs.

                              LACEY
                    Nick, I feel for you. It must be
                    tough being a teenager in this
                    house.

                              NICK
                    My mother wasn't any better.

                              LACEY
                    Your mom has had a difficult time.
                    She has had a great deal to put up
                    with. I'm starting to appreciate
                    that now.

                              GEORGE
                    Are you by any chance referring to
                    me?

                              LACEY
                    If the shoe fits, suck on it.
          George swills some zin and mumbles ominously.

                              GEORGE
                    We'll see who's sucking on what
                    soon.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY


                              VIJAY
                    I spoke with Taggarty this morning.
                    She requested a wallet sized photo.
          Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on
          the table, his facial growth is almost respectable.

                              LEFTY
                    Congratulations, Vijay. That makes
                    it official. Welcome to the club.
          Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins.

                              NICK
                    What grade did you receive?

          

                                                                    89.

          

                              VIJAY
                    A C+. Which I feel is perfectly
                    satisfactory given the conditions.

                              LEFTY
                    I guess this means they're not
                    being expelled.

                              VIJAY
                    No, apparently they convinced the
                    matron it was all quite innocent.

                              NICK
                    Are you kidding? She had her
                    flashlight trained on your Hindi
                    boner!
          A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst.

                              VIJAY
                    No need to be jealous, Nick.
          Nick stands and collects his lunch tray.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and
                    sent back to me I will need a
                    partner in crime.

          INT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY

          Nick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Luckily, François has a girl on the
                    inside.
          Nick begins typing and speaking out loud.

                              NICK
                    Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting
                    you this weekend in the bathroom.

          INT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY

          Bernice reads the letter.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I just want you to know I now see
                    why you loath Sheeni Saunders so
                    strongly.

          INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - DAY

          Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the HEADMASTER
          as the matron describes the events.

          

                                                                  90.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I too have come to despise the
                    snooty, pretentious brunette and in
                    all honesty you should probably get
                    her expelled. I am happy to help in
                    that regard.

          INT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have included a number of
                    sleeping pills with this note.
          Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    You must introduce one of these
                    into her breakfast beverage each
                    day.
          Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being
          ignored. Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee
          nonchalantly.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Sheeni watches the INSTRUCTOR.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    She may be intelligent, but she is
                    not likely to pass her courses when
                    she's falling asleep in class.
          Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE
          across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her
          notebook.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Since meeting you, I have come to
                    realize my interest in Sheeni was
                    only a transient adolescent
                    infatuation. I like you more than I
                    can say. Take courage. Together we
                    will outsmart these cake eaters.
          A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name
          with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession.

          INT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY

          Nick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with
          himself.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Affectionately yours, Nick.

          

                                                                     91.

          
          He looks around for observers, looks back at the screen
          pensively, and resumes typing.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    P.S. Please destroy this note
                    immediately.

          ON A MAILBOX
          As Nick deposits his letter.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - EVENING

          Nick wanders up the drive. WE FOLLOW him into the house.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - CONTINUOUS

          ...where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot
          message on the couch.

                              NICK
                    Where's Dad?

                              LACEY

                        (DREAMILY)
                    Daddy is in Davenport. Where you
                    left his car.

                              PAUL
                    We saved you some mushrooms, Nick.
          Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag
          full of mushrooms and considers them.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Nick pukes his guts into the sink.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.
          He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls.
          There comes the strange warbled sound of a TRUMPET from the
          next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we
          hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of I WANT TO BE SEDATED.
          Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion.

          ON THE BOOK
          as the nude figures suddenly BECOME ANIMATED, making
          wonderful love.
          Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page.

          

                                                                  92.

          
          WE FOLLOW Nick as he follows the nude figures who do
          acrobatics down...

          THE HALL
          and into...

          THE LIVING ROOM
          where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet.
          Nick marvels. The phone rings.

                               LACEY
                     Nick? Get the phone?
          Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's
          feet.

                               NICK
                         (into phone)

                     Quit fooling around, Nick. This is
                     your dad. Is everything okay there?

                               NICK
                     Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything
                     will be okay. You deserve to be
                     loved.

                               GEORGE
                     What the hell is that supposed to
                     mean? Is Lacey there?

                               NICK
                     Lacey is here. Paul is caressing
                     her toes.

                    Paul is our friend. He makes

                    They're naked.

                              GEORGE
                    Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?

          He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord.
          He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet.

                              NICK
                    Dad is afraid.

                              LACEY
                    He is on the wrong path. I have
                    felt that for some time.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick watches the headlights from the arriving BMW travel
          across the walls.
          They go out. He listens to the front door being keyed
          followed by his father bellowing.
          Nick gets up and wanders into...

          LIVING ROOM
          where Paul stands between George and Lacey.

                              PAUL
                    Okay, George, just calm down.
          George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to
          the floor.

                              GEORGE
                    You are in serious trouble. You've
                    assaulted me and I know for a fact
                    that you two were having naked
                    orgies with my son. That child is
                    only twelve years old.
          George gets to his feet.

                              NICK
                    I'm sixteen, Dad.

          

                                                                  94.

          

                               GEORGE
                    Shut your pie hole!
                        (turning to Lacey and

                         PAUL)
                    That boy is an underaged minor. I'm
                    going to have you arrested and
                    charged with child molesting.

                               LACEY
                    Don't be an idiot, George. No one
                    was naked.

                              GEORGE
                    When you get out of prison, you
                    will both have to register as sex
                    offenders. You will never be able
                    to get a decent job again.

                              PAUL
                    I've never had a decent job. I
                    don't think I'd want one.

                              LACEY
                    Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick
                    up the rest of my things tomorrow.

                              GEORGE
                    Not until you pay me the rest of
                    the money you owe.

                              LACEY
                    I paid you all your money!

                              GEORGE
                    Not the extra charges.
          She gets up in his face.

                              LACEY
                    Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges.
          As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders
          back toward his room.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Using bad language in front of a
                    minor. The judge will hear about
                    that too.
          Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him.
          SWISH TO... Dwayne playing Nintendo naked. He looks over his
          shoulder.

                              DWAYNE
                    What's all the ruckus about?

          

                                                                  95.

          

                              NICK
                    Dwayne! Please cover yourself.

                              DWAYNE
                    You wanna play Nintendo all night?

                              NICK
                    Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go
                    to sleep.
          Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just
          sits there on the floor, naked as a clam.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - THE DEAD OF NIGHT


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    A strange night. I dreamed of
                    wrestling for what seemed like
                    hours with an amorous walrus...
          Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the
          red abstract background.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - MORNING

          Nick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where
          his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    There is only one explanation: I
                    have been Dwayned.
          A pillow whacks across a blubbery face.

                              NICK
                    Wake up! I know what you were doing
                    last night, you disgusting beast!

                              DWAYNE
                    Don't be mad, Nick. I like you.
          Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight.
          ...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in..

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne!
                    Where's yer pajamas?

                              DWAYNE
                    Nick made me take them off, Mom. He
                    took off his too.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    You leave my son alone. Don't go
                    co'rupt him with yer nastiness!

          

                                                                     96.

          

                              NICK
                    We weren't doing anything, Mrs.
                    Crampton. It was just hot last
                    night.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    If you get hot, boys, open a
                    window. Don't go takin' off yer
                    pajamas. That's nasty.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick dials on the phone. Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast,
          cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair.

                               TAGGARTY (V.O.)
                    Bonjour.

                              NICK
                    Taggarty? It's Nick.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - DAY

          Taggarty's at her desk. Her thick rimmed glasses almost make
          her look studious. WE INTERCUT.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to
                    talk to Sheeni.

                              NICK
                    If you please.
          Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up
          among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait.

                              TAGGARTY
                    It's your would-be-lover.
          Sheeni sleepily takes the phone.

                               SHEENI
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Hello, My Beloved. How are you?

                              SHEENI
                    Not so well. I have been afflicted
                    with some kind of chronic fatigue.

                              NICK
                    Perhaps you are home sick. You do
                    sound rather blue.

          

                                                97.

          

                    SHEENI
          I'm not home sick, Nick. In fact,
          I'm not very happy with you.

                    NICK
          Me? What did I do?

                    SHEENI
          You know damn well, Nick. You've
          been spreading rumors about Trent.
          And he doesn't deserve it.

                    NICK
          Doesn't deserve it!?! I'd have to
          claim he has genital warts to sink
          to his level.

                    SHEENI
          Well, whatever you said to Ed
          Solomon, it was enough to get him
          to give Trent a black eye.

                    NICK
          Sheeni, I just don't get it. This
          guy has cock-blocked at every turn
          and you're taking his side?!?

                    SHEENI
          Cock-blocked?

              (SIGHS)
          We'll have to resume this another
          time, Nick. It's been an
          emotionally exhausting weekend. My
          parents are in an uproar over Paul.
          He's moved some floozie in with him
          up in the studio over the garage.

                    NICK
          Lacey's not a floozie.

                    SHEENI
          Lacey? You know her?

                    NICK
          Of course. She's my father's ex-
          girlfriend. I think that might make
          you my stepmother-in-law.

                    SHEENI
          Nick. Don't be gross.

                    NICK
          Sorry. At any rate, I'll let you
          go. We'll have plenty of time to
          settle this tomorrow.

          

                                                                     98.

          

                                SHEENI
                    Tomorrow?

                              NICK
                    Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be
                    coming for dinner, of course.

                              SHEENI
                    Don't even think it, Nick. You know
                    my parents don't approve of you.

                              NICK
                    I'm confident they will learn to
                    love me. After all, I'm practically
                    family.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, you must dismiss this
                    Thanksgiving notion from your mind.
                    I remain firm on this issue.
                    Goodbye.
          CLICK. Nick regards the phone defensively. He puts it down
          and takes a seat at the table.
          He glares at Dwayne as they eat breakfast. There comes a
          knock at the front door.

                              NICK
                    Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get
                    it.

          I/E. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY
          A POLICE OFFICER stands on the steps. Nick goes wide eyed at
          the sight of him and visibly slumps.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Is George Twisp in?

                              NICK
                    Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping
                    off a hangover, Officer. Is he
                    under arrest?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Under arrest? No, I'm the officer
                    working the case of his stolen car.

                                NICK
                    Ah.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    You can tell your pop that the CD
                    he found in his car is Ravi
                    Shankar.

          

                                                                  99.

                    Indian music. So we're a checkin'
                    the INS files, see if we can get
                    some prints that match. You
                    wouldn't know anyone who might have
                    stolen the car who listens to this
                    crap, would ya, son?

                              NICK
                    No, and I'm not sure I like the
                    implication. Ravi Shankar is
                    beloved by many Caucasian...

                              DWAYNE (O.S.)
                    What about Vijay Joshi?
          Nick stands stiff as a board. The officer peers around him at
          Dwayne sitting inside.

                              DWAYNE
                    I'm pretty sure he's Injun.
          The officer makes a note.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                        (to himself)
                    Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it.
                    Thank you, boys.
          Nick gives a weak smile and closes the door.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mrs. Crampton complained to Dad
                    that I tried to corrupt the fat
                    pervert cohabitating with me.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick totes boxes of belongings from the house to the
          Crampton's dilapidated camper.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    He has deemed it strike three, but
                    is only banishing me as far as Mrs.
                    Crampton's condemned trailer.

          INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

          A view of the thin birch walls. We come to rest on Nick,
          shivering under an electric blanket. There's a blob of snot
          on his upper-lip.

          

                                                                    100.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    No matter. Tomorrow I will be
                    reunited with My Everlasting Love.
                    And I will not be stopped. Not by
                    an outbreak of the plague, nor by a
                    cruel return of the ice-age. Not
                    even by the Gods themselves.

          Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket.
          He scurries into the house.

          INT. BATHRROOM - DAY

          Nick showers.
          Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror. He applies
          hair gel.
          Nick examines the whitehead on his brow. He pinches and a
          glob of puss smacks the mirror.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          He emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner
          into the...

          LIVING ROOM
          where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the
          remote and snatches up the phone.

                              NICK
                    Twisp residence.

                                 ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nickie, I have some bad news!
          Nick sighs.

                              NICK
                    Okay. I'm ready. What is it?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into
                    a terrible row. He tried to arrest
                    Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw.

          

                                                                    101.

          

                              NICK
                    What's the bad news?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    The Berkeley police know you
                    started the fire. Lance told them
                    where you are.
          Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car
          pulling up outside.

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nick, they're coming to arrest you!
          He slams down the phone.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          The window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping
          to the ground. He takes off running through the woods.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick pounds on the door.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Nick?
          Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of
          groceries under his arms.

                              NICK
                    Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?

                              LEFTY
                    Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's
                    been arrested.

                              NICK
                    Arrested?!?

                              LEFTY
                    For grand theft auto. They found
                    his prints in your father's car.

                              NICK
                    That's terrible. Did he go quietly?

                              LEFTY
                    No. He said you were his accomplice
                    and now the Ukiah police are
                    looking for you!
          We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then -

          

                                                                   102.

          

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up
          with Nick as he flees.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The day has proven to be a
                    disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I
                    have a decision to make.

          EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the
          bridge and continues down the road.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I could hit the road and spend my
                    life a fugitive with my integrity
                    nearly intact.

          UNDER THE BRIDGE
          Nick squats in the shadows. He's holding a bouquet of
          municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his
          tie.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    It's that or risk incarceration to
                    keep my dinner date.

                        (BEAT)
                    Obviously the answer is clear.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Nick peers through the bushes at the mobile home across the
          street. A squad car crawls past, the rover squawking a terse
          description of a teenage white male.
          Nick emerges from the shrubs and approaches the house.
          He rings the ornate Victorian doorbell. Paul answers in an
          apron.

                              PAUL
                    Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come
                    in.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Lacey floats toward him and gives him a hug.

                              NICK
                    Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.
          She spots the sad flowers in his hand.

          

                                                                 103.

          

                              LACEY
                    What interesting flowers, Nick. Who
                    are they for?

                              NICK
                    Uh, Mrs. Saunders.
          Lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz-bedecked parlor.
          Sheeni's larger-than-life father and 5,000 year old mother
          sit cross-legged on the floor, running their hands over the
          hooked rug.

                              LACEY
                    Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember
                    Nick Twisp, don't you?
          Mrs. Saunders coos and takes the flowers. Her husband squints
          up at him.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    You are very, very tall.

                              PAUL
                    No he's not, Dad. He just appears
                    tall because you are on the floor.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    I can feel the floor pushing
                    against me. Can you feel it too,
                    tall youth?
          Nick glances over at Mrs. Saunders who is now eating the
          flowers.

                              LACEY
                    Paul served an appetizer earlier.

                              PAUL
                    Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in
                    the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.
          Nick smiles with amusement.

                              TAGGERTY (O.S.)
                    Hello, Nick.
          Taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs, cloaked in a
          green cape.

                              TAGGERTY
                    How is the star-crossed persistent
                    lover?
          She greets him with a casually intimate kiss.

          

                                                                 104.

          

                              NICK
                    Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?

                              TAGGERTY
                    Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming
                    and hid in her room.

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick knocks and enters to find Sheeni sprawled on the bed
          with a book.

                              NICK
                    Dinner is almost ready, My Love.

                              SHEENI
                    I do not intend to be party to my
                    brother's absurdities. He has
                    allowed you in and drugged my
                    parents.

                              NICK
                    I think they are deriving some good
                    from the experience.
          Sheeni finally looks up from her book.

                              SHEENI
                    What are you doing here, Nick? I
                    expressly asked you not to come.

                              NICK
                    To hell with that. What do I have
                    to do to prove my love to you? My
                    friends have gotten laid and I'm
                    pretty sure neither one of them was
                    beaten with a tree trunk, raped by
                    a walrus, or had to contend with
                    the likes of Trent Preston!

                              SHEENI
                    You were raped by a walrus?

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I
                    have committed crimes, I have
                    traveled to the lengths of the
                    state and still you won't give me
                    this one little thing.

                              SHEENI
                    Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say
                    it? That's what you want. You want
                    me to have sex with you.

          

                                                                    105.

          

                               NICK

                        (BEAT)
                    Well... YEAH!
          A beat as Nick's open admissions makes her consider his
          point. She sighs and shakes her head.

                              SHEENI
                    How is my dog?

                              NICK
                    Excellent. He should be coming out
                    of the oven right about now.
          She tosses the book at him, but he dodges it successfully.

                              SHEENI
                    I hate you, Nickie!
          She stands up and tries to slap him. He grabs her wrists and
          pulls her to him.

                              NICK
                    I hate you too.
          They share a long, intense kiss.
          They break away and she smiles in spite of herself.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          The Saunders and extended family take their seats at the
          polished mahogany table crammed with turkey, yams, mashed
          potatoes, and cranberry sauce.
          They all lower their heads and Lacey leads them in prayer.

                              LACEY
                    Dear Lord...
          Mr. Saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends
          badly.
          The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have
          their heads solemnly bowed.

                              LACEY
                    Dear Lord, thank you for this
                    bounty. Help us to be tolerant of
                    others - especially the boyfriends
                    and girlfriends of our immediate
                    relations. Amen.

                              EVERYONE
                    Amen.

          

                                                                 106.

          
          They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search
          light briefly coming through the windows.
          Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes
          and apply it to his face like war paint.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    Paul? Your father looks rather
                    strange.

                              PAUL
                    Well, mother, he is sitting in his
                    own bowel movement.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    That's no excuse.
          Another helicopter passes overhead.

                              TAGGARTY
                    The food is delicious, Paul.

                               PAUL
                    Thank you.

                        (BEAT)
                    Sister, darling, how long has it
                    been since we all observed the
                    rituals of Thanksgiving?

                              SHEENI
                    Not long enough, Paul.

                              NICK
                    I hope it's the first of many such
                    occasions for me.
          Sheeni narrows her eyes at him.
          A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then-
          Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/
                    Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright...
          Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others
          accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a
          drumstick.

                              EVERYONE
                    Round yon virgin Mother and Child/
                    Holy infant so tender and mild/
                    Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep
                    in heavenly pee-eace.

          

                                                                    107.

          
          And with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens
          the door.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Oh, Trent, you made it.
          Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his
          entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but
          rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous
          features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy
          of Ed Solomon, still remains.

                              TRENT
                    Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.
          Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the
          pitcher and pours water into his own lap.

                              SHEENI
                    Trent, darling, this is Nick.
          Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes.

                              TRENT
                    Nick, at last we meet.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Trent.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Have a seat, Trent.

                              TRENT
                    I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay.
                    I have bad news.

                              SHEENI
                    What is it?

                              TRENT
                    Bernice Lynch has tried to commit
                    suicide.
          Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard.

                              TRENT
                    She swallowed a number of sleeping
                    pills, and is now in a coma.

                              SHEENI
                    The poor girl.

                              TRENT
                    There's more. Before I left school,
                    I searched her room.

          

                                                                 108.

          

                              NICK
                    Did you obtain proper authorization
                    from the officials?

                              TRENT
                    No, Nick, I acted on my own
                    initiative. In Bernice's closet, I
                    found this letter.
          He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket.

                              TRENT
                    In the letter, the writer
                    instructed Bernice to begin
                    sedating Sheeni with drugs he
                    himself supplied.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Nick, you didn't!

                              NICK
                    Well, you see...

                              SHEENI
                    Nick! You could have killed me!

                                MR. SAUNDERS
                    Who died?

                              TRENT
                    No one yet, Mr. Saunders.
          Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS

                    ARREST HIM!

                              TRENT
                    I can't arrest him. But I have
                    called the Santa Cruz Police. They
                    are on their way here now.
          Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.

                              NICK
                    Well, I shall be going now. Please
                    continue without me.

                              TRENT
                    Nick, I suggest you remain here and
                    face the consequences like a man.
          Nick stops in front of Trent.

          

                                                                   109.

          

                              NICK
                    Thank you for that unsolicited
                    counsel, Trent. And please, do drop
                    dead.
          The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the
          doorway.

                              NICK
                    Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for
                    you.

                              SHEENI
                    You are completely contemptible,
                    Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you
                    again.
          With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick
          leaves.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Nick's silhouette figure racing through the trees.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Here I am, reviled by friends and
                    family. Relentlessly pursued by
                    three police jurisdictions.
          Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Fronçois suggests we flee the
                    country. But where to go? Mexico?
                    Canada? India, perhaps?
          He looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing
          squad cars.

          EXT. LOS ANGELES - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          The downtown high-rises protrude from the layer of smog. In
          pre-lap, someone pushes a door BUZZER repeatedly.

          INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Joanie opens the door and finds Nick on her doorstep.

                              NICK
                    Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going?

                               JOANIE
                    Nick?

          

                                                                 110.

          

          INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - LATER


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Since my sister can see through me,
                    I'm obliged to give a relatively
                    candid and thorough review of the
                    events.
          Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome
          parts of the story. Nick finishes, flopping into a chair.

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, six months ago you were just
                    another brownnosing honor student.
                    What happened?

                              NICK
                    I'm not really sure. I fell in love
                    with Sheeni. All I want is to be
                    with her. The rest is all a big
                    misunderstanding.

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, you've stolen, vandalized,
                    trespassed, and burned down
                    Berkeley. All for one girl. If
                    there's a misunderstanding, it's
                    with your insight into females.

                              NICK
                    But... But where did I go wrong?

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, boys your age are always
                    looking for the path of least
                    resistance to becoming a man. A
                    boy's whole self-esteem rests on
                    how fast he can get a girl into
                    bed.

                              NICK
                    So far, I agree.

                              JOANIE
                    Sooner or later what those boys
                    realize, is that the girls you're
                    chasing base their self-esteem on
                    how many hoops they can get the boy
                    to jump through before going to bed
                    with him.
          Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him.

                              JOANIE
                    So I guess what you should ask
                    yourself is: How far are you
                    willing to go?

          

                                                                 111.

          
          Nick nods in understanding. An epiphanic smile.

                              NICK
                    All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to
                    go all the way.
          Joanie nods in amusement.

                              JOANIE
                    You can stay here a couple days,
                    but eventually they'll come looking
                    for you. I don't have much money to
                    give you, but here.
          Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved.

                              NICK
                    Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love
                    you.

                              JOANIE
                    I love you too, you little brat.

          INT. LOS ANGELES BUS TERMINAL - DAY

          Nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the
          window.

                              NICK
                    One ticket to Ukiah, please.

          INT. LANCE'S DUMP - BATHROOM - DAY

          Lance squats on the toilet in a neck brace. He chuckles over
          an issue of Penthouse. The phone rings. He picks it up

                              LANCE
                    Yeah.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Hey, bacon boy, it's Nick.

                              LANCE
                    Nick, ya little prick, where are
                    ya?

          EXT. LOS ANGELES BUS TERMINAL - DAY

          Nick is crammed into the phone booth. He's wearing shades and
          a fedora. WE INTERCUT.

                              NICK
                    You're on a need to know basis,
                    gorilla boy.
          Lance seethes inwardly.

          

                                                                 112.

          

                              LANCE
                    No matter, they'll get you
                    eventually.

                              NICK
                    Let me make it easy. I'll be at
                    Redwood High School tomorrow
                    morning. Round up your donut
                    dipping friends. I'm turning myself
                    in.
          Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond.

          I/E. BUS (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to
          him.

          EXT. UKIAH - DAY

          And the bus flies past the sign that says WELCOME TO UKIAH.

          EXT. UKIAH BUS STOP - NIGHT

          Nick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings
          underneath.

                              NICK
                    Lefty?
          Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend.

                              LEFTY
                    Nick? What are you doing here?
                    Everyone and their mother's mother
                    is looking for you.

                               NICK
                    They have me soon enough. Where are
                    you going?

                              LEFTY
                    Home. I'm done being dead, Nick.
                    Heather and I are going back to
                    Oakland for Christmas. You should
                    have heard how glad my parents were
                    that I didn't kill myself. They
                    were even happier when they found
                    out I'm not gay.

                              NICK
                    That's great, Lefty.

                              LEFTY
                    Yeah, being in love is pretty
                    great. So what's your plan, Nick?

          

                                                                    113.

          
          Nick answers with only pensive silence.

          EXT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Nick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in
          another display of clairvoyance.

                              PAUL
                    Welcome back, Nick. We had a
                    feeling you were coming.

          INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

          Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch
          the infamous "chicken scene" in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Paul and Lacey are kind enough to
                    share some leftover fungi to help
                    calm my nerves. That, combined with
                    yet another viewing of James Dean's
                    performance is what gives me my
                    final burst of inspiration.
          They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his
          automobile just in time to escape demise.

          INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

          As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a
          bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of
          make-up that make him...
          ...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards
          his female alter-ego in the mirror.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    François of course wants no part of
                    this, and demands that we make a
                    run for the border. But I have
                    decided to veto him. It's time to
                    face the music.

          INT. BMW 325I - DAY

          Nick turns the key in the ignition and CHRISTMAS MUSIC rises
          from the speakers. And the music plays over...

          EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          ...where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's
          arrival.
          Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge.

          The parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and FBI
          vans, the news crews, REDWOOD HIGH STUDENTS, and an
          apparently CALIFORNIA WIDE NICK TWISP CULT FOLLOWING.
          TINA MANION, 17, speaks into a STUDENT NEWS CREW CAMERA.

          There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the
          student camera-man to the road on the ridge where...
          George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school.

                                 GEORGE
                       Hey. That's my car!
          The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges.

          NICK'S POV
          of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn
          out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel.

          ON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD
          staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne,
          George, Lacey, Paul...
          Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity.
          The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few
          Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S

          MINGLE.
          Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones.
          And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back
          into his father's car and peels out.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through
          the cloud kicked up in his wake.

          

                                                                    115.

          
          Nick pops in a CD and turns up the Christmas music to drown
          out the sirens.

          EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - DAY

          He zips across the covered bridge, the train of law
          enforcement in hot pursuit.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          He yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road.
          A few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side-long
          through a picket fence.
          Nick takes the switchbacks at 60 per, wheels practically
          sliding off the turns.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          The BMW crests the hill and smashes through the chain link
          gate.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          As Nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge, he
          undoes his seat belt.
          He goes for the door handle, eyes going wide when he finds
          power lock has engaged.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          The BMW hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air,
          tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood.
          The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside-
          down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a
          thundering SMACK.
          Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the
          crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole
          in the ice.

          UNDERWATER
          The BMW descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles.
          As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber
          TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are...

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Where a crowd of family, friends, and fans stand around in
          mourning garb over the funeral ceremony.

          

                                                                    116.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My only comfort regarding my
                    untimely death is knowing my
                    friends and family will do just
                    fine without me.
          We move from Lacey and Paul, the latter of which is wailing
          away on the trumpet, to Lefty, his head hung low. Heather
          pulls his head to her breasts.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    As it would turn out Heather's
                    vaginal canal is slightly
                    misshapen...

          INT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - FLASHFORWARD - DAY

          Lefty humping Heather in the grass ala the scene in which we
          met him.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...and thus completely compatible
                    with Lefty's otherwise incongruent
                    penis.

                              HEATHER
                    A little to the right... a
                    little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!

                    RIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERE!

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Vijay glancing over at Taggarty as she
          smokes a cigarette.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Vijay would eventually manage to
                    pin the car theft on me. But had
                    lost the attention of Taggarty
                    forever. Who by the way...

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...never would find her perfect A.
          Taggarty at her wall. Ed Solomon lounges in the bed behind
          her.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    And would therefore start grading
                    on a curve.
          With a quick stroke of her pen, she changes Ed's grade from a
          B minus to a B plus.

          

                                                                 117.

          

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Joanie sniffling.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Joanie of course would get to
                    continue to travel the world...

          INT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - FLASHFORWARD - DAY

          Joanie serves up a beverage in first class.

                              NICK   (V.O.)
                    ...and she and   her breasts would
                    probably go on   to have the
                    wonderful life   that they deserve.
          The CELEBRITY she is serving looks from her cleavage to her
          eyes. She gives a little smile.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Estelle weeping quietly against Wally's
          shoulder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Wally as it turns out...

          INT. JEOPARDY STUDIO - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT

          Estelle watches from the audience as Wally scribbles at his
          podium while ALEX TREBECK hosts inaudibly.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...would go on Jeopardy and win,
                    ensuring my mother's blessed rise
                    to a higher economic status.
          The answer on Wally's screen says WHO IS ALBERT CAMUS? Alex
          Trebeck shakes his head, leaving Wally with only $1, but
          enough to best his two competitors.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find George puffing on a cigar, Mrs. Crampton
          behind him, his hand resting on Dwayne's shoulder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...my father, no longer burdened
                    with crippling child support
                    payments, would now be able to
                    afford the model BMW he always
                    wanted...

          

                                                                 118.

          

          I/E. BMW M6SMG - MOVING - FLASHFORWARD - DAY
          Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as
          his flab flaps in the wind.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...and would come to find the
                    surrogate son he always wanted in
                    Dwayne, the only organism alive
                    that could possibly appreciate
                    George's driving.
          As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads THUNDER

          ROD.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Leaving just one last piece of
                    business.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          And finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless. And as we
          continue to PAN we reach...
          Carlotta standing in the background. The bombshell haircut
          and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil.
          Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of
          silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE, LET'S
          MINGLE shirt and shorts that are being buried inside.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

          Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses.
          She approaches the distant Carlotta.

                              SHEENI
                    Excuse me. Are you a friend of
                    Nick's?
          Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes
          Sheeni's hand.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    A terribly old friend. Carlotta
                    Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss.

                              SHEENI
                    You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no
                    doubt culpable for Nick's actions.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Well, love does compel us to
                    desperate acts. People cannot
                    always act rationally.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                 119.

          
                              NICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd)
                    The greater the love, the stronger
                    the passions, the more reckless the
                    crimes.
          Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a
                    way of making me feel worthy of the
                    pursuit.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    My dear, if there's one thing the
                    demise of Nick Twisp has taught me,
                    it's that self worth comes from
                    within.
          Sheeni gives a pensive nod.

                              SHEENI
                    Would you like to stay the night,
                    Carlotta? We can reminisce of our
                    departed.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really
                    must...

                              SHEENI
                    It's just... I don't think I could
                    bear to be alone tonight.
          Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows.

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni
          brushes in the bathroom.
          Carlotta hastily switches out the light. Sheeni emerges in a
          few small scraps of flimsy black lace.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Goodness. What an attractive
                    negligee.

                              SHEENI
                    Do you like it? I bought it in
                    Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped
                    to wear it for Nick.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have
                    found it most... Appealing.
          Sheeni crawls into bed. She cuddles close.

          

                                                                   120.

          

                              SHEENI
                    I like lying here with you,
                    Carlotta.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    You do?

                              SHEENI
                    I can't think of anyone I'd rather
                    lie here with.
          Carlotta furrows her brow.

                              SHEENI
                    Except maybe Nick. If Nick were
                    here, what do you suppose he would
                    do to me?

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Make love to you I would think.

                              SHEENI
                    Then why don't you?

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Pardon?

                              SHEENI
                    Take off that silly wig and make
                    love to me!
          Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni! You knew!

                              SHEENI
                    Of course, Nick. Did you really
                    expect to fool your soul mate with
                    such a disguise?
          Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness.

                              SHEENI
                    Take me darling!
          And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge.
          The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah.
          The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED

          BACKGROUND.

          LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
          Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP
          with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and
          the stage erupts with fireworks.

          

                                                                 121.

          

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - MORNING

          Nick sleeps with a grin on his face. He rouses at the touch
          of Sheeni's lips on his cheek.

                              SHEENI
                    My parents are at services. They
                    won't be back for hours.

                              NICK
                    Shall we have breakfast, my love?

                              SHEENI
                    What a lovely notion, darling. You
                    go ahead downstairs and get things
                    started.
          Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the
          cradle.

                              NICK
                    What are you doing?

                              SHEENI
                    Calling Taggarty to report that you
                    are not completely incompetent in
                    the bedroom.

                              NICK
                    Do I get to stay and hear my grade?

                              SHEENI
                    Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such
                    things are reserved for girl talk
                    only. And for good reason.
          She smiles at him and he smiles back.

                              NICK
                    Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick prances into the living room in his underwear.
          He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of
          the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye. He stops
          in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps. Admires
          himself.
          François appears in the mirror behind Nick, Thompson slung
          over his shoulder.

                              NICK
                    Well, good morning, François. What
                    do you think?

          

                                                                 122.

          

                              FRANÇOIS
                    What do I sink? I sink now's are
                    chance to run for ze hills.
          Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.

                              NICK
                    What do you mean?

                              FRANÇOIS
                    Nick, we are young, yes? Is the
                    world not our oyster? Beaucoup des
                    filles. Do you not want to know
                    what it is like to make love to
                    another girl?

                              NICK
                    I do, but... We've come so far.
                    What about Sheeni?

                              FRANÇOIS
                    Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always
                    be ze first conquest, but all zis
                    time you saught zis was ze end, ze
                    one and only, when in fact it is
                    only ze beginning.
          Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany.
          In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto
          the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens.
          Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law
          enforcement vehicles pull up.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, the police are here!
          He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead.

                              NICK
                    Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the
                    back!

                              MEGAPHONE (O.S.)

                    NICK TWISP! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!

                              NICK
                    I don't understand. How do they
                    even know I'm alive?

                              SHEENI (O.S.)
                    Well, I called them of course.
          Nick spins to face her. She's standing in the doorway and
          there's not a hint of wrong-doing in her face.

          

                                                                  123.

          

                              NICK
                    Well, thanks a pantsful!

                              SHEENI
                    But, Nickie, it had to be done.

                              NICK
                    But... but why?

                              SHEENI
                    I can't very well marry a wanted
                    man, honey. Look at it this way, in
                    a few months you'll be a free man
                    and we can be together in Paris.
          Nick looks to François in disbelief. But the Frenchman just
          rolls his eyes.

                               FRANÇOIS
                    You might as well break it to her
                    now, Nick.
          A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may
          never see her again. But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick
          finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all
          along.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    François is right of course, but on
                    the other hand, why be cruel? After
                    all, Sheeni had managed to give me
                    hope every step of the way. And if
                    hope is what Sheeni would now need
                    to go on, well then...

                              NICK
                    As always, you are right, my love.
          Sheeni beams. François smacks his forehead with hand.

                              FRANÇOIS
                    Merd.
          The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson
          in his mouth and blows himself OUT OF FRAME just as...
          ...the front door bursts open and the FBI AGENTS surround
          Nick.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          The agents lead Nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked
          in the road.

          

                                                                   124.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so,
                    but the truth is... I've got the
                    world on a string.
          Sheeni emerges from the home, Albert barking in protest.
          Nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at
          her.

                              SHEENI
                    Write often, Nickie.

                              NICK
                    I will, darling.

                              SHEENI
                    And don't worry about Albert. He'll
                    be waiting for you too.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    As François would remind me, I'm
                    intelligent, healthy, virile, not
                    violently ugly... On the whole I am
                    splendidly equipped for this great
                    adventure we call the human
                    existence.
          The FBI agents shove Nick into the back of their black
          Saturn.

          INT. SATURN(MOVING) - DAY

          Nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away. A
          view of Sheeni waving in the road, Albert at her feet.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Besides, what jury would convict a
                    teenager who acted out of love?
                    And even if I do get to spend the
                    next few months of my youth getting
                    Dwayned by the inmates of the
                    California Juvenile Correctional
                    System, I did get my thirty two
                    minutes of lovemaking with one of
                    the most outstanding girls of this
                    or any other epoch.
          Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving
          figure gets ever more distant. A pensive moment as he
          actually questions...

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    But was it all worth it?
          Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it
          brings a smirk to his face.
          

                                                                  125.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    You bet your left nut it was.
          And as Tom Jones' SHE'S A LADY kicks in, we...
          

                                                             THE END
ZEROPHILIA

          FADE IN:
          
          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
          
          Mist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the
          distance.
          
          The full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN,
          splashing a one man pup tent.
          
          INSIDE THE TENT
          
          LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen
          asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly
          awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.
          
          He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
          
          He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR
          toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS
          himself against the side of the tent, as...
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop
          in the mud.
          
          Stillness.
          
          Luke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver-
          side window of the RV.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Are you all right?
          
          Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed.
          She nods 'yes.'
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       How did you even get here?       There's
                       no road.
          
                                    ALEXA
                       I'm sorry.     I'm from Utah.
          
                                    LUKE
                       It's okay.
          
                                 ALEXA
                       Are you alone out here?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
          He nods 'yes.'    She bursts into TEARS.
          
                              ALEXA (CONT'D)
                    My husband. Bastard. I've been
                    driving for days. I don't even
                    know where I'm going.
          
                                LUKE
                    Oh, wow.    I'm really sorry.
          
          She gathers herself, sniffling.
          
          
                    I have warm apple kringel in the
                    camper. Would you like some?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, what is it?
          
                                ALEXA
                    Pastry.
          
          
          INSIDE RV CAMPER
          
          Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry
          off a paper plate.
          
                              ALEXA
                    So, this "Survival Quest" is your
                    vacation?
          
                               LUKE
                    Yeah. It's my third try.     Kind a'
                    lame, huh?
          
                              ALEXA
                    No. Seven days alone in the
                    wilderness?   I'd be afraid.
          
                              LUKE
                    It's just something I really wanted
                    to do.
          
          Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.
          
                              ALEXA
                    His shoes. Fishing lures.        The
                    electric drill.
          
                                LUKE
                    Good.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
          She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.
          
                              ALEXA
                    You're all wet and muddy. Why
                    don't I hang those up to dry?
          
                                LUKE
                    Thanks.    I'm okay.
          
                              ALEXA
                    I'm propositioning you.
          
                                LUKE
                    Oh...
                    Oh, wow.
                    You are?
          
          He considers, fearful, but thrilled.
          
          
          EXT. LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING
          
          Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.
          
          The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old
          SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like
          the sliced-off front of a train engine.
          
          Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE,
          passionately making out on the sidewalk.
          
          Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the
          only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers
          Luke's massive truck.
          
                              JANINE
                    It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I
                    thought you were gettin' a pickup?
          
                              LUKE
                    I changed my mind.
          
          Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan,
          who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged,
          streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill
          Murray had a son...
          
                              KEENAN
                    It's awesome. It's pleather.
          
                                LUKE
                    Fuck you.    You think it's stupid.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          Janine stares at him.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
          She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke
          rolls up his T-shirt sleeves, she grins.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh my God. You got laid.
                    Finally! Who is she?
          
          Luke glares at Keenan.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I didn't say a word! I swear!     You
                    know Janine. She's got X-ray
                    vision.
                        (to Janine)
                    Camping! A total stranger.
          
                              JANINE
                    I knew that whole "waitin' to meet
                    the right girl" thing was crap.
                    Congratulations! I have to get to
                    Physics. The truck's great.
          
                              KEENAN
                    See ya', hottie.
          
                              JANINE
                    Could find something to call me,
                    other than what every guy in the
                    world would say?
          
                              KEENAN
                    "Sweetheart?" "Babe?"
                    "Aphrodite?"
          
          Janine sneers.    At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her
          passionately.
          
          She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.
          
          Keenan climbs up into the cab.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    So this is gonna' be like your car?
          
                                                                      5.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Look, I know it's dopey. But don't
                    you recognize it? It's painted and
                    the muffler's switched out, -but
                    this was my dad's.
          
          Keenan looks around with fresh eyes. He reaches an arm way
          up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash
          of weed.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    Ten years.     A little dried out.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          The truck barrels along through the trees.     Luke and Keenan
          share a joint.
          
                              LUKE
                    First off, that woman. We didn't
                    go all the way, you know?
          
                               KEENAN
                    Yeah?   Okay, so?
          
                              LUKE
                    You think technically I'm still a
                    virgin?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Were you inside her?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Yeah.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    It counts.     Next.   ...What?
          
                              LUKE
                    I been havin' this weird dream.
                    The thing is, I think maybe the
                    dream's real. Forget it. No way
                    I'm tellin' you.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You know enough of my secrets to
                    get me shot. Sharon's mom on
                    Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream
                    is there you can't tell me?
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    It's about part of me gettin'
                    smaller. An important part.
          
          Keenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then
          realizes Luke's serious.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin'
                    me. You're not thirteen!
          
                                 LUKE
                    Screw you.     Maybe I caught
                    something.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I think it's good you bought this
                    truck.
          
          They both LAUGH.
          
          
          INT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY
          
          A small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools
          and discarded car parts.
          
          Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke.
          
          MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair
          and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.
          
          Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck,
          chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he
          occasionally REVS for emphasis.
          
                              MAX
                    I can do the gasket for twenty
                    bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this
                    thing? Two, three hundred, maybe?
          
                                LUKE
                    Shit.    Can I hold off on that?
          
                              MAX
                    No skin off my ass. But a few
                    days, weeks, your whole
                    transmission could blow.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Ah, Jeez.     I shouldn't got this.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
          
          Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and
          SIGHS.
          
                              MAX
                    Four hundred seventy-five
                    horsepower. Twenty-eight inch
                    wheels. It's a classic. Let me
                    dig around out back. Maybe we got
                    a used set.
          
                              LUKE
                    That'd be great.   Thanks.
          
          Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back.
          
          Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender.
          
          He sits, impatient for Max to return.
          
          He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque-
          wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner
          of Max.
          
          He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of
          MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T-
          shirt, with warm, confident eyes.
          
          Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets
          down the torque-wrench.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    It's not my wrench. It's my truck.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    What's wrong with it?
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, just needs a new gasket and a
                    couple T-sprocks. The flanges are
                    sheared off.   No big deal.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You have to watch my brother, Max.
                    He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's no such thing. Last week
                    he sold Mrs. Gustafson a whole set:
                    six hundred bucks. My name's
                    Michelle.
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    From New York. Poli-Sci transfer.
                    I sort of asked around campus.
          
                               MICHELLE
                    You did?
          
                              LUKE
                    You've prob'ly already got a
                    stalker, huh?
          
                               MICHELLE
                    No.
          
          Luke stares, awkward.
          
                              LUKE
                    You heard about Cafe Lunizia?
                    Italian? They got New York style
                    pizza. Make you feel at home.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You askin' me out?
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, well, uh, -definitely!
          
          An SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and
          OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls
          over to Luke as he pumps gas.
          
                              CHAD
                    Hey, Spanky, let's go! Look
                    forward to kickin' your puck ass.
          
                               LUKE
                    My ride.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Your name's "Spanky?"
          
                              LUKE
                    No, Puck Ass, but people just call
                    me Luke. We're beatin' his frat
                    boy team in street hockey. Pisses
                    'em off.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'll talk to Max. Tell him to just
                    replace the gasket.
          
          Luke's BREATHING grows HEAVIER.
          
                                                                       9.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Thanks. So, what do you think?
                    I'll just sit there while you eat.
                    I won't even talk.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Look, I just split up with this
                    total amoeba.
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, I'm a paramecium. That's way
                    more evolved. I'm practically pond
                    scum.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Maybe I'll give you a call when the
                    truck's ready.
          
                               LUKE
                    Great.    You mean to go out, right?
          
          Michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at
          the back. Keenan approaches.
          
                              KEENAN
                        (a whisper)
                    Whoa. That was her!     Jesus, you're
                    sweatin' like crazy.
          
          Luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes BEADS of SWEAT from his brow.
          
                              LUKE
                    We're goin' out.
          
          Keenan gives him a high-five.    Luke smiles, catching his
          breath.
          
          
          INT. LUKE & KEENAN'S PLACE
          
          A small, run-down house. Hockey gear, dirty laundry and
          Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa. He munches a
          burrito while watching the game.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.)
                    KEENAN!   COME HERE, QUICK!!!
          
          Keenan leaps up.
          
                               KEENAN
                    WHAT?!
          
          He races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum.
          
                                                                     10.

          Luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the
          mirror, horrified.
          
                                LUKE
                     Look!   My chest!
          
          Keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now.
          
                                 KEENAN
                     Yeah?
          
                               LUKE
                     I had hair. Come on! Not a lot,
                     but you've seen me -some- right?
          
                               KEENAN
                     Okay, I don't know.    So?
          
                               LUKE
                     Well, where'd it go?
          
          Keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I really thought you gettin' laid
                     was gonna' help. What is it with
                     you, man? I mean, you're smarter
                     than me, you're better lookin' than
                     me.
          
                                 LUKE
                     I am not.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I know. But I'm just sayin', you
                     can get any girl you want.
          
                               LUKE
                     Easy for you, you've got Janine.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I'm still workin' on my GED. How
                     long you think Brainiac's gonna'
                     wanna' hang with that?
          
                               LUKE
                     She worships you.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Man, I'm gonna' be that wild fling
                    she had with the local dude from
                    the bike shop. "God, what was his
                    name?"
          
                              LUKE
                    You're crazy.
          
          Keenan gives him a look of "I'm crazy?"
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're gonna' have a great time
                    with her tonight. Just be
                    yourself. ...Mostly.
          
          
          EXT. CAFE LUNIZIA - NIGHT
          
          Cheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung
          with far too many white lights.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I caught him with my best friend.
                    Former. Such a cliche'.
          
                                LUKE
                    Sorry.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Winthrop Hawkins. "Hawk." From
                    this Park Avenue family. He'd know
                    what kind of mushrooms those are,
                    what the best wine is.
          
                              LUKE
                    The best wine is beer.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'm such a moron.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're not.
          
                                MICHELLE
                    No, I am.    I have incontrovertible
                    proof.
          
          She kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table,
          a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    It's a hawk. Get it? "Hawkins?"
                    See, you're smirking!
          
                               LUKE
                    I'm not.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    And it's GREEN! That's the one
                    color tattoo they can't REMOVE!
          
                               LUKE
                    Oh.   Bummer.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'm considering a prosthetic foot.
          
          She smiles.
          
          They sip from their glasses and drink each other in.
          
          Luke contemplates a kiss,...
          
          but his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS.
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter?
          
                              LUKE
                    Nothin'. Maybe just kind a' hot
                    out here. You want moron? When my
                    dad died, -it's okay, I was nine.
                    I barely knew what was goin' on-
                    But I thought the tombstone was
                    really sad looking, so I painted
                    smiley faces and fish all over it.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    That's sweet.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, I'm sure dad would've loved
                    that.
          
          His face REDDENS. Overheated, Luke tugs at his shirt,
          brushes SWEAT from his brow.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    So, what do you think makes a good
                    relationship?
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    For real? I don't know.
                    Friendship. Great sex. Knowing
                    you want to be there even when it
                    gets scary or bloody.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Whoa.     Where'd that come from?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Sorry.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    No, it's just not the usual guy
                    thing. ...You're great, you know?
          
          Luke puts his hand on his chest, FEELS something.
          
          He stands, puts on his jacket.
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you excuse me a sec'?
          
          
          NEAR THE KITCHEN
          
          HYPER-VENTILATING, his arms CLUTCHING HIS CHEST,
          
          BEADS OF SWEAT on his forehead,
          
          Luke checks the Men's Room door: LOCKED.
          
          He ducks out the service entrance.
          
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT
          By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head, WHIPS off his
          jacket and shirt, and looks down...
          
          His eyes GO WIDE.
          
                                 LUKE
                    -AAH!
          
          On his chest: FEMALE BREASTS.
          
          Two WAITERS come outside for a smoke.
          
                              FIRST WAITER
                    Table twenty-nine. Like to bring
                    her the cannoli special.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
          Luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a
          HIGH FEVER, and PASSES OUT, slumping to the ground.
          
          BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the
          ground, shirtless among bits of garbage.
          
          He watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside
          an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a
          canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory:
          
          He GRABS his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal.
          
          He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and
          staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.
          
          
          EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY - LATE NIGHT
          
          Luke's Semi THUNDERS along.
          
          INSIDE THE CAB
          
          Luke stares out in shock.
          
          He hears HEAVY BREATHING, MOANS, VOICES.
          
                               FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Oh yes!   Don't stop!
          
          He looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over.
          
          RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
          
          in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist.
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Lie down for me, baby!
          
          The HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him.
          
          As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from
          the passing car.
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined.
          
          The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR
          HORN SCREAMS by.
          
          Luke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's
          
                                                                    15.
          
          
          
          LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
          
          The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver
          appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS
          THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears.
          
          THROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD
          
          Luke stares out, EYES GLAZED.
          
          
          INT. KEENAN AND LUKE'S GARAGE
          
          The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any
          second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves,
          slugging a makeshift punching bag.
          
          Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes.
          
                              KEENAN
                    We takin' up boxing?
          
                              LUKE
                    I don't know. I am.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on? You competin' for
                    Mr. Universe this week?
          
                              LUKE
                    Everyone should just mind their own
                    fucking business!
          
          Keenan recoils at the attitude.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Didn't go so great, huh?
          
          Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD
          RAGE.
          
          He collapses in a heap.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Dude.
          
                              LUKE
                    It was goin' great. She's amazing.
                    Funny. And really smart.    And the
                    way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.'
          
                              KEENAN
                    Cool.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Then I started feelin' all weird
                    again, and,... oh, man, you'll
                    think I'm nuts... Keen, I had
                    breasts. I felt 'em.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Whoa, first date.     Definitely the
                    'new Luke!'
          
                                 LUKE
                    No!     On me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're startin' to creep me out.
                    Listen, I think I know what's goin'
                    on, okay? "Acute Adolescent
                    Anxiety." It's from the stress of
                    college, girls, grades. It's
                    really common.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm not an adolescent.    Where'd you
                    get this crap?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    The Net. I found all the symptoms
                    right off: panic attacks,
                    "Localized Alopecia" -that's hair
                    loss. This doctor wrote back, "Any
                    chance your friend, Luke, just lost
                    his virginity?"
          
                              LUKE
                    You told, -you gave him my name?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    He's a doctor, back East. He's
                    sending this information pack.
                    Look, I started thinkin' you're
                    goin' bipolar on me or somethin'.
                    Come on, man, BREASTS?!
          
          Luke considers.
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
          Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair,
          trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell.
          
          Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in
          the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.
          
                                                          17.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell
                    away from my sister!
          
          Luke GASPS for air.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    You don't say a word?! You just
                    leave her sittin' there?!
          
                              LUKE
                    I came to apologize.
          
          Max shoves him across the yard.
          
                              MAX
                    Get out a' here!   She's not home,
                    anyway.
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you tell her I came by?
          
                              MAX
                    No. She's honest with you, so you
                    bolt? And then what, you wake up
                    feelin' sorry for her?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! Is that what she thinks?   I
                    left 'cause a' what she said?
                    That's crazy! She's like the most
                    incredible girl I ever met!
          
          Max sneers, skeptical.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I had this 'pasta quattro funghi' -
                    four mushroom. It took me a while
                    to even figure it out, but I think
                    someone put shrooms in it, or
                    somehow they got in there by
                    mistake. I was hallucinating and
                    everything.
          
                              MAX
                    Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to
                    be a world-class asshole.
                    Fortunately, I'm familiar with the
                    cause.
          
                                                          18.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you please just tell her I
                    came by? Forget it. I'll catch up
                    with her on my own.
          
                                MAX
                    No.    You won't.
          
                              LUKE
                    Look, I'm gonna' see her again, -if
                    she'll see me. I don't care what
                    the fuck you say about it.
          
                              MAX
                    Oh, really?
          
          They face off.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, really.
          
                              MAX
                    You get near her, I'll feed your
                    nuts to the neighbor's dog!
          
                              LUKE
                    What kind a' dog is it?
          
                                MAX
                    Huh?
          
                              LUKE
                    I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?
          
          Caught off guard, a smile escapes Max.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I'm crazy about her.
          
                              MAX
                    Shrooms, huh?
          
          Luke nods 'yes.'
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    I'll tell her you came by.
          
          Luke nods, appreciative.
          
                                                                     19.
          
          
          
          EXT. MUDDY WATERS' MINI-MART - NIGHT
          
          A tanker truck QUAKES past. Surrounded by fir trees, the
          eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food.
          
          INSIDE MINI-MART
          
          Luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "The
          Outdoors Man."
          
          The CHIME BINGS and SYDNEY enters, early thirties, elegant in
          thrift-store chic. She's cool and in control, ...at least on
          the outside.
          
          She surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Had a sudden intense craving for a
                    cherry popsicle.
          
                              LUKE
                    You can check in that freezer.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What a relief. I'm Sydney.    You?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Luke.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Workin' late, huh?   Luke?
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, four AM. It sucks.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Sometimes you guys are just
                    unfathomably stupid.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Excuse me?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Why in the world do guys say "it
                    sucks" as if it were a bad thing?
                    I mean, every guy's dying to get a
                    blow job, right? So, you think
                    they'd treat those words with
                    profound respect, like holy
                    scripture. "What an unbelievable
                    sunset, honey: doesn't it just
                    SUCK?,"... "You won an Olympic Gold
                    Medal?!, that BLOWS!"
          
                                                                  20.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    I guess you're right.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It must be great at your age. That
                    river of testosterone coursing
                    through your veins, the damn about
                    to burst! How about we just lock
                    this place up and go for an Olympic
                    Gold?
          
                                 LUKE
                    No thanks.     Jeez, lady.
          
          Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I ought to dye my hair.      Don't you
                    think?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, I don't know.    Looks fine.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Your hair is such an incredible
                    color.
          
                              LUKE
                    It's brown.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I love it. Do you think I could
                    cut just a little piece? Match the
                    color? It really "sucks."
          
                              LUKE
                    Nah, c'mon. You're messin' with
                    me.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I'm not. I love it. You really
                    should get rid a' that thing,
                    anyway. I have clippers in my bag.
          
                              LUKE
                    What thing?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Cowlick. Right here.     See?   I can
                    just snip it off.
          
          She SNIPS his hair.    Luke pulls away.
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Hey.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What's the matter? Don't you like
                    being touched? Don't you like
                    being a guy?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. I mean,... What?      Sorry, but
                    you're just bizarre.
          
          She CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    May be. But I learned long ago,
                    you can't change your true nature,
                    even if it can change you.
          
          As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DUSK
          
          Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse
          converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm
          lights inside.
          
          Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and
          Luke's Semi.
          
          INSIDE POOL HALL
          
          Smoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls.
          
          Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables.
          
                              LUKE
                    Holy shit. It's that lady from the
                    store! Grey and black at the bar.
          
          Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon.
          
          RENTAL COUNTER
          
          Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from
          the worldly British owner, POLLY.
          
          She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease
          and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the
          bar.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
                                 POLLY
                       That boy, Keenan, still giving you
                       trouble?
          
                                 JANINE
                       Actually, I tried exactly what you
                       said.
          
                                 POLLY
                       And...?
          
                                 JANINE
                       Unbelievable! Thanks.
          
                                 POLLY
                       Works every time.
                           (to Michelle)
                       Nice to meet you, darling. I hope
                       you'll find not too many rules
                       here, and the drinks not too dear.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Yeah, thanks. It's amazing.
          
          Polly moves off.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Isn't she great? Guys drive across
                       the state just to buy a beer from
                       her. Total loner, though.    No
                       one's ever seen her with anyone.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       What did she tell you to try?
          
          Janine whispers in her ear.
          
          Michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized.
          
          They LAUGH.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Luke hands his keys to JEREMY, the handsome bartender, in
          exchange for a full pitcher of beer.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Thanks, man.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Oh, God. She's eyeing you.    I
                       think she's comin' over.
          
                                                            23.
          
          
          
          Sydney saunters up.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Can I buy you a drink?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, no thanks. We're already here
                    with dates and stuff.
          
                                SYDNEY
                    You are?    Who? Where is she?
          
                              KEENAN
                    They're around somehwere.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Luke, if you like this girl, we
                    better talk.
          
                                LUKE
                    What?
          
          Sydney glances around, talks quietly.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Anything happen since we last
                    spoke? Hot flashes? Pressure in
                    your chest?
          
          Luke pales.
          
                                LUKE
                    No.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Dr. Sydney Catchadourian.     Keenan,
                    right?
          
                              LUKE
                    You know him?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    We exchanged E-mail.    I came right
                    away.
          
          Luke gives Keenan the evil eye.
          
                              KEENAN
                    From Philadelphia?   Why?
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Your friend here has an extra
                       chromosome.
          
          The little remaining color in Luke's face now drains away.
          He shakes his head 'no.'
          
                                 LUKE
                       Someone put mushrooms in my
                       mushroom sauce.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       I tested your hair.
          
                                 LUKE
                       You're like some whack job.   Get
                       the hell away from me.
          
          Luke moves off, sloshing beer.     Sydney sighs.
          
                                  SYDNEY
                       Denial, denial, denial. Always the
                       first step. Keep him away from
                       that girl.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       What're you talkin' about?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Chromosomes. Most people have
                       forty-six: Two X if you're a girl,
                       an X and Y if you're a guy. He's
                       got forty seven: An X, a Y, and a
                       Z.
          
          POOL TABLE
          
          Janine and Michelle select pool cues.
          
                                 JANINE
                       We've only been together six
                       months. And he's such a guy's guy,
                       everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic
                       parents, six months in "Juvey."
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Wild past, huh?
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
                                 JANINE
                       I think the only reason he's even
                       alive right now, is okay, partly
                       'cause he's so damn smart, but
                       mostly 'cause there's this one
                       person, he knows, absolutely, no
                       matter what, won't bale on him.
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       You.
          
                                JANINE
                       No. He doesn't trust me at all.
                       Luke. He's a rock.
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Yeah?
          
                                 JANINE
                       So, yes, you can trust him. I'm
                       hoping Keenan's the same way.
                       'Cause believe me, I'm not used to
                       rocks, I'm used to pebbles.
          
          Michelle LAUGHS.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Grains of sand.
          
          Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back
          toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Everything okay?
          
                                  KEENAN
                       Sure.   I need a drink.
          
          Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out.
          
                                 KEENAN (CONT'D)
                           (aside to Luke)
                       That lady's nuts.
          
          Luke nods.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and
          Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a
          slight Texas drawl.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    Another round?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Please. You see that couple over
                    there? I don't get it. What's he
                    see in her?
          
                              JEREMY
                    The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd
                    give my left one to be with her.
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Yeah?   So could he.
          
          POOL TABLE - LATER
          
          Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then
          catches Michelle's admiring eyes.
          
          She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by
          the jukebox.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Your friends sorta' like each
                    other, huh?
          
                              LUKE
                    Super-glue. Thirty seconds
                    together, you can't pull 'em apart.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    How'd they meet?
          
                              LUKE
                    Keenan sold her a bike. I don't
                    think they've been apart more than
                    six hours since.
          
          Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot
          and sink the ball.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I never thought in a million years
                    you'd go out with me, let alone
                    twice.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You're not s'posed to say that.
                    That's a total pathetic, loser
                    thing to say. But I'm gonna' take
                    it as a huge compliment.
          
                                                                  27.
                                 MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, two word answers only. Why'd
                       you ask me out in the first place?
          
                                 LUKE
                       Beautiful. Unpretentious.     Why'd
                       you say 'yes?'
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Gentle.
          
          Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.
          
                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       ...Hot.   Deep.   Three words.
          
          He smiles.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Okay, two words. What're you most
                       passionate about?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Friendship. Trust.     You?
          
                                  LUKE
                       Hockey.   ...Hockey.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       So much for "deep."
          
          They LAUGH.
          
                                  LUKE
                       You.
          
          The electricity between them charges the air.
          
          Luke maneuvers himself closer.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, I'm gonna' take a wild shot.
                       Ricochet off the back, over here,
                       then straight into that side
                       pocket. What are my chances?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Point zero zero zero one.
          
          Luke takes his shot,...
          
          and KISSES HER.
          
          The ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks
          in the pocket at the side.
          
                                                                        28.
          
          
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Jeremy looks on, aroused.        Sydney squints, dismayed, barely
          able to watch.
          
                                JEREMY
                       Damn. Will you look at that tonsil
                       hockey?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       I'd prefer not. This could get
                       bad.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       You've been staring at him all
                       night. You got a thing for him, or
                       what?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Actually, I'm hoping he's got one
                       for me.
          
          POOL TABLE
          
          Keenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Looks like you two are gettin' on
                       okay. Should we rack up another
                       game?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Definitely! I'd like to get good
                       at this pool thing.
          
          Luke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue.
          
                                 MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, I'm gonna' break this wide
                       open!
          
                                    LUKE
                       Go for it!
          
          Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack,
          
          Michelle HAMMERS the cue ball.
          
          It CRACKS off the rack,
          
          ROCKETS off the table,...
          
          and CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
          Keenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP.
          
          They CRINGE, poised, waiting for Luke to react.
          
                                   MICHELLE
                       God.    Sorry.
          
          Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the
          table.
          
          He sees them watching him.
          
                                   LUKE
                       What?
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Man, I'd be on the floor cryin'
                       like a baby.
          
                                 LUKE
                       No, I'm all right.
          
          Surprised, they return to the game.
          
          Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,...
          
          with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just
          isn't right.
          
          He casually touches his hand to his pants.
          
          He pales slightly.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       Would you excuse me a sec'?
          
          He looks to Keenan for help.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the
          back.
          
          She flags Jeremy.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast!
                           (a glance at Luke)
                       Better give me the whole bottle.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          
          OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM
          
          Luke tries the men's room door, locked.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    In here.
          
          Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room.
          Luke follows, with a look of concern.
          
          INSIDE STORE ROOM
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I mean, it was like a precision-
                    guided missile.
          
          Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers.
          
          He looks down, SHUDDERS,...
          
                                 LUKE
                    Uh- ah-
          
          Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'll get some ice.
          
          Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS,
          barely able to make a sound...
          
                                 LUKE
                    It's-!     Look!
          
          Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed...
          
                                 KEENAN
                    What?
          
          then takes a look,...
          
          His EYES GET HUGE.
          
                                 KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    DUDE!!!
          
          Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I was afraid a' this!
                        (to Keenan)
                    Make sure no one gets in!
          
                                                                   31.
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                        (to Luke)
                    Now, will you listen to me?!
          
          Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.   Each time the
          horror of it grows more intense.
          
                               LUKE
                    Oh, GOD!
          
          Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a
          prescription bottle.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's gonna' come back.    Drink this!
          
                              LUKE
                    What're you givin' me?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload
                    of Darvon. You gotta' calm down.
          
                              LUKE
                    "Caaalm Down?!!!!!!"
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Here we go...
          
          He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating
          MANTRA...
          
                              LUKE
                    "CAAALM DOWN?!!!"
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's wrong with him?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He's a Zerophiliac.
          
                              KEENAN
                    A what?! I'm gettin' a doctor!
                    This isn't right!
          
          Sydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I am a doctor! You breathe one
                    word, anyone else sees him like
                    this, and he's fucked! Pictures
                    all over the net, tabloids,
                    television!
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    TELE-VISION?!!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    No!  We're gonna' get it back!
                        (to Keenan)
                    You let me help him, he gets a
                    normal body, lives a normal life.
                    Now, you his friend or not?!
          
          Keenan nods that 'yes, he is.'     Sydney releases him.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Hang onto him. So he doesn't get
                    hurt when he passes out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Now just wait a sec'?     Is it
                    CONTAGIOUS?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    There are no recorded incidents of
                    transmission from physical contact.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "Recorded incidents?!!"
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, PLEASE God!     What did I DO
                    WRONG?!
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Nothing.   You're a Z.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "RECORDED INCIDENTS?!"     Oh my God,
                    I used his deodorant!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, will you calm down?
          
                               KEENAN
                    "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!"
          
                               LUKE
                    "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!"
          
          Luke's eyes glaze over...
          
          He weaves, losing his balance...
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Finally.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
          
          Sydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.    He passes out.
          
                               SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    He'll be alright. He didn't go all
                    the way. When you fall asleep or
                    pass out, a Z almost always reverts
                    back. It's called a Nocturnal
                    Remission.
          
          Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, relax, it's not contagious.
          
          Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes
          the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.
          
          
          INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - LATE NIGHT
          
          On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment.
          
          Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.   Luke keeps one
          hand down his pants for reassurance.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    In the world?   A hundred. A
                    thousand. There's no way to know.
                    It doesn't show up in any normal
                    DNA test. It's triggered when you
                    first have sex.
          
                              LUKE
                    The woman in the RV!
          
                                 KEENAN
                        (dark)
                    From Utah.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Now, you're Morphescent whenever
                    you're aroused.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You tellin' me this is gonna'
                    happen any time he gets the hots
                    for a girl?
          
          Keenan looks over at Luke...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Man, this could be a problem.
          
                                                           34.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Is there a cure?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's not a disease!    But there are
                    steps you can take.
          
                              LUKE
                    Well, what are they?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Take it easy. You can't rush this.
                    Before anything, you need to try
                    going all the way.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "All the way?"
          
                              SYDNEY
                    You need to turn all the way into a
                    female.
          
                              LUKE
                    You out of your mind?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    You have to give it a try.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Maybe we should get a second
                    opinion.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, may be! 'Cause you can
                    FORGET THAT!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Fine, but I warn you, they've never
                    seen this before. First, they'll
                    try a barrage of antipsychotic
                    medications, surgery, electroshock
                    therapy, -god knows what.
          
                              KEENAN
                    If he were to try goin' all the
                    way, then what?
          
          Luke glares at him.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm just askin'.
          
                                                                35.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    It ain't gonna' happen!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, for Chris' sake! I'm trying to
                    help you. That Z chromosome's not
                    latent anymore! You don't get
                    control a' that thing, you don't
                    know when it's going to kick in,
                    what it's gonna' do! You want to
                    end up with three left breasts,
                    behemoth hips and one testicle?!
          
          Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect.
          
          Sydney calms herself down.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Now, there's no reason for that to
                    happen. Sorry. You're not the
                    only one who didn't get any sleep.
                    Now, are you going to let me help,
                    or not?
          
                              KEENAN
                    How would he even do that?   Go all
                    the way, I mean?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He's a Z.
                        (to Luke)
                    You become Morphescent when you get
                    turned on. You can change all the
                    way when you have an orgasm.
          
                                LUKE
                    With who?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I'm available.
          
                                LUKE
                    No way!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this
                    stage, you don't really need anyone
                    else.
          
                                LUKE
                    Huh?
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
          
          Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for
          help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Oh.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's a lot to absorb, I know. When
                    you're ready, give me a call. Your
                    first time, you shouldn't be alone.
          
          
          EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN
          
          A deserted, hilltop cemetery. Luke sits on the manicured
          lawn, across from a gravestone with vestigial images of
          brightly colored smiley-faces and fish.
          
                              LUKE
                    Michelle. And I really like her,
                    dad. But,...
          
          He bounces a soccer ball against the headstone.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    You know, I always thought your
                    dying was the worst thing that ever
                    happened to me, and that happened
                    more to you than it did to me... I
                    mean, a lot more, really.
          
          Luke paces nervously.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Look, every day I wish you were
                    around, but I swear, if I tell you
                    this, you damn well better stay
                    dead!
          
          He glances at a burial ceremony, half-mile away.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    And I swear to God I'm gonna' beat
                    this thing. No matter what it
                    takes. Before I tell you, I just
                    want to make sure you know that,
                    okay?
          
          A hushed voice...
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I think I might be a Zerophiliac.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL
          
          Keenan and Luke spar on roller blades, hockey sticks in hand.
          Luke WHACKS the hockey puck with such intensity, it may land
          on Mars.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm not doin' it. I don't care
                    what she says! I can control this
                    thing.
          
                                KEENAN
                    How?
          
                              LUKE
                    I didn't know what was goin' on
                    before. I do now, so, it's not
                    gonna' be a problem. I just need
                    to stay focused!
          
                              KEENAN
                    You mean, keep yourself from
                    getting turned on? How're you
                    gonna' do that? You get turned on
                    by two scoops of ice cream.
          
          Luke glares at him.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm just sayin'. I mean, you think
                    Larissa, the horse-faced girl's got
                    her good points.
          
          Michelle and Janine ride up on their bikes.
          
                              JANINE
                    I knew we'd find 'em here.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    We just wanted to know if you're
                    alright. After last night.
          
                                LUKE
                    Yeah.    I'm fine.   Thanks.   Perfect.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Good.
                        (slightly suggestive)
                    Good.
          
          Luke smiles, his face REDDENS.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
          
                                MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                      I had a really good.
          
                                 LUKE
                      Me too.
          
          Luke smiles, nods, followed by a look of PANIC.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                      Will you excuse me a sec'?
          
          He ducks away.
          
                                JANINE
                      What is goin' on?!
          
                                KEENAN
                      We just need to be alone.   We got
                      a big game tomorrow. Sometimes
                      guys just need to hang with the
                      guys, you know? No distractions?
          
          Janine gives him a look of "What the hell are you talkin'
          about?"
          
          Keenan stares back, PLEADING.
          
          Janine relents, despite herself.
          
                                JANINE
                      C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play
                      with their pucks.
          
          BEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER
          
          Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and
          realizes...
          
          SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
          
          Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it,
          
          Everything's normal.
          
          Or is it?
          
          He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,...
          
          He slumps back against the logs,
          
          WAVES OF RELIEF.
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
          INT. LUKE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who
          enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after.
          
                              LUKE
                    You TOLD HER?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    I had to. You know Janine.   She
                    knew somethin' was up.
          
                              JANINE
                    I've read about this kinda' thing,
                    but I didn't think it was real.
                    It's so cool!
          
                              LUKE
                    It's disgusting!
          
                              JANINE
                    How can you say that? If I had a
                    chance to be a guy for a day, I'd
                    jump at it. Seriously, Keen,
                    wouldn't you want to get inside a
                    girl's body?
          
          Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line...
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Don't EVEN go there!
                        (rolling her eyes)
                    Fine. You're boys. Still, isn't
                    it every guy's dream to have a pair
                    of boobs to play with anytime he
                    wants?
          
                              LUKE
                    Not my own!
                        (to Keenan)
                    Man, how could you tell her?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    She should be here. It's just
                    weird, two guys alone, one turnin'
                    into a girl.
          
                              JANINE
                    Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly
                    something you get to see every day.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Forget it!
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    What, HE gets to, and I don't!
          
                              LUKE
                    No one gets to!
          
          Luke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door.
          
          Keenan and Janine take up residence outside.
          
          Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door.
          
                              JANINE
                    Should we put on some soft music?
          
                              KEENAN
                    You want a magazine in there?
          
                                LUKE (O.S.)
                    Shut up!
          
          LATER
          
          Janine keeps an ear held close against the door.
          
                              KEENAN
                    How 'bout a couple beers?
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe you want to take a bath?
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Will you PLEASE shut up?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Does he sound different?
          
                                KEENAN
                    Think so.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.)
                    Oh God!
                        (lewd)
                    Oh, my God!
                        (rising in pitch)
                    Oh my GAWD!
          
          Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look.
          
                                                                   41.
          
          
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Now approaching the mirror, in awe, ...gently raising a hand
          to touch the exquisite FEMALE FACE reflected there, stands a
          real female, an absolutely FEMALE LUKE.
          
          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          
          Janine knocks.
          
                                JANINE
                    Luke?    You alright?
          
          The door opens, revealing Female Luke, wrapped in a sheet.
          
          Keenan clutches Janine.
          
          They STARE, AT A TOTAL LOSS, INCREDULOUS...
          
                                KEENAN
                    Whoa.
          
                                JANINE
                    Dude.
          
          Female Luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Happened fast, huh?
          
                              JANINE
                    Can we see?
          
          Female Luke hesitates.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Come on. It's not like I haven't
                    seen you naked a hundred times.
                    And she's a girl!
          
          Female Luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning
          naked torso.
          
                                KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.
          
                              JANINE
                    Dude.
                        (exasperated)
                    Of course they're perfect. I
                    couldn't have tits like that?
          
          Female Luke checks herself out in the mirror.
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
                                 FEMALE LUKE
                    Oh, God.     Look at me.
          
          Keenan and Janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter?
          
          Keenan, afraid to answer, looks to Janine.
          
          They both have the same reaction...
          
                              JANINE
                    You're really hot.    Victoria's
                    Secret hot.
          
                              KEENAN

                        (to Keenan)
                    Don't look at me, -it's your tape.
          
          Keenan keeps his distance from Luke, embarrassed, if turned
          on.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Look, I just wanna' get one thing
                    straight. No way I'm gonna' sleep
                    with you.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Man, even as a joke, that's just
                    SICK!
          
                              JANINE
                    I will. I'm definitely not into
                    the butch hair thing, though.   You
                    gotta' do something about that.
          
          Keenan looks at her shocked.
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    I thought you're into watchin' two
                    girls?
          
          Keenan's speechless.
          
          Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror.
          
                                                                     43.
          
          
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    This is too weird. This is
                    freaking me out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Should we call Dr. Catchadourian?
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    What for? I did it. Now, I can
                    switch back. Get outta' here.
          
                                 JANINE
                    Already?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Yeah, okay, yeah.
          
                              JANINE
                    Will you stop starin'?!
          
          Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the
          room, their eyes locked on her amazing body.
          
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch.
          
          Luca opens the door.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Janine? It's like I can't get in
                    the right mood or something.
          
                              JANINE
                    Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no
                    one could in this situation.
          
                               FEMALE LUKE
                    You gotta' help. I need to do this
                    right now!
          
                              JANINE
                    You can't force these things.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Some girls go half their lives
                    before they even have one.
          
                              JANINE
                    Okay, Studly, what do you suggest?
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          
                                 KEENAN
                       She likes it when I tell her stuff.
          
                                    JANINE
                       Like what?
          
                                 KEENAN
                       "You're so beautiful,"
                       "I love your smile,"
                       "The English Patient was my
                       favorite movie too."
          
          Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.       Female Luke
          swings the door shut.
          
          The DOORBELL CHIMES.
          
                                 FEMALE LUKE (O.S.)
                       Who's that?!
          
                                  KEENAN
                       Pizza!   Figured you'll want some
                       after.
          
          FRONT DOOR
          
          Janine throws it open, Max stands outside.
          
                                    MAX
                       Hey.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Can I help you?
          
                                 MAX
                       I was lookin' for Luke.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Hey, man. He's not around right
                       now. What's up?
          
          Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet.
          
                                    FEMALE LUKE
                       Thank God.     I'm starving!
          
          She stops in her tracks, stares at Max.
          
          Max stares back, intrigued.
          
                                 MAX
                       How ya' doin'?
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
          Female Luke nods 'okay.'
          
                                MAX (CONT'D)
                    I'm Max.    You live here too?
          
          Janine, Keenan, and Female Luke are momentarily speechless.
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   She's just visiting.
          
                              KEENAN
                    She's Luke's cousin.
          
                                JANINE
                    Luca.
          
          Keenan and Luca GLARE at Janine.
          
          Max gazes at Luca, spellbound.
          
                              MAX
                    I always thought "Luca" was a guy's
                    name? Italian or something.
          
          Luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet.
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm part Italian.
          
                              MAX
                    Cool. I'm part Italian too. The
                    important part.
                        (perfect Italian)
                    Lei sono una bella donna. Amerei
                    per mostrarlo il che inclinando
                    torre di pisa.
          
                              LUCA
                    What's that mean?
          
          His eyes fixed on Luca, he smiles.
          
                              MAX
                    You in town for a while?
          
                              JANINE
                    No, just a few weeks.
          
                                LUCA
                    'Weeks?!'
          
                                KEENAN
                    Days.
          
                                                                   46.
          
          
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm leaving today!    Now!
          
                               KEENAN
                    Is there anything you want me to
                    tell Luke?
          
          Max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated
          by Luca. He seizes on a hockey stick.
          
                              MAX
                    I'm way into hockey. I was hopin'
                    Luke could show me the ropes. Is
                    he as awesome as I've heard?
          
                                 LUCA
                    Yeah.     He's alright.
          
                              MAX
                    Do you play?
          
                              LUCA
                    Uh, I don't know.
          
                              JANINE
                    She's gotta' pack.    You need to go.
          
                              MAX
                    Really nice meeting you.
          
          Janine ushers Max out the door and shuts it on him.
          
          Luca ducks into the bedroom, shuts the door.
          
          INSIDE BEDROOM
          
          Luca at the window, peers out between the curtains, watching,
          as Max walks away.
          
          OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
          
          As Max gets to the end of the driveway, he stops and turns
          back, sporting a charming smile.
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Luca jumps away from the window, smacking into Janine.
          
                              JANINE
                    Are you okay?
          
          Luca just stares back at her, nonplussed.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    What is it? What's
                    the matter?
                        (beginning to get it)
                    Oh...
          
                                 LUCA
                    "Oh" what?     What do you mean, "oh?"
          
                              JANINE
                        (shrugs)
                    He's a hunk.
          
                              LUCA
                    I got to switch back.    Right now!
          
                              JANINE
                    What's the big deal?
          
                              LUCA
                    Get out of here!     Just GET OUT!
          
                              JANINE
                    Okay, okay.
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM
          
          Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.    He looks up
          at her, questioning.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on?
          
                              JANINE
                    It's a girl thing.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Does he need any help in there?
          
                              JANINE
                    Not from you.
          
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER
          
          Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door,
          half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY.
          
          BUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                    This is good!
          
                                                            48.
          
          
          
          Keenan and Janine PERK UP.
          
                                KEENAN
                    Finally.
          
                              JANINE
                    Alright, okay, now open those
                    little levers on the sides,... and
                    flip that center thingy back...
          
          Keenan finds this particularly unsettling.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                        (enthused)
                    Did you get this thing at the mall?
          
                                JANINE
                    No.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Janine wouldn't have one a' those.
          
                              JANINE
                    Please. And mine's got way more
                    features than that one.
                        (Keenan's crotch)
                    Or that one.
          
          Keenan gives her the evil eye.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                    So, where'd you get it?
          
                              JANINE
                    It was Larissa's.    My roommate.
          
          Inside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS.
          
                                LUCA (O.S.)
                    GROSSS!!!
          
          OUTSIDE DOOR
          
          Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'm just sayin', he's not that
                    experienced with girls.
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, and you are?
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'm startin' to wonder if you are?
          
                              JANINE
                    I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.
          
          Keenan flips the TV remote, disturbed.
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated.
          
                                JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Luca?
          
                              LUCA
                    Don't call me that!
          
                              JANINE (O.S.)
                    You gotta' just think about
                    whatever turns you on. No matter
                    what it is.
          
          Luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out
          momentarily, then draws back.
          
          OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Janine lies down on the floor.
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                        (last ditch)
                    Okay, pretend you're thrown on your
                    back, pinned against the bed...
          
          Spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs...
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    You can't move an arm, a leg,
                    nothing, even an inch!
          
          Keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone...
          
                               JANINE (CONT'D)
                    And two strong hands feel your
                    thighs,...
          
          Keenan watches, getting turned on...
          
                               JANINE (CONT'D)
                    creeping firmly, slowly toward your
                    breasts...
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
          Keenan lunges for Janine.
          
                                JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Keen!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Babe, every time I look at you, I
                    get the shivers! I just want to
                    rip your clothes off, and throw you
                    down...
          
                                JANINE
                    Oh, Keen!
          
          They're kissing, ROLLING AROUND TOGETHER now,...
          
                              KEENAN
                    I want to envelop every inch of
                    you, that incredible curve along
                    your side,...
          
          They roll on the floor, clothes torn...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I want to pin your arms over your
                    head, and make mad, passionate...
          
                                LUCA (O.S.)
                    AAAHHH!
          
          Keenan and Janine RECOIL.
          
          Whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound.
          
          The door opens.
          
          Luke stands in his shorts, ALL MALE.
          
                              JANINE
                    You're a screamer.
          
          
          EXT. LANGFORD STATUARY SUPPLY - NIGHT
          
          Sydney makes her way through a barbed-wire fence, past a "No
          Trespassing" sign. A lone DOG HOWLS in the distance.
          
          Life-size replicas of Greek Gods, Venus and David, all face
          one way in the mist. Their cold stone bodies press up
          against each other; nude, indifferent.
          
          A figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat,
          a baseball cap over his eyes: Luke.
          
                                                           51.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What are we doing here?
          
                              LUKE
                    Didn't want anyone around.   So, I
                    did what you said.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Amazing, huh?
          
                               LUKE
                    Weird.   Awful.
          
                             SYDNEY
                    Hmm. Was it difficult making the
                    switch?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. It was hard gettin' back.      I
                    need an owner's manual.
          
          Sydney smiles, nods in agreement.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    A lot of guys could use one of
                    those.
          
                               LUKE
                    So, what now? Do I take pills or
                    something?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    No, it doesn't work like that.
                    This may sound odd, but I need to
                    know if you're attracted to me.
          
                                   LUKE
                    What?    No.
          
                                SYDNEY
                    Hmm.    You're not gay, are you?
          
                              LUKE
                    NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted
                    to you like that.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Okay, calm down. This could be a
                    problem. Right now, you can go
                    either way anytime you want. It's
                    a very special and critical time
                    for a Z, something you'll
                    experience only once in life.
          
                                                52.
          
          
          
                      LUKE
          Good.
          
                    SYDNEY
          You need to use this incredible
          opportunity you've been given, to
          figure out which you're supposed to
          be: male or female.
          
                      LUKE
          What?
          
                    SYDNEY
          Don't you see? You get to choose.
          
                    LUKE
          I don't want to choose.   I want to
          be a guy.
          
                    SYDNEY
          Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes
          your desires can conflict with your
          desires. It's important to know
          for sure.
          
                    LUKE
          Believe me, I know.
          
                    SYDNEY
          I think you need to try again.
          
                      LUKE
          No way!
          
                    SYDNEY
          Why're you so resistant? If the
          truth is, you want to be a guy,
          great, but if not...
          
                    LUKE
          Don't even say that!
          
                    SYDNEY
          Well, clearly some part of you
          feels differently. You couldn't
          change if you didn't want to.
          
                      LUKE
          What?!    That's crap!
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    That's the thing about the truth.
                    It'll set you free, but first it
                    can really piss you off.
          
          Sydney moves to leave.
          
                              LUKE
                    This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a
                    guy!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Then what's the problem?   You are
                    one.
          
          Sydney turns to leave.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're not gonna' help?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I will, the moment you're ready to
                    try again. You can come back to my
                    place right now if you want.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Forget it!
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL - DAY
          
          Bikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.    Abandoned timber
          surrounds an asphalt clearing.
          
          Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a
          friendly, if brutal roller hockey game.
          
          Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs,
          cheering them on.
          
          Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY
          to score the winning GOAL.
          
          The Guys CHEER.
          
                              CHAD
                    Well, ain't we a basket a'
                    biscuits?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Yeah, Luke, what got into you
                    today?
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                                    LUKE
                    The Force.
          
          AFTER THE GAME
          
          The guys gather up their belongings near the cars.
          
          Luke sits on the running board of his truck, unlacing his
          skates.
          
          Max comes over.
          
                                MAX
                    Hey.    Good game.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Yeah.
          
                              MAX
                    I dropped by your place. Any chance
                    you could give me a few pointers.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Me?
          
                              MAX
                    You're awesome out there. And
                    according to my sister, you walk on
                    water.
          
          Luke grunts, a smile.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    Truth is, I uh, met your cousin.
                    Luca.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Oh.     Yeah?
          
                              MAX
                    You both have practically the same
                    name?
          
                              LUKE
                    We were both named after our Uncle.
                    Locasto.
          
                              MAX
                    Well, she's cool. Actually, she's
                    hot. I was hopin' maybe you could
                    hook me up.
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
          
                                 LUKE
                    Huh?   No.    Not a chance.
          
                                 MAX
                    Boyfriend?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! She just wouldn't be
                    interested!
          
                              MAX
                    She a Lesbian?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! Of course not.     Jesus!   She's,
                    -my cousin!
          
                              MAX
                    Yeah, okay. So? Michelle's my
                    sister. You gonna' tell me you
                    wouldn't like to do her?!
          
                              LUKE
                    FUCK YOU, man!
          
          Luke SHOVES Max, who SHOVES him right back.
          
                              MAX
                    What is your deal?!
          
                              LUKE
                    You ASSHOLE!
          
          Luke lunges for him.
          
          They go at it, wrestling FIERCELY.
          
          Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground.
          
          Luke surges with RAGE, breaks free. Grit teeth, ripped
          clothes, they roll on top of each other, two rabid pitbulls.
          
          Keenan and the Other Guys rush in, pulling them apart.
          
                              MAX
                    Keep the fuck away from me!     And
                    Michelle too!
          
                              LUKE
                    You can fuck off!
          
                              CHAD
                    What the hell's goin' on?!
          
                                                                      56.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                        (to the guys)
                    Luke's datin' his sister.
          
                              VARIOUS GUYS
                        (recognition)
                    Aaaah!
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, you can all fuck off!
          
          Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off.
          
          
          INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN
          
          Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with
          Jeremy.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This shirt? I've had it for years.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Well, it's very sexy. I love men's
                    clothes. What else have you got in
                    your closet?
          
          Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches,
          her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Polly, are you alright?   Didn't
                    mean to walk in on you.
          
                             POLLY
                    Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love,
                    tears. That's the trade-off.
          
          She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks
          behind the bar.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    My God, he's gorgeous.
          
                              POLLY
                    Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the
                    sweetest boy in the world. Sorry,
                    darling, I'm afraid you'll find
                    he's not your type.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, we'll see about that.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
                              POLLY
                    I think he may prefer men.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I certainly hope so.
          
          Keenan and Janine enter.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    You two better have a seat.
          
                              JANINE
                    Is Luke alright?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He should have full control over
                    this now. Something must be really
                    confusing him. The only thing I
                    can think of...
          
                               KEENAN
                    What?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    When he became Luca, was he
                    attracted to one of you? You can
                    get really thrown by that. Janine?
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   Not me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Well, he sure as hell wasn't
                    attracted to me.
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   Definitely not.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Wasn't it just the two of you?
          
                              JANINE
                    Not exactly.
          
          Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, give me a break! No way!
                    Max?! They just had a huge fight.
                    He tried to beat the crap out of
                    him!
          
          Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look.
          
                                                         58.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!   He
                    was just turnin' into a girl!
          
                               JANINE
                    Exactly.   He was a girl.
          
                               KEENAN
                    Oh!   This is just wrong.
          
                              JANINE
                    Would you rather she was attracted
                    to me?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Would you?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe I would!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke
                    needs your help. He needs to know
                    you're behind him, no matter what
                    he wants.
          
          Janine nods.
          
                              JANINE
                    So, what's all this mean?
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Bottom line? Maybe Luca really
                    likes this boy, -enough to want to
                    be female.
          
                              JANINE
                        (to Keenan)
                    Don't sneer!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, come on! I know the guy.
                    We've done all kinds a' shit
                    together: Hoops, hockey!
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, and girls can't play sports?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine!
                    Why the hell would he want to be a
                    girl?!
          
                                                                   59.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    That's so hard to imagine?!
          
                                 KEENAN
                    Uh, -YEAH!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I'm
                    talking about. You see this?
          
          Sydney pulls out a SNAPSHOT, shows it to Janine.
          
                                 JANINE
                    Who's he?     An Ex?   ...Oh, my God.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Ex me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're one too?
                    You're a Z?
                    You're a guy?!
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Was.   I made a terrible mistake.
          
          She and Keenan keep staring at the photo...
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    And once you finally figure out who
                    you are, it's a horrible thing not
                    being yourself. That's why it's
                    crucial we help Luke.
          
          Janine nods, grasping the significance.
          
          Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You musta' worked out.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPUS - OUTSIDE DORM
          
          Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory.
          
          Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow.
          Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike.
          
                              LUKE
                    What's this all about?
          
          Janine hands him the box.
          
                                                                      60.
          
          
          
          Keenan sneers, cringes.
          
                              JANINE
                    It's just a little something we
                    thought you might want.
          
          Luke opens it, pulls out a BLUE DRESS.
          
                              LUKE
                    What the hell is this for?
          
                              KEENAN
                        (elated)
                    I told her.
                        (to Janine)
                    I told ya'. What a stupid ass
                    idea!
          
                              JANINE
                    Keen! Don't! We just want you to
                    know, whatever you decide, it's all
                    right with us.
          
                              LUKE
                    Decide?! WHAT?! No, it's not!
                    Get this thing away from me! JUDAS
                    PRIEST!
          
          Luke HURLS the box out to the curb.    Keenan gives him a
          thumbs up!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Sorry, man. Think she wishes
                    everyone was female.
          
                              JANINE
                    What's that s'posed to mean?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he
                    doesn't want to be girl!   Like
                    he'd have to think about THAT!
          
                              JANINE
                    There happen to be millions of us
                    out there that like being female!
          
                              LUKE
                    Well, bully for YOU!
          
          Janine walks over to pick up the box.
          
                                                          61.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    NO! I want to know! Just exactly
                    what's wrong with being a girl?!
          
                               LUKE
                    Nothin'! It's great!    It's
                    fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen
                    to BE one!
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe we should've had this
                    conversation the other afternoon?!
          
                              LUKE
                    That wasn't my choice!
          
                              JANINE
                    I sure as hell didn't make you do
                    it!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Janine, will you just let me talk
                    to him for a sec'?
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!'
                    Give me a fuckin' break!
          
          Janine storms off with the box.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Sorry, man. She talked me into it.
                    You know Janine.
          
          Keenan picks up his bike, gets on.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Look, uh,... you do like bein' a
                    dude, right?
          
                               LUKE
                    Asshole!
          
          Keenan GRINS, rides off.
          
                              KEENAN
                        (calling back)
                    You should thank me.    The one she
                    picked out was PINK!
          
                                                                    62.
          
          
          
          UP THE WALKWAY
          
          Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box
          mangled inside.
          
          Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the
          dress out, brushes off some dirt.
          
          He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it.
          
          
          INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
          
          Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves.
          
          The CHIME BINGS.
          
          He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight.
          
          Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Hi.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Hey.     How are you?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    I'm okay.     You?
          
          As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer.
          
          Luke maneuvers to keep his distance.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Okay.     You look really nice.
          
                                MICHELLE
                    Thanks.    I was hopin' you might
                    call.
          
                              LUKE
                    I was going to.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's something I need to talk to
                    you about. -But did I do something
                    wrong?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. Nothin' like that. There's
                    just some stuff I've got to sort
                    out.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Like what?
          
          They gaze at each other across the magazine rack,
          
          a mountain range of silence between them,...
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    There's nothing you can't tell me.
          
                              LUKE
                    Me too. What did you want to talk
                    to me about?
          
          They stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Nothing really.   So, heard you and
                    Max really got into it?
          
                               LUKE
                    Yeah.   I kind a' lost it.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    He knows how to push buttons, huh?
                    What exactly did he say that got
                    you so pissed off?
          
                              LUKE
                    I don't know. We'd just finished a
                    game. I was all revved up.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    He's actually a really nice guy.
          
                              LUKE
                    Not sure he's too crazy about me
                    seein' his sister.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Did he scare you off?
          
                              LUKE
                    No, he doesn't "scare" me. What,
                    his struttin' around, thinkin' he's
                    such a bad ass, with his shirt
                    hangin' open half the time?
          
          Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words.
          
          Michelle steps away, confused.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       It's just an act. He likes
                       pretending he's Joe Cool. Always
                       says you gotta' just be whatever
                       you want, and fuck 'em if they
                       can't take a joke.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Well, he's a joke alright.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Look, I'm not sure this is gonna'
                       work out.
          
                                 LUKE
                       I'm sorry, I didn't mean-
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       No. I can't do this. I'm not sure
                       you even know who you are. Much
                       less who I am. Have you ever even
                       had a girlfriend?
          
                                 LUKE
                       What's that supposed to mean?!
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Well, if you think my brother's
                       such a "joke," how much better
                       could you think of me? We're not
                       that different, you know?
          
                                 LUKE
                       You're totally different.    He's a
                       guy, for one.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       And he's my best friend. If you
                       don't like him, you can't like me.
          
          She exits.
          
          MINI-MART - LATER
          
          Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted,
          fidgety, distressed.
          
          He glances up at the magazine rack. A Female Fitness
          magazine catches his attention. The BEAUTIFUL COVER model
          seems to MOVE.
          
          He stares at it: no movement.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          
          Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover.
          
          As he steps away, he glances back at the rack,
          
          CELEBRITY MAGAZINE COVER
          
          The ADONIS on the cover comes to life. He rips off his shirt
          as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he
          passionately kisses the BIKINI-CLAD COVER MODEL.
          
          MAGAZINE RACK
          
          THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping
          down, moving to other magazines and making out with each
          other all across the rack.
          
          OUTSIDE THE MINI-MART
          
          The windows glow among the dark trees.
          
          Inside, Luke rips up covers, HURLING magazine after magazine
          across the floor.
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          INSIDE BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
          
          Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray
          of water, upset.
          
          Steam rises, filling the bathroom.
          
          She begins SINGING, longingly,...
          
                              MICHELLE
                    "I wanna know how to go
                    To the inside of love.
                    I can't find my way through."
          
          
          Washing herself,
          
          behind the shower curtain,
          
          the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts.
          
          As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes...
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    "I'm outside of love,
                    To the side or above,
                    I can't find my way with you"
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          
          A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows
          more muscular,
          
          and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,...
          
          as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX.
          
                              MAX
                    "Must be a special view,
                    Finding a me with a you,
                    On the inside of love."
          
          Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror.
          
          
          INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT
          
          A persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over
          a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She
          swings the door open.
          
          Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Oh, honey.     Come in.
          
          BY THE FIREPLACE
          
          Sydney pours hot tea.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're one too.    Why didn't you
                    tell me?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I didn't want to confuse the issue.
          
                              LUKE
                    So, it's true what you said? You
                    really know. I wouldn't change
                    unless I wanted to?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Maybe some part of you.
          
                               LUKE
                    What part?    How much of me? I
                    mean, for it to work? Half? More
                    than half? What if it was only a
                    tiny bit, -a thought?
          
                                                          67.
          
          
          
                               SYDNEY
                    I don't know. But I believe there
                    may be thousands of Z's out there,
                    millions for all we know, go their
                    whole lives without even knowing
                    they are one. Nothing ever
                    happens. You couldn't keep it from
                    happening.
          
                              LUKE
                    I love being with Michelle. How
                    come I can't control it when she's
                    around?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I think whatever part of yourself
                    you deny, just gets bigger and
                    bigger until it takes you over.
          
          Luke nods sadly.
          
                              LUKE
                    You think I don't really want to be
                    a man.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I think for some, making it stop is
                    more important than knowing who you
                    are. It was for me.
          
                              LUKE
                    Maybe for me too.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Right now, you're Morphescent. The
                    key is to have sex with another Z.
                    You become Adulmorphic. Your
                    gender locks. You can't just
                    change anytime you want.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Another Z?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    That's why I came all the way out
                    here.
          
                              LUKE
                    And why you keep tryin' to get me
                    in the sack?
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Thought maybe I could save you some
                    distress. But you say you're not
                    attracted to me. For it to work,
                    both of us have to be into it.
          
                              LUKE
                    That won't be a problem.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Okay then.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Tonight.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Not right now? Okay.   Tonight.
          
          
          EXT CEMETERY - MORNING
          
          Morning dew. Acres of empty grass.   Luke sits at the top of
          a hill by his dad's grave.
          
                              LUKE
                    Remember that Christmas when Keen
                    and me accidentally set the
                    Scofields' house on fire?
          
          He stares up at the sky.
          
                               LUKE (CONT'D)
                    And that burning shingle drifted
                    over and lit up the Robertson's
                    place? The whole town was ready to
                    lynch us, and we snuck back home...
                    Two AM, you were up drinkin'
                    coffee,...
          
          He tugs out hunks of grass.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I thought you were gonna' kill us.
                    But you just looked me right in the
                    eye, and said, "Son, there's
                    leftover pizza in the fridge."
          
          A tear rims his eye.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    That was the coolest thing anyone
                    ever said. Dad, I'm in such
                    trouble.
          
                                                                     69.
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I feel like if I let this thing in,
                    it's all over. But I don't know
                    what else to do. Guess you can't
                    figure out who you are, until you
                    accept who you might be.
          
          
          INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - DAY
          
          Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across
          the bed.
          
          Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror.   A man's
          gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie.
          
          
          INT. LUMBER MILL - DAY
          
          The giant work floor of the abandoned mill.   Sunlight beams
          through holes in the roof.
          
          Max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck
          along the floor.
          
          He stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside
          the giant metal doors:
          
          Luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in
          hand.
          
                              MAX
                    You're about the last person I
                    expected to see.
          
                              LUCA
                    I can show you a few moves if you
                    want?
          
                               MAX
                    Yeah?   What the hell.
          
          LATER
          
          Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey
          puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber,
          and sawdust piles.
          
          All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck.
          
          Max finally gets it, which riles Luca. She hip checks Max.
          They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each
          other on a sawdust pile.
          
          They bust out LAUGHING.
          
                                                                      70.
          
          
          
                               LUCA
                    Not bad.
          
                              MAX
                    You're better than Luke.
          
                              LUCA
                    I taught him everything he knows.
          
          Luca pulls away from Max, suddenly self-conscious that Max's
          leg is on top of hers.
          
          Awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue
          sky through a hole in the roof.
          
                              MAX
                    I thought you left town?
          
                              LUCA
                    Had to come back.
          
                               MAX
                    Good.
          
                              LUCA
                    Where'd you learn to speak Italian?
          
                              MAX
                    Just tourist stuff. "I'll have the
                    spaghetti bolognese." "How much
                    for a room?"
          
                              LUCA
                    Have you been?
          
                              MAX
                    Little Italy. In New York.
                    Someday, though. Want to go with
                    me?
          
          Max leans over and KISSES Luca.   She responds, tentatively at
          first,
          
          then as she grows more confident,...
          
          her face REDDENS, she GASPS.
          
          Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.    She brushes
          sawdust off her dress, stands.
          
                              LUCA
                    Look, this was a mistake.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
                               MAX
                    Yeah.   Of course.   I know.
          
          Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the
          floor, incredulous.
          
          Keenan exits out through the giant doors.
          
                              LUCA
                    Oh, Jesus...
          
                              MAX
                    Are you and he...?
          
                               LUCA
                    Huh?
          
                              MAX
                    It's really none of my business.
          
                               LUCA
                    No! I'm sorry.    I shouldn't've
                    come here.
          
          Max stands, brushes off the sawdust.
          
                              MAX
                    Please don't say you're "just
                    visiting." That you "need to
                    leave." I'm the one who needs to
                    leave.
          
          Max skates off across the giant shop floor.
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL - DUSK
          The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt.
          From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled
          down window.
          
          ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
          
          Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists
          open another beer, which he gulps.
          
          AT THE TRUCK
          
          Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats
          and a T-shirt.
          
          Keenan sits on the running board.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?!
                    You do wanna' be a girl? You're
                    into guys now?
          
                             LUKE
                    No! I don't know exactly.    I don't
                    know.
          
          Keenan downs his beer, pensive.   He crushes the can and hurls
          it, SMACKING a garbage can.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What about Michelle?
          
                              LUKE
                    I had to be sure. I am now. Come
                    on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I
                    make out with a girl, I start
                    turning into one. You gotta'
                    admit, it's a little weird, isn't
                    it?
          
          Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan
          stands.

                    Let's get outta' here.  You want a
                    ride somewhere? Janine's?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Why don't you go see her?   Think
                    you're more her type.
          
          Keenan picks up his bike.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll see ya' round, okay?
          
                              LUKE
                    "See me around?"
          
          Keenan shrugs.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Look, I'm gonna' find my own place,
                    okay?   This is gettin' too fuckin'
                    weird for me.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm goin' to Dr. Catchadourian's
                    tonight. To make this stop.
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I don't care. I've had it with all
                    this crap. I mean, you gonna'
                    start hittin' on me next?
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, that's right Keenan, you and
                    me: let's do it.
          
          Keenan rides off, leaving Luke shell-shocked.
          
          
          INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT
          
          Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown.
          
          Small Greek statues now adorn the room.
          
                              LUKE
                    I guess I really did need to face
                    it head on in order to see.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It was courageous.
          
                              LUKE
                    Girls, are just, I don't know.
                    It's a different energy. They're
                    soft and warm, they can make a guy
                    feel complete.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    And multiple o's. Actually, male
                    Z's have multiple o's too. Been so
                    long I nearly forgot.
          
                              LUKE
                    Cool.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Okay, to be honest, I'm relieved
                    you sorted this out. My conscience
                    would have bothered me for decades
                    if we'd just gone ahead without you
                    being certain.
          
          Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of
          champagne. A toast.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    To womanhood!
          
                                                             74.
          
          
          
                                 LUKE
                       To manhood!
          
          They drink.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       So, how does this work?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       We just do it. And, ...it just
                       happens.
          
          AT THE BED
          
          Luke and Sydney begin undressing.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Do you like this dress?
          
                                 LUKE
                       Sure. Looks great on you. Man,
                       dresses! Even without everything
                       else, dresses are reason enough
                       right there to stay a guy.
          
          Sydney takes this in, considers,...
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       "Stay a guy?"   Let me get this
                       straight. You didn't decide to be
                       a woman?
          
                                  LUKE
                       No.   Of course not.   What?
          
          Sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: Plan B.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Just testing you. Hold on a
                       moment. There's something I
                       forgot...
          
          She retrieves some ROPE.
          
                                 LUKE
                       What's that for?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       You've never done it with another
                       Z. Trust me, you need to be tied
                       down.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Does it hurt?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    On the contrary.
          
          BEDSIDE TABLE - LATER
          
          The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in
          the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF
          SCREEN...
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    Just let yourself go completely.
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Wow, this is intense.
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    When two Z's do it, the lateral
                    hypothalamus gets completely
                    overwhelmed,...
          
                                LUKE (O.S.)
                    OH, MAN!!
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    Cellular fission kicks in, and,
                    well,... you can go Zytusional!
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Unbelievable!
          
          The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly
          stare.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Oh no.   What's happening?
          
          Luke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH...
          
                               HALF-LUCA (O.S.)
                    What have you done?!
                        (Luca)
                    NOOOOO!!!!
          
          The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE,
          
          culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard,
          
          SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX...
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
          
                               LUCA/LUKE AND SYDNEY (O.S.)
                     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          
          Silence.
          
          MIRROR - LATER
          
          A great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears
          in reflection: MALE SYDNEY.
          
          Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in
          her mouth.
          
          Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in
          the mirror.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY
                         (into phone)
                     I hear you're the best. Yes, it's
                     an emergency!   Please. Or I'll
                     have to cut it myself.
                         (to Luca)
                     Now, you look me in the eye, and
                     tell me that wasn't the best sex
                     you ever had.
          
          Luca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY!
          
                               MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                         (into phone)
                     Half an hour! YES! THANK you!
          
          Male Sydney clicks the phone off.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                     You can have all my clothes. Oh,
                     and I just bought these incredible
                     Anna Felucci pumps.
                         (reconsiders)
                     Maybe I should keep those.
          
          Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray
          Italian tux.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                     Okay, I wasn't completely honest
                     with you, but I never lied either.
                     It stopped. That is what you
                     wanted.    You're Adulmorphic now.
                     The only way to switch is to do it
                     with another Z.
          
                                                                     77.
          
          
          
          He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.   He sits on the bed,
          speaks softly.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    I know you don't believe me, but
                    this is the right thing for you.
                    Eventually, you'll figure that on
                    your own. But I could tell it was
                    just gonna' take way too long!
          
          Luca stares, distraught.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Chris' sake. Being a woman
                    doesn't make you any less of a man!
          
          The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles.
          
          Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger...
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Damnit! I can't live my whole LIFE
                    wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake!
                    I'm a man! I love havin' this
                    chest, these arms! But most of
                    all,...
                        (grabs his pant crotch)
                    Welcome home, boys! Hang in there,
                    I'm takin' you out for a SPIN!
          
          LATER
          
          Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed.
          
          A KNOCK at the door.
          
          Luca MOANS and tries to YELL through her gagged mouth.
          
          The KNOCK PERSISTS.
          
          SIDE WINDOW
          
          The ivy parts and Keenan peers in.
          
          His eyes GO WIDE.
          
          He pushes the window open a little, whispers...
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on? Where is she?
          
          Luca MOANS and struggles against the ropes.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Whoa. I guess I really didn't
                    think you were gonna' go this way.
                    Okay. Whatever.
          
          Keenan sits on the edge of the bed.
          
          Luca MOANS trying to get Keenan to remove the gag.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Hang on a sec'. Look, I'm sorry
                    about earlier, -what I said. But
                    all this stuff.   Janine and I
                    split up.
          
          Luca stops struggling, shocked.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    All I ever did was piss her off.
                    I'm not sure she even wants a guy.
                    And you think I'm so much better
                    with girls than you, and sure I can
                    get laid anytime I want, but truth
                    is, I never even woulda' hit on her
                    if it weren't for watchin' you.
          
          Keenan climbs on top of Luca, starts untying her hands,
          straddling her.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    The way you just talk to 'em about
                    anything, like it was okay. I
                    gotta' get her back, man.
          
          With Herculean effort, Keenan struggles to hold back tears...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    It's like the whole world's blown
                    apart. Ah, shit. Man, you havin'
                    tits now is just weird.
          
          
          EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY
          
          The truck THUNDERS along through the trees, head lamps
          BLAZING, dashboard lights bright.
          
          Keenan's at the wheel.
          
                              LUCA
                    Janine said he's definitely there.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Did she mention me?
          
          Luca indicates 'no.'
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Women. God, I'm glad you want to
                    be a guy. You are absolutely sure,
                    right?
          
                                 LUCA
                    Yes!
          
                              KEENAN
                    'Cause it really is totally cool
                    either way.
          
                                 LUCA
                    I'm SURE.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Okay, I just don't want you to
                    think I'm zerophobic, or somethin'.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - NIGHT
          
          Students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall.
          
          Male Sydney spots his prey, and approaches Jeremy, who hangs
          out alone on the grass near a small bonfire.
          
          The firelight licks their faces.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    You're on the wrestling team.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Yeah.   You catch the meets?
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    Just an educated guess.    Wanna'
                    wrestle?
          
          Jeremy LAUGHS, glances around, unsure what to make of him.
          
          
          INSIDE THE SEMI
          The truck CAREENS around a CURVE.
          
                              LUCA
                    Can't this thing go any faster?!
          
                                                                 80.
          
          
          
          Luca considers...
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    You know me better than anyone.
                    What do you think?
          
                                KEENAN
                    Huh?
          
                              LUCA
                    I mean, if I weren't a hundred
                    percent sure which I'm s'posed to
                    be. If you had to say.
          
                              KEENAN
                    All I know is, every time you look
                    at Michelle, or think about her,
                    you smile. What the hell else do
                    you need to know?
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not right. She deserves to be
                    with a normal guy.
          
                              KEENAN
                    So, you don't get to be with
                    anyone?
          
          They drive in silence.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    That why they call it "zero-
                    philia?"
          
                              LUCA
                    She's not gonna' want some guy who
                    thinks maybe he's supposed to be a
                    girl sometimes.
          
                              KEENAN
                    How do you know? Did you ask?
          
                              LUCA
                    No way I'm gonna' ask her that.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Well, you have to.   Where are your
                    nads, man?!
          
          Luca glares at him.   Keenan realizes his mistake...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    We'll get 'em back.
          
                                                                        81.
          
          
          
          The truck ROARS on.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S
          
          As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       Come on, let's grab a couple beers.
          
          Sydney tugs at his T-shirt.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                       Of course, I see you brought your
                       own six-pack.
          
          
          GRAVEL PARKING LOT
          
          Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the
          crowd.
          
          Janine waves to Luca and points across the way.
          
          Luca nods.
          
                                   LUCA
                       Let's go!
          
                                   KEENAN
                       Jeez.    She won't even look at me.
          
          They stride across the field.
          
          BEHIND THE BARN
          
          Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       I do love to mess with Texas.
          
          Keenan and Luca appear around the corner.
          
                                   LUCA
                       There!
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       We better get outta' here.
          
          Keenan reaches them first.      He wrenches Male Sydney and
          Jeremy apart.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                                JEREMY
                    Keenan?!    It's not the way it
                    looks.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don't
                    care if you're queer. Trust me,
                    around here, that's nothin'!
          
          Luca catches up and TACKLES Male Sydney, throttling him on
          the ground.
          
                              LUCA
                    You son-of-a-bitch!       We're doin' it
                    again, right now!
          
                               JEREMY
                    Jeez.   She your wife?!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    No!  She just said, she wants sex!
                        (to Luca)
                    I can't. I'm sorry.
          
                                 LUCA
                    "Sorry?!"     Fuck you!    FUCK ME!
                    NOW!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    It won't work.
          
                              LUCA
                    We're goin' inside right here!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    I'll scream rape.
          
                                 LUCA
                    So will I.
          
          They pull Male Sydney toward the barn door.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    But I'm gay!
          
                                 LUCA
                    So what?
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    We both need to be into it, or
                    nothing happens.
          
                                                           83.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Such bullshit.
          
          Jeremy moves off, wide-eyed and disturbed.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    That's why I became a woman in the
                    first place. I couldn't handle it.
                    Figured if I was female, it was
                    okay to like guys.
          
                              KEENAN
                    She's lyin'.
          
          Male Sydney shakes his head 'no.'
          
                              LUCA
                    You're tellin' me, 'cause you're
                    straight as a girl and I'm straight
                    as a guy, we can screw and switch,
                    but...
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    'cause you're straight as a girl,
                    and I'm gay as a guy, even if we do
                    it...
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm just screwed.
          
          Keenan's confused...
          
                              KEENAN
                    Jeez. You need trigonometry to
                    figure this thing out. Maybe
                    you're 'bi.'
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    In my world the Kinsey scale's
                    three-dimensional, but trust me,
                    girls do nothing for me. Zilch!
                        (to Keenan)
                    You, on the other hand...
          
          Keenan RECOILS.
          
                              LUCA
                    What am I gonna' do?
          
                              KEENAN
                    What if he's lying?    I say, do him
                    again anyway!
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
                                LUCA
                    Fine!
          
                               MALE SYDNEY
                    Fine.   Waste of time.
          
          Luca notices Michelle standing nearby.
          
                                LUCA
                    Michelle.
          
                                KEENAN
                    Oh, man.
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not what you think.
          
          Keenan and Luca realize that she's Luca right now, not Luke.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What does she think?
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You asshole!
          
          Michelle moves off.
          
          ALONGSIDE THE BARN
          
          Luca runs up.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I don't believe this.    You slept
                    with that guy?!
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not what you think.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, please! What about Max?
          
                              LUCA
                    What about him?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Don't you care about him at all?!
          
                              LUCA
                    Not like that: I'm straight!   I'm
                    attracted to you!
          
                                                          85.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, who cares, you idiot! And
                    sorry to break it to you, but I'm
                    straight too.
          
                              LUCA
                    No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm
                    not who you think I am-
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who
                    you are!
          
          Luca stares, stunned.
          
                              LUCA
                    You know I'm a Zerophiliac?!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Yes! So you can just go fuck
                    yourself. -Literally!
          
                              LUCA
                    Does Max know who I am?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    What if he does? Do you?
          
                              LUCA
                    He's a guy!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    And you're a girl!
          
                               LUCA
                    I'm not!
          
          Michelle gestures "Oh really?!"
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    I'm not supposed to be!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's no supposed to be anything,
                    you just ARE!
          
                              LUCA
                    Is that what you think?!   NO!
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Well, then congratulations! You're
                    a guy, just like every other guy I
                    ever met! I can't believe you
                    slept with him!
          
                              LUCA
                    He was a woman! I was tricked.   I
                    didn't know I'd switch.
          
          Michelle stares, incredulous.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You're gonna' tell me he's a Z
                    too?! Both of you?!
          
                              LUCA
                    Yes!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Well, that's just perfect. What,
                    is there something in the water
                    around here?!
          
                              LUCA
                    She told me it would make it stop.
                    That it would keep me from turning
                    into a girl.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    So what?! Why's that so important
                    to you?! There's no way this was
                    gonna' work.
          
                              LUCA
                    Because I'm a Zerophiliac.
          
                               MICHELLE
                    Because you can't stand being one!
                    Bye, Luca.
          
                              LUCA
                        (correcting her)
                    Luke.
          
          She glances back, sad and angry.
          
          Luca watches her go, distraught, and then RUNS...
          
          ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE
          
          Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's.
          
                                                                   87.
          
          
          
          Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind. They sit
          nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say.
          
          Luca gazes up at the moon.
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    What's it like? To really make
                    love?
          
          They all three gaze up at the moon.
          
          Keenan steals a glance at Janine.
          
                              KEENAN
                    The best part's just lyin' there
                    after. Really close, really far
                    away.
          
                              JANINE
                    Like goin' to the moon, maybe.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Yeah. ...They should open a pizza
                    joint up there.
          
          Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces.
          
                              LUCA
                    What am I gonna' do?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Maybe being a woman'll turn out
                    okay. Like being an elevated
                    member of the male species.
          
                              JANINE
                    Elevated "member?"
          
                              KEENAN
                    I just mean, maybe he'll learn to
                    like it.
          
                              JANINE
                        (sarcastic, to Keenan)
                    As hard as that is to conceive!
          
                              LUCA
                    Shut up! Both of you! What, you
                    want a written guarantee? You're
                    so damn lucky! You're into him,
                    he's into you. Super-glue! What
                    the hell else do you need to know?
          
                                                                  88.
          
          
          
          Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...
          
                                 KEENAN
                       I think you're the female half of
                       me.
          
                                 JANINE
                       I think you're the macho half of
                       me.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                 LUCA
                       And I don't know what half of who
                       the hell I am.
          
          They look to Luca surprised,...
          
          then all three bust out LAUGHING.
          
                                 JANINE
                       What are you gonna' do?
          
                                 LUCA
                       I don't know. I prefer being a
                       guy, but I'm a girl? I'm attracted
                       to Max, but I'm in love with
                       Michelle? It's like I'm s'posed to
                       be both.
          
          Her own admission surprises her.
          
                                 LUCA (CONT'D)
                       Not too practical. But at least
                       now I know.
          
          She almost laughs, sad, but relieved.
          
          
          INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - LATE NIGHT
          
          The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind
          the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool.
          
                                 POLLY
                       Girl trouble? Boy trouble?
          
          Max shrugs.
          
                                 POLLY (CONT'D)
                       How about we get a game in before
                       dawn?
          
                                                         89.
          
          
          
          Max nods, sets up a new rack.
          
                              MAX
                    What's the point? It never works
                    out. Or they just cheat on you
                    anyway.
          
                              POLLY
                    Liverpool was a veritable shagfest
                    when I was your age. A boulevard
                    of broken hearts. But eventually,
                    I found him.
          
          She sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket.
          
                               POLLY (CONT'D)
                    Scratch.   Then he died.
          
                               MAX
                    Sorry.
          
                              POLLY
                    Everything reminded me of him. So,
                    I came here, half way round the
                    world to forget. Then created this
                    place, just like the one where we
                    met.
          
                              MAX
                    He can't handle this. Us.   He
                    can't handle who he is.
          
                              POLLY
                    You being a guy too?
          
                              MAX
                    Or him being a girl.
          
          Polly's confused, but presses on.
          
                              POLLY
                    Everyone's terrified. But once you
                    really know someone, and they know
                    you, it makes you whole.
          
                              MAX
                    No one wants to know who I really
                    am.
          
                              POLLY
                    You're so sure?
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    It's impossible. He was the one
                    person I thought could understand.
                    But no, it's impossible.
          
          Max puts the cue stick down, and moves off.    Polly calls
          after,...
          
                              POLLY
                    It's worth finding out.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Max slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he
          hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.
          
                                LUCA
                    Hey.
          
                                MAX
                    Hey.
          
                              LUCA
                    I know she doesn't want to talk to
                    me. But do you know where I can
                    find her?
          
                                MAX
                    New York.     Left two days ago.
          
                                LUCA
                    Oh, man.    ...You're staying?
          
                              MAX
                    Just 'til Friday.
          
          Max returns to his work.
          
                              LUCA
                    I wanted to apologize to her.
                    Forget it, I don't know,...
                    Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be
                    with me and her, but I just wish
                    she knew how much I, -and that I
                    wasn't cheating, I was just trying
                    to be a man for her.
                        (laughs)
                    She'd have a field day with that
                    one, huh?
          
                                MAX
                    True.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          
                              LUCA
                    If you talk to her, please just
                    tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her
                    the best,... everything.
          
                                 MAX
                    Thanks.
          
          Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response.
          
                                 LUCA
                    I'm sorry.     To you too.
          
                                 MAX
                    For what?
          
                              LUCA
                    Mixed signals, I guess.
          
          Max walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing.
          
                               MAX
                    Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch!
          
                              LUCA
                    You all right?
          
                              MAX
                    Stepped on a nail.    Damn it!
          
          Max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    So, you gettin' used to this at
                    all?
          
                                 LUCA
                    I wish.
          
                              MAX
                    You definitely had me confused.
          
                              LUCA
                    For whatever it's worth.     I think
                    you're a pretty hot guy.
          
                               MAX
                    Thanks.   But you're not interested?
          
                              LUCA
                    Truth is, I am. And I guess it
                    sounds crazy, but I couldn't do
                    that to Michelle.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
          Luca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock.
          
                               MAX
                     For whatever it's worth, I think
                     you're pretty hot too.
          
                                  LUCA
                     Thanks.
          
                               MAX
                     Too bad you're a moron.
          
                                  LUCA
                     Excuse me?
          
                               MAX
                     I have incontrovertible proof.
          
          Luca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the TATTOO
          OF A GREEN BIRD.
          
          Max meets her eyes,
          
          and it finally dawns on Luca,
          
          standing, in shock, and now putting it all together,
          
          she LUNGES for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him.
          
          She RIPS Max's T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking
          over oil cans.
          
          Passion.   Unbridled.
          
          IN THE PARTS YARD
          
          Luca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge
          tires, as Max's face transforms...
          
          BY OLD RADIATORS
          
          Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. She pulls Luca
          toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke.
          
          BY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS
          
          Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing,
          
          TRANSFORMING as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and
          Luke and Luca -or was that Max?
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
          INT. MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - DAWN
          
          White gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. The sun's
          first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows.
          
          Michelle stirs slowly, then BOLTS AWAKE.       She grabs Luke, a
          vise grip around his torso.
          
          He awakens, groggy.
          
                                   LUKE
                       Hey you.    ...Good morning.   What's
                       up?
          
          Michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.
          
                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                       You still think I'm going to bolt,
                       don't you?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       And leave me stuck.
          
          He smiles.
          
                                 LUKE
                       What do you want, a gender pre-nup?
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Maybe.   I have to go to work.
          
          She nuzzles him playfully.      Luke glances at the clock, MOANS.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Only place I'm going is back to
                       sleep.
          
                                MICHELLE
                       No. I can't show up at work like
                       this.
          
                                   LUKE
                       Oh, yeah.
          
          He smiles, folds into her.
          
          FADE OUT
