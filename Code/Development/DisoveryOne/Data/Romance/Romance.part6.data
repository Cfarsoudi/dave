     FADE IN:


1   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY                1    
    A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara
    coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays           
    Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.      


2   CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS                              2
    The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND        
    JAKE.

    JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."

    The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
    glass of champagne.                                                
                         JAKE
               Happy happy happy...

                         JANE
                   (reminding him)
               -- Anniversary.

    Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.

                         JAKE
               Some things never change.

                            SALLY
               Thank God.

                         JANE
               I thought maybe you were drifting.

                         TED
               He was pausing.

                         JAKE
               Exactly....
                   (sighs, raising his glass)
               Happy... Anniversary. You two have
               led an extraordinarily blessed
               life.

                    JAKE(cont'd)
          As long as I've known you both,
          you've always managed to somehow do
          everything entirely right.

                    JANE
          -- That's so true.

                    JAKE
          But, honestly, how can it be thirty
          years!?!   When did we do that trip
          to Spain?
              (looks to Jane)
          It was for both of our what..?

                    JANE
          -- Fifteenth anniversaries.

                    JAKE
          God, that was a great trip...

The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21    
YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
puts his arm around his Mom.

                    JANE
          Ollie, how was graduation?

                    OLIVER
          It was fantastic. I can't believe
          I'm not in school anymore. When's
          Luke's graduation?

                       JAKE
          Next week.

                    JANE
              (correcting him)
          It's in three days!

                     JAKE
          Sorry!   I mean this week.

                    TED
          Are the girls going?

                    JANE
          They can't wait.                                      
Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE           
SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over    
a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries    
a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and          
uncomfortable.
                                                      3.



                    OLIVER
          How long is Luke home before he has
          to go back for work?

                    JANE
          -- Only a week...                                
                    SALLY                                  
          Aw, that's it?                                   
                    JANE
          I know, I hate it. Well...
              (Agness joins the group,                     
               standing next to Jake)                      
          Congrats again...
              (puts down her champagne)
          Great party...

                    OLIVER
          You're leaving?

                    JANE
          Yeah, I have some
              (Agness hands Jake a piece
               of cake. Jane works hard
               at not appearing
               flustered)
          -- stuff I have to get done tonight
          for work...
              (to Jake & Agness)
          I'll see you two in New York.

                    AGNESS
          Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.

                      JANE
          Good.    Well....

                    AGNESS
          -- Jane, what are you wearing to                 
          the graduation?

                    JANE
          Oh, a suit or dress, probably a
          suit.

                      AGNESS
          Fancy.    Okay.

Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
                                                        4.



                    JAKE
          See you there, Janey.    Where are
          you staying again?

                    JANE
          We're at The Park Regent. You said                 
          you were at The Four Seasons,                      
          right?

                    JAKE
          I don't know.
              (to Agness)
          Where are we?

                    AGNESS
          We're at The Park Regent too.                      
                       JANE
              (hates    this)
          Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient,
          actually.     Okay, so, see you soon..             
              (waves    awkwardly)

                    SALLY
          -- I'll walk you out.

As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:

                    AGNESS
          So, Ted, do you think you can help
          us get Pedro into El Montecito for
          kindergarten?

ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE

                    SALLY
              (laughs)
          I thought it was sweet how well you
          and Jake were getting along. Felt
          like old times.

                    JANE
          Yeah, well, we know how to do this
          by now. It has been ten years.                     
                    SALLY
          That's crazy.

Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness         
affectionately rubbing Jake's back.                          
                                                              5.




    ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

    as it closes after Jane.


    ON JAKE - AS HE TURNS BACK

    and sees Jane is gone.

                                                      CUT TO:


3   TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY                                   3    
    in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA
    MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child.       
    But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered
    from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your
    mother. We are:


    EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

    The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in
    the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of
    vegetables dot the landscape.

    Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER         
    SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
    trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        
    has an air of maturity about her.

                        LAUREN
              Gabby, stop...you're never going to                      
              fit all this in... you can come                          
              back for the rest tomorrow.

                        GABBY                                          
              I can't come back t---

    Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt        
    and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down
    the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.                
                        GABBY                                          
              Oh, God...that's all my clothes.

                        HARLEY
                  (sets the suitcase down as
                   he sees an SUV heading to
                   the house)
                        (MORE)
                                                           6.
                    HARLEY(cont'd)
          Okay, your Mom is home. She'll                        
          figure this out.

The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling    
cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.          
                    JANE
          Gabby, you're leaving now? I                          
          thought you were going in the
          morning?

                    GABBY                                       
          I know but my friends are all there
          and they wanted me to come tonight.

                    JANE
          But honey, it's gonna get dark
          soon. You can't see out the back
          window. It's Saturday night.
          People will be on the road
          drinking...

                    LAUREN
          Mom, she'll be there in a couple of
          hours, she'll be fine.

                    GABBY                                       
          Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.
          I'll be back for it in a few days.

                    JANE
          Want me to drive it down in the
          morning?
              (Gabby's BLACKBERRY                               
               BUZZES, she laughs,                              
               thumbs flying)                                   
          I could be there by lunch. We could
          go to that big Bed, Bath, and
          Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby,                   
          can you look up from that thing??

                    GABBY                                       
              (looking up)
          I got it covered, Ma.
              (to Harley)
          Hey gangsta, help me carry these...

                    HARLEY
              (exhausted)
          Yep....

Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.   Jane    
seems worried as she watches them.                              
                                                             7.



                    LAUREN
          Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the                     
          house alone?

                    JANE
          What are you....? No!
              (Lauren looks doubtful)
          -- I'm not! One of you is always                        
          moving out...                                           
              (Gabby re-joins)                                    
          But I am wondering who I'm gonna
          watch The Hills with?


                    GABBY                                         
              (huge hug)
          Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.

Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard.         
Harley joins the group.                                           
                    GABBY                                         
          Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing
          this.
              (walks to her car)
          Mom, you don't happen to know where
          Dad is, do you? I tried calling
          him to say goodbye...

                    JANE
          He was at Sally and Ted's.

                    HARLEY                                        
          He was? How was that? You and
          them at the same --                                     
              (Jane turns to him)                                 
          -- not that it's in any way, any of                     
          my... was just...                                       
                    JANE
          -- It was....                                           
              (notices both girls wait
               for her answer)
          -- whatever. It was fine.

                    GABBY                                         
          Was her lunatic child there?

                    JANE
              (laughs)
          Not this time. Gabby, call me when                      
          you get there. Do NOT forget.

                        JANE(cont'd)
                  (Gabby texts, deep in                                    
                   convo )
              Gabby!                                                       
                        GABBY                                              
              I will. I'll call you!                                       
                        LAUREN
              Knock `em dead, little one.

                        HARLEY
              And call us when you get there,
              too. And no texting and driving.

    Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and            
    starts off.

                        HARLEY
                  (puts his arm around
                   Jane's shoulder)
              They grow up so friggin' fast. I
              hate it.                                                     
    Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.                      
                        LAUREN
              Maybe you should get a dog.

                           JANE
              Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love
              you.

                        HARLEY
                  (heading for their car and
                   getting into the
                   passenger seat)
              Love you boss!

    As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her
    suddenly very empty nest.


4   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                    4
    A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
    Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
    her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!


5   INT. KITCHEN                                                      5
    Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a       
    few glasses and plates on the island.
                                                              9.


    Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she          
    suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,            
    allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of      
    it.                                                                


7   INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7    
    This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
    BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
    Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au          
    chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
    in.

    A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
    between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and           
    friendly.

    Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
    the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
    powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
    through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.

                        JANE
              Reynaldo...
                  (nods to the muffins)

                        REYNALDO
              Too much sugar.

                        JANE
              Little bit.                                              
    Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.                          
    Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
    Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
    coffee with lids.

                        JANE
              Who wants coffee while they're
              waiting?

    Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.

    JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

    refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.               
                        JANE
                  (quietly to a Young                                  
                   Employee)
              Check on table five, will you?                           
                                                             10.



    The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on         
    the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos         
    when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.       
                        JANE
                  (all smiles)                                         
              Peter!

    PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam        
    is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's                
    something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
    holds rolled blueprints.

                        PETER
              Jane, I can't remember, have you                         
              ever met Adam Schaeffer?                                 
                JANE                             ADAM
    No.                             Yes.


                        ADAM
              Well....                                                 
                  (shrugs awkwardly )                                  
                        PETER                                          
              Look what we've got.                                     
                        ADAM                                           
                  (raises the blueprints)
              Your plans.                                              
                        JANE
                  (to Peter)
              So excited!


8   INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY             8
    A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
    posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
    few reviews.

    Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
    the blueprints in front of Jane.

                        JANE
                  (before she looks)
              I've been thinking about this
              addition for ten years.                                  

    Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
                                                          11.



                    JANE
          Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
          like this wall of windows, Peter.

                    PETER
          That was Adam actually.

                      JANE
          Oh.
              (still perusing, then to
               Peter)
          Love where you put the stairs.
          That's so good!

                    PETER
          Adam's idea...

Did she hear that?

                    JANE
          Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -                      
          I have a real kitchen with four                        
          walls... It's...oh, wow...you                          
          actually understood what I wanted!

Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation.   Peter looks    
to Adam.

                      PETER                                      
          All Adam.                                              
Jane turns to Adam.                                              
                    ADAM
          I'm happy you like it.

                    JANE
              (finally noticing him)                             
          Okay. Hi.                                              
              (shakes his hand)

                    ADAM
              (laughs)
          Hello.

                    JANE
          You read all my e-mails.

                    ADAM
          All 47 of them.                                        
                                                            12.



Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the          
door.

                    OFFICE MANAGER
          Jane, it's 10:15.

                     JANE
          It is?
              (rises)
          Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...
          dentist. Can you leave these and
          I'll make a few notes? Well,
          actually, I have one tiny note now.
              (to Adam, re: plan)
          In my bathroom...um...no his and
          her sinks.

                    ADAM
          Okay, sure. No his?

                       JANE
          Just hers.

                    ADAM
          And you don't think in the future
          you might want a his?

                    JANE
          Oh, God, we're talking code about
          my life, right?

                    ADAM
              (laughs)
          No, no, didn't mean to be.

                    JANE
          The truth is, in my current                             
          bathroom, I have two sinks and                          
          sometimes the other sink makes me
          feel bad.

                    ADAM
          One sink. Not a problem. Can we
          schedule a meeting for next week?
          Does Tuesday work for you?                              
                    JANE
          Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too                       
          early? At the house?

                    ADAM
          I'll be there.
                                                             13.




9   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                              9
    Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
    a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
    The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR
    ENTERS.

                         JANE
              Hi.

                        DOCTOR
              Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.

                        JANE
                  (shaking his hand)
              Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
              to start with... and please don't
              take this the wrong way but I'm the
              type of person who kind of makes
              fun of people who get plastic
              surgery.

                        DR. MOSS
              I understand.

                        JANE
              You do? Good, because, you know,
              some women can look a little fake                        
              and plasticky. And in my opinion --
              worse.

                         DR. MOSS
              I agree.

                        JANE
              Oh, that's good, so, well, as
              against the whole thing as I am, I
              do have a problem that's been
              bugging me. My left eyelid is
              really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
              holding it up when I'm watching TV
              or reading and I was wondering if
              that's something you could fix.

                        DR. MOSS
                  (looking at her closely)
              It's resting on your eye lashes.                         
                         JANE
              Is it?
                                                              14.



                         DR. MOSS
                   (measures her lids with a
                    very tiny ruler)
               Actually you have the same amount
               of excess skin on both sides.

                         JANE
               I do? Well, I'm only interested in
               fixing one eye.                                       
                         DR. MOSS
               Jane, what you need to fix this is
               a brow lift.

                         JANE
               A brow lift? Wh-what is that
               exactly?

                           DR. MOSS
               We surgically cut at your hair
               line. Incision goes right across                      
               here.                                                 
                   (demonstrates on himself
                     by indicating a line
                     drawn like a headband)
               Then we just lift the skin up a
               little tighter across the skull.
                   (Jane nods, already hating
                     this)
               We staple it back in place right
               above your ears. Recovery isn't
               all that bad but you could be
               fairly numb and you'll probably                       
               have a headache that lasts anywhere
               from say 3 to 6 months.


10   INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING                               10
     Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
     nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves
     down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
     hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
     Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.

     Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
     back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY          
     dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
     his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black     
     dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously      
     mid-argument.
                                                         15.



Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
when they realize Jane is in the elevator.

                     AGNESS
          Jane!

                     JANE
          -- Hey..                                               
                     JAKE
          Hiii.

                     JANE
          Hello.

                    AGNESS
              (pushing the Lobby button,
               mumbles)
          -- Perfect.

                    PEDRO
          Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.

                    JAKE
          Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
          someone.

Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
elevator.

                    AGNESS
          Pedro, up! Now!!                                       
              (she snaps)

Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.

                    JAKE
          What are you doing in this
          building?

                     JANE
          Dentist.

                    JAKE
          You don't go to Sharon anymore?

                    JANE
          Uh, no... changed.

Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
back. It creeps her out.
                                                              16.


     Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
     Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up      
     his back.                                                       
                         JAKE
               Honey, don't do that..

11   As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up
                                                               11    
     to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS       
     and as she answers it --

                         JANE
               -- See you in the Big Apple.                          
     Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.                            
                         JAKE
                   (trying to be nonchalant                          
                    with a kid on his head,                          
                    smiles)                                          
               See you there.


12   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN/DINING AREA - THAT NIGHT              12
     Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is
     flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never
     been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They
     are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.

                         TRISHA
               That is beyond....

                         JANE
                   (laughing)
               -- When the three of them got in                      
               the elevator... between that and                      
               the staples and the headache for
               six months... it was the most                         
               insane hour of my life.

                         DIANE
               -- Jake has lost his mind.

                         JANE
               Oh, I don't know...

                         DIANE
               I know. First of all, he was a
               complete prick for cheating on you.

                         JANE
               Well, can't disagree with that.
                                       17.



          DIANE
And then he marries her... a known
lunatic.

          JANE
She has a big job.

          TRISHA
Why do you always say that?

          JANE
Because she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY,
whatever that station's called so
she's not that big of a lunatic.

          DIANE
Janey, come on, he cheats on you
with her, your 20 year marriage
ends then six months later she
leaves Jake for some random guy,
has a baby, leaves that guy,
marries Jake and she's not nuts?

          JANE
    (groans)
Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.

          JOANNE
Oh, thanks.

          JANE
No, I mean, you never have to bump
into him.

          JOANNE
That's true.

          TRISHA
    (rises to get more wine)
Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
on Match.com that I didn't like?

          JANE
Gee, what a great offer.   I don't
think so.

          TRISHA
He wasn't that awful.

          JANE
Oooo. Sounding better every minute.
                                                         18.



Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.

                    TRISHA
          You know it's not healthy not to
          have sex for...however long it's                     
          been...                                              
                    JANE
          Trust me... I'm not not doing it on
          purpose.

                    DIANE
          Okay. I don't know if this is true,                  
          but I read on line about this woman
          who hadn't done it in so long her
          vagina closed up.

                      JANE
          What!!!    Get out of here.

All the Women SCREAM.

                    DIANE
          I swear to God. It grew back
          together.

                    JOANNE
          Wait. Was it ever one piece?

                    DIANE
          All I know is, she had to have a
          vaginaplasty.

                      TRISHA                                   
          Ouch!!!!                                             
                    JANE
          Oh my Goddddddd.

 Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head.     
                    JANE
              (lifts her head, then
               talks as if she's in the
               doctor's office)
          "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little
          situation that needs fixing...."

                    TRISHA
          Bubbee, you want to fix your
          situation? Just date someone.
          Seriously. Anyone.                                   
                                                                19.



      As Jane takes that in, we:                                          
                                                          CUT TO:         




16    EXT. THE PARK REGENT HOTEL - NYC - DAY                        16    
      CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and        
      Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their              
      luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward
      them.

      Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his            
      hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she        
      sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek,           
      then another tight squeeze.

                           JANE
                Love when we're all in the same
                time zone.


A17   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER                A17       
      They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.         
                          HARLEY
                So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide                   
                to have the party?

                            LUKE
                Oh, yeah.    Big time.                                    
                          JANE
                What party?

                          LUKE
                Are you guys gonna sleep over?

                          LAUREN
                If you give us your bed and change
                the sheets.

      They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK.

                          JANE
                You're having a party? When?
                    (to Reception Clerk)
                Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully
                next to each other.
                                                 20.



                    RECEPTION CLERK
          I have an Adler, J. in a Superior
          Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm             
          sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two
          Standard Doubles. Sorry about                
          that.

                     JANE
          Yeah, we're not the ones in the
          Superior Suite. Have the other               
          Adlers checked in yet? Just
          wondering.

                    RECEPTION CLERK
          No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet.            
          Now I just need a credit card and            
          your signature.

As Jane takes out her credit card...

                    LUKE
          -- Mom, is it okay if the girls
          come with me now and help me set
          up?

                    HARLEY
          And by girls he means the three of
          us.

                    JANE
          Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have
          reservations for all of us for
          dinner. That's not happening now?

                    LUKE
          I don't know. Me and my friends
          are having this huge thing at our
          apartment and the girls said they'd
          help us set up..
              (sees her disappointment)
          We're going to be together all day
          tomorrow.

                    GABBY                              
          -- Mom, it's his last night before
          graduation.

                     JANE
          Okay, okay.    Do you want me to
          help or...
                                                             21.



                         LUKE
                   (super sweetly)
               -- Love your credit card....


17   INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER                      17     
     Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and
     carry ons as well as her own. Just as the doors are about to
     close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on.
     As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's
     waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at
     each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.


18   INT. JANE'S ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER                      18     
     Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully
     dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open.


20   INT. HOTEL BAR AND RESTAURANT - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT        20     
     Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant.                    
                         JANE
                   (to Host)                                         
               Hi. Adler. One.

                         HOST
               Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs.
               Adler. Would you like to wait at
               the bar?

                         JANE
                   (trying to read upside
                    down reservation list)
               Sure. You don't happen to have
               another Adler coming in, do you?
               Adler for two?

                         HOST                                        
                   (perusing)
               No... You're our only Adler this
               evening.

                         JANE
                   (relieved)
               Thanks.

     ANGLE - THE BAR                                                 
     Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women.                
                                                         22.



                    JANE
              (to Bartender)
          Pinot Noir, please. No, you know                      
          what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini                   
          very dry with a twist.                                
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being    
in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and         
HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.

                    JANE
          Where's your....??

Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next
to Jane.

                    JAKE
          Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm
          flying solo.

                    JANE
          Really? Didn't know you knew how
          to be by yourself.

                    JAKE
          Any chance you could just go easy
          on me? Just a one night free pass.
              (noticing her)
          You look good, Janey.

                       JANE
          Yeah....                                              
                    JAKE
          You do. You always do.   Your
          hair's shorter.                                       
                       JANE
          Longer.                                               
                       JAKE
          I like it.

The Host joins them.                                            
                    HOST
          Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.

                    JAKE
          Want some company, Mrs. Adler?
                                                             23.



     Jane gives Jake a doubtful look.

                         JAKE
               -- We both have to eat.
                   (sees Jane is hesitating)                          
               When's the last time we ate a meal
               together?

                         JANE
                   (thinks for a sec)                                 
               Just the two of us? Alone?      1999.                  
                         JAKE
               So, come on. Once every ten years.

21   A HALF HOUR LATER                                          21
     New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're         
     sitting as close as they've been in a decade.                    
                         JANE
               So...how are things in the
               fertility world?

                         JAKE
                   (checks watch)
               I can't believe it took you this
               long to bring that up.

                         JANE
                   (trying not to laugh)
               Sperm issues?

                         JAKE
               Apparently. Yes.

                         JANE
               A baby?! Really Jake? So...the
               next time you go to a graduation,
               you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus...
                   (tries to do the math)

                         JAKE
               -- I think the number you're
               looking for is 79.

                            JANE
               Okay.     So. Seriously, how is that
               good?

                         JAKE
               Why are we talking about this? I
               thought we were going to have fun.
                                                                 24.



                          JANE
                Where'd you get that idea?

22    A BOTTLE OF WINE IS OPENED                                  22
      and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are           
      sitting a little closer together.                                 
                          JAKE
                -- Just tell me, how long were you
                seeing him for?

                          JANE
                Oh, please, it was five years ago.

                          JAKE
                I know but I always wondered so...

                          JANE
                Little jealous?

                            JAKE
                Yes.

                          JANE
                The man's married now.

                          JAKE
                I don't care. How long?

                          JANE
                Eight months.

                          JAKE
                    (surprised)
                Long....

                            JANE
                Not long.

A23   LATER                                                      A23
      The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but      
      still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she         
      can't stop laughing.                                              

23    OMIT                                                        23    


24    BRANDY TIME                                                 24
      A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the       
      dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song.                
                                                             25.



                         JAKE                                        
               This song reminds me of your                          
               birthday party... the one in our                      
               old house...                                          
                         JANE                                        
               -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun                      
               night.                                                
                         JAKE                                        
               So fun. You wore that white halter                    
               dress....                                             
                         JANE                                        
                   (remembering)                                     
               Oh, yeahhhh....                                       
                   (remembering it all, looks                        
                    at Jake with a longing                           
                    for her own past...)                             
                         JAKE                                        
               Want to dance?                                        
                           JANE                                      
               -- No...!                                             




25   THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          25
     Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush
     of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing.
     Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her.
     Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one
     another without inhibition. A mating dance....

                         JANE
                   (astonished, laughing)
               You're married to someone else...!

                         JAKE
               Tell me about it!

     They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close.                     
                         JANE
                   (sexy....)
               Hey.... I know you.
                                                                 26.



                         JAKE
                   (looking deeply into her)
               And I know you....

                                                       CUT TO:          


26   INT. JAKE'S SUITE - LATER                                    26
     They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even
     entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing
     heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a
     solid pat and hold.

                         JAKE
               Home sweet home.

                         JANE
               Oh......God.........

     Jane covers her face.

                         JAKE
               That was one crazy ride...thought
               we were going to break the bed.

                         JANE
                   (not looking good)
               -- I'm having an out of body
               experience.

                         JAKE
               Totally. You're so great, Janey. I
               forgot how great. Holy shit.

                         JANE
               Please shut up.    I'm so dizzy.

                         JAKE
               And the pilates are payin' off by
               the way.

     Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and
     throws up into it.

                           JAKE
               Oh no!

     Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to
     Jake. Jake looks over at her.                                      
                           JAKE
               You okay?
                                                                  27.



                         JANE
                   (starting to rise)                                    
               Look the other way.

                         JAKE
               Why?

                         JANE
               `Cause I have to get up.

                         JAKE
               Jane...I know what you...

                         JANE
               Look the other way Jake!!!

     As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a
     pillow covering her bare ass. Jake hears her throw up again.
     He winces.


27   INT. BATHROOM                                                 27
     Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out.
     Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing
     boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.

                         JANE
                   (looking up at him)
               WHAT is wrong with us?

                         JAKE
               What do you mean? This was
               amazing. We just had a great time.

                         JANE
               A great time? This is the dumbest
               thing two people have ever done.                          
                   (giant moan.... )                                     
     Jake sits on the edge of the tub.    This is news to him.

                          JAKE
               Really? I don't know.... I haven't                        
               thought it out, but off the top of
               my head I'd say it was smokin' hot                        
               so something about it wasn't so
               dumb.
                   (she stares up at him,
                     sick as a dog)
               And, FYI, I like that you stopped
               getting bikini waxes. You've gone
               native. I was into it.
                                                              28.



     Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up
     again.


28   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NYU GRADUATION DAY             28
     The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating
     Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the
     families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding.

29   ANGLE - THE ADLERS                                           29
     Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her
     are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and                
     screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
     the video camera, wiping away tears.

     ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
     a broad bow.

     The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
     whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
     girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
     ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
     at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane             
     turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.


30   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY - NYC                                  30
     The Family celebrates over lunch. Luke is telling a funny
     story about something that happened on stage at graduation.
     Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing. She
     can't seem to move beyond what happened last night.

                         LAUREN
                   (sotto)
               You okay?

                          JANE
               Yeah.   Totally.

     UNDER THE TABLE

     Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and
     under her skirt.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's
     story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or
     I'll kill you."
                                                     29.



                    JAKE
          I would like to propose a toast to
          your Mother.

                    JANE
              (what???)
          To me?

                    JAKE
          I've done my part with you guys,
          but Jane... you -- very talented
          you...

                       GABBY                               
          Oh, God...

                    JAKE
          Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did                
          a magnificent job, as you always
          do...

The Kids look at one another...what's this about?

                    JAKE
          When I look at the three of you
          beautiful kids...all grown up, I
          think of all the work your mother
          did, much of it without my help...
              (starts to well up)

                    LUKE
          Dude...pull it together.

                    JAKE
          -- Janey, I take my hat off to you.

                    JANE
          Okay, Jake. Thank you.
          Out of nowhere, sudden
          appreciation. But thank you.
          Really.

                    JAKE
          Not totally out of nowhere,
          Jane...if you know what I mean.

                    JANE
              (quickly)
          Which I don't...but...

                    LAUREN
          What's he...?
                                                                30.



                         JANE
               -- Have no idea. Let's move on,                          
               shall we?                                                
     Jane holds up her droopy left eye.

                         GABBY                                          
               I'd like to say something too. For
               real. No offense to the lovely
               Agness or her charming offspring...
                   (the Kids stifle laughs)

                         JAKE
               -- Not nice.

     Harley stops laughing.

                         GABBY                                          
               I know. I'm sorry. But I just want
               to say I really loved today, just
               being with the original five...
                   (Luke nods in agreement)
               -- plus Harley, but he's like one
               of us. I don't think we've ever
               done this before... Had a meal
               together. And hung out like
               this...

                         LAUREN
               You mean other than the first 13
               years of your life.

                         LUKE
               I know what's she saying. It's been
               awesome....just for a whole day to
               be just... us.

     They all reflect on that one.


31   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - LATER                          31     
     The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next
     to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids
     chat behind them.

                         JAKE
                   (to Jane)
               Something feels right in the
               universe again, doesn't it?

     Jane looks at him but doesn't answer.    She turns to the Kids.
                                                         31.



                    JANE
          So who's coming home when?   No
          one's told me the details.

Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation.

                       JAKE
                 (into cell)
          Hey.
              (turns away)
          How's Pedro feeling?

Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren.

                    LAUREN
              (responding to "Pedro")
          Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke
          up, the three of us leave day after
          tomorrow and Luke's home the end of
          the week.

                     JAKE
              (rejoins, finishing his
               call)
          -- I will. Call you when I land.                     
              (slips cell away, not
               missing a beat)
          Janey, what flight are you on?

                    JANE
          I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.                     
                    JAKE
          Ah, too bad. I'm on the five                         
          o'clock.

                    LUKE
          That's nuts, why don't you try to
          get on the same flight?

                    JAKE
          Yeah, I could try.

                    JANE
          It's been...great, but let's not
          ... push it.

                    LAUREN
          He was just trying to be nice.

                    JANE
          I know. Okay, I've got to hit the                    
          road, guys.

                         JANE(cont'd)
                   (kisses each kid as they
                    line up)
               Thanks for staying. So proud of
               you. Be good. Call me if you need
               me.                                                     
                   (she arrives at Jake,
                    pauses, speechless)

                         JAKE
                   (kisses her cheek)
               It was really fun.

                         JANE
                   (painfully)
               It was.

ADAM'S POV - JANE

jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod.

                    ADAM
          Jane!

She doesn't hear him. Adam backs up next to her. Jane slows
down. Adam lowers the passenger window. She looks in,
doesn't recognize him at first.

                    ADAM
          It's Adam...                                            
                    JANE
          It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!

                    ADAM
          Are we still okay?

                    JANE
          Yes! Totally forgot! I'm so
          sorry! Can you give me a lift back
          to the house?

                    ADAM
              (quickly cleaning up the
               front seat)
          Sure...come on in.

Jane GETS INTO THE CAR just in time to hear:

                    MALE NARRATOR (V.O.)
          -- But perhaps the most important
          lesson in going through your
          divorce is to learn to forgive.
          Forgiveness is the key to--

Adam hits the CD KNOB to turn the CD OFF, but instead he
accidentally FAST FORWARDS.

                    MALE NARRATOR (V.O.)
          In spite of your hurt feelings,
          prove to her that you can be a
          mature--

Adam HITS THE KNOB again and this time, turns it OFF, a bit
mortified.

                    JANE
          Just getting a divorce?
                                                               34.



                          ADAM
               Yeah.
                   (then)
               Two and a half years ago.

                          JANE
               Wooo.

                         ADAM
                   (embarrassed)
               It's been a process.

                         JANE
               Here's the good news. In two more
               years you'll actually begin to feel
               normal again.

                         ADAM
               In two more years I'll begin to
               feel normal? Why am I having
               trouble seeing that as good news?

                         JANE
               Maybe that was just my experience.

                         ADAM
               Oh God, I hope so.                                      


35   EXT. HOUSE - LATER                                         35
     Blue prints are spread on a garden table.   Adam is drawing as    
     Jane watches.                                                     
                         ADAM
               -- So if we move this wall back a                       
               bit, that can bring the arch                            
               forward, which is where you really                      
               want it, right?                                         
                         JANE
               Yes, I'd love that.

                         ADAM
                   (sketching)
               Thought so.

                         JANE
               I have an idea... what if we move                       
               my bedroom like six or eight feet                       
               so I can get more of the morning                        
               light?                                                  
                         (MORE)
                                                         35.
                    JANE(cont'd)
              (sees Adam hesitate)
          Not possible?

                    ADAM
          -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the                     
          morning, open your bedroom door and
          fall 12 feet into your kitchen.

                   JANE
          Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up
          there!

                    ADAM
          But I get where you're headed.                        
          Let me see what I can do... This                      
          property is so great... Have you                      
          lived here a long time?

                    JANE
          About ten years. I bought this                        
          place right after my divorce but                      
          it's taken me until now to be able                    
          to finally do this....                                
Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up    
and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.

                    JAKE
          Good morning!
              (to Jane)
          Am I interrupting...?

                    JANE
              (thrown that   he's here)
          Hi. No, well, we   were just about                    
          done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband,                  
          Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer,                 
          my architect.

                    JAKE
          Hi.

                    ADAM
              (they shake hands)
          Good to meet you.

                    JAKE
              (re: plans)
          Can I take a look?   Do you mind?

Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already
looking.
                                                                 36.



                         JANE
               Everything's not 100% worked out
               yet...

                         JAKE
               Wow. You're finally getting the
               kitchen you always wanted...                             
                         JANE
               Yeah...

                         JAKE
               Huge bedroom.                                            
                         JANE
               It's not huge.                                           
                   (suddenly insecure)
               Why don't I show these to you when
               we get a little closer.

     Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little.
     Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.

                         ADAM
               So, I think next we should stake
               out the addition... see how it all                       
               feels - size wise...                                     
                         JANE
               Sounds great.                                            
                         ADAM
               I'll e-mail you and we'll set it                         
               up. We did good work today. Jake,                        
               nice meeting you.

     Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.           
                          JAKE
                   (turns to Jane)
               Got time for a cup of coffee?

     Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them.   Jane waves, a     
     bit embarrassed.


36   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                          36
     Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge,
     taking out juice...
                                                37.



                    JAKE                              
          Why haven't you returned any of my
          calls or e-mails?

                    JANE
          Jake, come on. This is just too
          weird. We have to just never do
          what we did - ever again. You're            
          an adulterer and I'm an awful
          person, basically. I haven't slept
          in days. What we did was just so
          wrong on so many levels.

                    JAKE
          And it was so right on a couple of
          levels too. Admit it.

                    JANE
              (finally settles)
          No! It wasn't! On no levels was
          it right!

                    JAKE
          You can't say we didn't enjoy each
          other's company. Sitting at the
          bar, dancing...after dancing...
              (she doesn't want to be
               reminded)
          Come on, you and I haven't had fun
          like that in a hundred years.               
                    JANE                              
          Yes! Because we're not supposed to
          have fun like that! We're
          divorced!   Are you like, what?
          Unhappy at home?   Does she not
          "understand" you? Did you just              
          want to know what it would be like
          with someone my age? What is this?

                    JAKE
          I'd be lying if I said I never
          think about you, Janey. I think
          about you. A lot. And no, it's not
          perfect at home. Obviously. Look
          at me. I've got three grown kids
          and I'm going to kindergarten
          interviews. I'm a walking cliche.

Jane shrugs.   She agrees.
                                       38.



           JAKE
And I can't, literally can't stop
thinking about what happened in New
York. Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.
    (she pauses...)
And I know... you've moved on with           
your life, I get it, but you can't
deny something real and honest
happened that night. Can't we just
go with it, see where it takes us.
No one has to know.
    (Jane shudders)
You were so great. So loose and
sexy. How often do you get to be
like that?    You can run and open
restaurants and build your perfect
kitchen but what about having
someone to hold you in the middle
of the night...?

          JANE
Not high on my list these days.

          JAKE
But what if that someone is someone
who's known you since you're 23 and
loved you for most of your life.

          JANE
I forgot what a good lawyer you
are.

          JAKE
Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is          
short and it's tough. Don't
discount what we have with each
other.
    (he's getting to her)
You know what they say... people in
nursing homes who have plants live
longer than the people without
plants.

          JANE
Oh, so you're saying you think this          
is a healthy choice for me?

          JAKE
Honey, I know it is.
                                                                39.




37   EXT. JANE'S GARDEN - SPRINKLERS GOING OFF                   37
     And the plants get watered.


38   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER                        38
     Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
     sober. They catch their breath.

                         JANE
               Oh, God, it's official.    We're
               having an affair.

                         JAKE
               Why do you need to label                                
               everything?

                         JANE
               Because that's what this is.

                         JAKE
               Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
               if we were two other people.

                         JANE
               Just because we were married for 19
               years does not not make this an
               affair.

                         JAKE
               Okay, but since we were together
               for so long, it's not really that
               wrong.

                         JANE
               Really? You want to run that logic
               by your wife?

     Jane fans herself.


                         JANE
               Do me a favor, you're on my side.
               Can we switch? I feel disoriented.

                         JAKE
               Since when is this your side?

                         JANE
               Since ten years ago.   Please...                        
                                                              40.



They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
on top of Jane. He pauses.

                    JAKE
          Could I interest you in a little...

                    JANE
          No!                                                       
They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed.    Jane fans
herself. So hot.                                                    
                    JAKE
              (turns to her)
          Why do you think the sex is so much
          sexier this time?

                    JANE
          I don't know.

Jane pulls the sheet up.   They look at one another. He gets        
her to smile.                                                       
                    JANE
          I've gotta get to work.

                    JAKE
          Me too. Okay...
              (moans as he sits up, then                            
               rises)

Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
checking out his stomach. He notices.

                    JAKE
              (indicating his belly)
          See what happens when you're not
          looking out for me.
              (pats it)
          She lets me eat everything.. pasta,
          cream cheese...

                    JANE
          Can you hand me my robe?

Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her.   She indicates
Jake should turn around.

                    JAKE
          Why do I have to..?
                                                 41.



                    JANE
          -- Because the last time you saw me
          standing up naked I was in my
          forties.
              (Jake can't believe this)
          Things look different lying down.
          Just...

Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.

                    JAKE
          You've gotten a little nuts.

                    JANE
              (slipping into her robe)
          Jake, I think it would be really
          good for us to not talk for a few
          days. Okay?                                  
                    JAKE
              (turning back to her)
          You know what I think -- just for
          the record? I think we're doing
          something kinda brilliant. All the
          things that tore us apart aren't
          issues anymore. I'd say our
          problems actually went away.

                    JANE                               
          What..?                                      
                    JAKE                               
          Didn't you always say you felt you
          weren't being heard? Wasn't that
          our big issue -- both of us always
          feeling rejected and unappreciated.
          Look at us now. You're so much
          more together, you're not exhausted
          all the time, you're not catering
          every weekend and busy all day with
          the kids and I'm calmer, less
          obsessed about work. I'm a partner.
          I'm there. We grew into the people           
          we wanted each other to be! And I            
          don't know... I appreciate things
          about you I couldn't even see
          before.

                    JANE
              (not wanting to get into
               it)
          Really?
                    (MORE)
                                                             42.
                         JANE(cont'd)
               Well, you know, I'm not as good as
               you at remembering all the details
               of our...

                         JAKE
                   (getting dressed)
               -- Do you remember never having
               time for sex? Now look at us.
               We've already done it two times
               this week and it's only Tuesday. I
               swear to God, if half the couples
               who got divorced, could get back
               together 10 years later, their
               problems would be solved. I think
               we're on to something.

                         JANE
               Not sure I agree and...also, we're
               not back together.                                    
                         JAKE
               And I know other divorced people
               think about this...they wonder -
               what if....
                   (fixes his tie)
               I think this is very French of us.

                         JANE
               How is this French of us?

                         JAKE
               I have a young wife but I'm having
               sex with my old wife. Not old, you
               know. Ex!
                   (Jane nods....)
               I didn't mean old...

39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head
                                                               39    
     toward THE FRONT DOOR.

                          JAKE
               You're doing that thing where you
               act like you're not listening...
               but think about what I'm saying,
               okay?
                   (then)
               Do you have any of your homemade
               granola here? I haven't had it in
               so long.

                         JANE
               You miss it?
                                                             43.



                          JAKE
               So much.

                         JANE
               We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the
               store.

                         JAKE
               Yeah, why give it away when you
               can...
                   (Jane OPENS the front door
                    and moves him outside)
               Kiss good bye?

     Jane kisses him on the cheek.

                         JAKE
               She wants to be courted!
                   (as he heads for his car)
               I can do that!
                   (turns back)                                      
               And honey, thanks for the....
                   (indicates sex with his
                    fingers)
               -- Coffee....

     Jane can't close the door fast enough.


40   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                40
     Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE     
     LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food
     and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.

                         TRISHA
               Oh my God, now what?   Three pies?!                   
               This is a feast!

                         JANE
               I don't know what's going on, I
               have so much energy lately which I
               think is probably a result of...
               all the sex I'm having.
                   (the Ladies LAUGH)
               Yeah. I'm actually not kidding.
               I'm having an affair.
                   (They stare at her)
               With a married man.
                                                 44.



                    DIANE
          What? When did this happen?
          Where'd you meet him?

                    JANE
          Well, it... started in New York.

                    DIANE
          In New York??? Last week?

                    JANE
          Yeah, we did it once there and once
          here. Maybe more than once there,
          I was drunk so...

                    TRISHA
          You had drunken sex with a married
          man in New York when you went for
          Luke's graduation?

                    JANE
              (laughs, embarrassed)
          Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.
              (re: pies)
          Apple, Blueberry or Plum?                    
                    DIANE
          Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....                
          You're not saying!!!!

                    JOANNE
              (clueless)
          -- What?

                    TRISHA
              (catching on)
          No! You're not!

                    JANE
          Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an
          affair with Agness Adler's husband.

The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.

                    TRISHA
          That. Is. Genius!

                    JOANNE
          But also sort of wrong.

                    JANE
          I know.
                                       45.



          DIANE
Oh, please. Not that wrong.

          JANE
I know! I'm so happy to be able to
tell someone. This is the most out           
of control thing I've ever done.             
Literally. You know me.

          DIANE
Yes we do. You don't do anything
wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're               
allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
kinda love it.

          JOANNE
He was yours first.

         JANE
True. Not that I want him back by
the way.

           TRISHA
Of course not. You can do better
than Jake.

          JANE
    (a little insulted)
Thanks.

          TRISHA
I mean you've outgrown him. You've
blossomed, you feng shuied your
whole life... Just please, don't
let him talk you into saving him.

           JANE
I won't...
    (wonders what that means)

          DIANE
There is something kinda perfect
about this. You don't have to cook
for him or clean up after him or
actually even sleep with him....

          JANE
Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...          
                                                              46.



                         JANE (CONT'D)                                
               But, girls, what about the fact
               that I'm now the other woman? I'm
               the one we hate.

                         TRISHA
               Oh, forget that.    Agness is still                    
               the one we hate.    Even in this
               scenario.

                         DIANE
               Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch
               on this one.


41   INT. BAKERY KITCHEN - DAY                                 41
     Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
     Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
     prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
     tray of cookies out of the oven.                                 
                         JANE
               Reynaldo, I'm changing the
               breakfast menu, want to give it a
               little more life...
                   (shows it to him, he seems                         
                    distracted)                                       
               What do you think?

                          REYNALDO
                   (distracted)                                       
               -- What'd you do? Something to
               your hair?

                         JANE
               I don't think so.

                         REYNALDO
               Something about you looks
               different. Little more "caliente."                     
                           JANE
               Caliente?

     Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.

                         REYNALDO
               You see it Eddie?

                         EDDIE
               Whatever it is, it's workin'.
                                                                47.



     He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter.    Jane blushes as
     her cell phone rings.

                         JANE
               Hello.
                   (listens)
               No! I didn't do this again!


42   EXT. JANE'S OPEN FIELD   - LATE DAY                         42
     CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of
     the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape.        
     REVERSE - ON JANE

     Rushing toward Adam.

                         JANE
               Adam, I'm so sorry.   My mind is
               just... Forgive me.

                         ADAM
               If I were your shrink I'd say maybe
               you don't really want to build this
               house.

                         JANE
               That's completely not true.   I'm
               really sorry.
                   (looks at taped off
                    addition)                                          
               Oh! I like it already!                                  
                         ADAM
               Yeah, it's feeling really good. So,                     
               this becomes your office. We come                       
               down your new hallway, the windows                      
               are all along here...                                   
                         JANE
               Great. Love it.                                         
                         ADAM
               And from here to there...wait, let                      
               me get the door for you...                              
                   (opens a piece of tape)                             
               Your kitchen.                                           
                   (they ENTER)                                        
               We're in the eating area. How's                         
               the size?
                   (pretends to sit)
               We're at either end of the table.
                                                              48.



                         JANE
                   (laughs at Adam)                                    
               Feels perfect.

                         ADAM
               I thought so too.                                       
                         JANE
                   (taking it all in)                                  
               This is heaven!                                         
                         ADAM
               It's gonna be cool.    Want to go                       
               upstairs?                                               


43   JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS                     43
                         ADAM
               So if you were lying in bed, this
               would be your view.

     Jane breaks into a smile.


     THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN

     Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her
     phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses,
     then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance.
     Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.

                           ADAM
               You okay?

                         JANE
                   (grabs her heart)
               Yeah.

     WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET


44   INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                    44
     Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
     sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
     away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
     then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
     and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
     he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
     calling his name in anger. He leaps.
                                                         49.



                      JAKE
          Coming!

Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his
path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
him.

                    PEDRO
          What were you doing in there?

                    JAKE
          Going to the bathroom.

                    PEDRO
          The toilet didn't flush.

                    JAKE
          Yes it did.

                    PEDRO
          Why were you in the shower with
          your clothes on?

                    JAKE
              (making sure Agness
               doesn't hear)
          What are you talking about?

                    PEDRO
          I heard the shower door close.

                    JAKE
          What do you have, x-ray ears?

Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking
through. She holds a broom.

                    AGNESS
          What's up Pedro?

                    PEDRO
          Jake took a shower with his clothes
          on.

                      JAKE
          Pedro!    Darling...                                   
                    AGNESS
          What's he talking about?

                    JAKE
          I don't speak Pedro.   That's your
          department.
                                                              50.



                          AGNESS
                   (to Pedro)
               Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke
               something.
                   (to Jake, annoyed)
               Yo. Can you help?

     Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.

45   TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN       45
     These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
     carried to Jane's counter. We're:


     INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING                               
     Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two
     waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands
     nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.                          
                         ADAM
               That looks amazing.

                         JANE
               It's called a croque-monsieur. It's
               one of the first things I learned
               to make when I lived in Paris
               because the ingredients are really
               really cheap.

                         ADAM
               When did you live in Paris?

                         JANE
               In my early twenties. I went there
               to take a six day pastry class and
               ended up staying a year working as
               an apprentice in a bakery.                              
     Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE
     BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.                              
                          JANE
               Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails                      
               and turning them into something so                      
               beautiful.                                              
                                                              51.



                         ADAM
               You are rapidly becoming one of the                   
               most appreciative clients I've ever                   
               had...                                                
                         JANE
               Well, I'm not all that used to                        
               being able to count on anyone...                      
                         ADAM
                   (surprised by that)
               Really?                                               


46   JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME                                  46
     He squints, looking ahead, SEES:

     JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP

     And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS
     HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.


47   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                       47
                         JANE
               I know it's none of my business
               but... I'm trying to figure out why
               someone like you is divorced.

                         ADAM
               And what'd you come up with?

                         JANE
               Something in the you're too nice
               department..?

                         ADAM
               Yes, that and my wife fell in love
               with my best friend. Ex-best                          
               friend.                                               
                         JANE
               Oh, no!

                         ADAM
               We were all on a biking trip, he                      
               and his wife, me and my
               wife...through Tuscany and on the
               last day of the trip they announced
               they were in love.
                                                              52.



                         JANE
               That's awful.

                          ADAM
               Yeah.   Not a great plane ride home.

                         JANE
               I can imagine, sitting there for
               eleven hours with your wife who you
               know is -- oh, that's rough.

                         ADAM
               Actually they went on to Venice and
               I flew back with Carol, his wife.
               You can't imagine what it's like to                     
               sit next to someone who's been                          
               crying for ten straight hours.                          
                         JANE
               I don't blame her.

                         ADAM
               I was talking about me. Anyway,
               they're married now and it's
               pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
               But, you and your ex... When I saw
               him stop by for a cup of coffee the
               other morning, I thought -- Wow!                        
               That's the way it's supposed to be.                     
               You two seem to have it all figured
               out.

                         JANE
               We're not as figured out as you'd
               think.


48   EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                      48
     Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn,         
     careful not to be seen.                                           

49   BACK TO SCENE                                               49
     Jane clears their dishes.

                         JANE
                   (laughs)
               You know I hope you don't feel I've
               been interrogating you, but...
                         (MORE)
                                                             53.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          I know what it's like to have your
          ex remarried and to not have so
          much going on in that department.
          I mean, do you date ever or...                           
                    ADAM
          Uh, constantly actually.

                    JANE
          Constantly?

                    ADAM
          Everyone I know or have ever known
          has fixed me up. And then,
          sometimes I just meet women, I
          don't know how that happens, but...

                    JANE
          -- But no girlfriend?

                     ADAM
          Not yet.

Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.

                    JANE
          Just like to date...

                    ADAM
          Actually, I find it really
          stressful. You know, the last time
          I was in the dating world was 1978.                      
          It's a little more complicated
          these days. I can't tell you how                         
          nice it is to have a conversation                        
          with a woman and have the pressure
          off. Not to mention, a home cooked
          meal that no one else I know could
          possibly cook.

Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She
smiles, wiping the counter.

                    ADAM
          That was a compliment. So you                            
          don't have a guy in your life at
          the moment?

                    JANE
          No....
              (starts to say something.)
          No.
                                                                54.



                          ADAM
               No?




     EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                                       
     Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.        
     He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a         
     stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and        
     both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to           
     hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,        
     he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.                    


51   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER                               51
     Jane walks Adam to the door.    He holds rolled blueprints.

                         ADAM
               This was so nice and relaxing and
               the lavender ice cream was actually
               the best dessert of any sort I've
               ever had... like, in my life.

                         JANE
               Aw, thank you. I always make ice
               cream when I can't sleep, so I'm
               glad someone was here to eat it.
                   (opens door)

                         ADAM
                   (pauses...)                                           
               Great getting to know you a little.

                          JANE
                   (nods)
               It was really fun.

     Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward.          
     Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for
     the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.

                          JANE
               Woops!   Coming!

     Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:

     JAKE

     leaning in the door frame.
                                                 55.



                    JAKE
          O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.
              (entering)
          Hello Jane, you look very beautiful
          tonight.

He takes her in his arms.

                   JAKE
          Mmmmm. Love when you smell like
          butter.

                    JANE
              (easing away)
          What are you doing here?

                    JAKE
          Missed you.

                    JANE
          It's nine o'clock. Where does your
          wife think you are?

                    JAKE
          At yoga.   Shall we do some
          downward facing dog?

                    JANE
          Not tonight big guy.

They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.

                    JAKE
          Is it really necessary for you to
          always say no before you say yes? I
          won't think less of you, you know.

                    JANE
          Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I
          was just gonna take a bath.

                    JAKE
          Good. So, we'll just hang out.
              (now IN THE KITCHEN, he
               SEES the dinner dishes on
               the counter)
          Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?
          Who's plate is this? Yours or his?

                    JANE
          Mine.
                                                              56.



                         JAKE
                   (eats her leftovers,
                    savors the taste)
               Oh my God, just as I remember it.

                         JANE
               Don't you ever eat at your house?

                         JAKE
               Pedro dictates all meals and he has
               a very limited palate.
                   (sees melted ice cream)
               What kind of ice cream is that?

                         JANE
               Lavender Honey.

                         JAKE
                   (immediately)                                      
               Not sleeping?

                         JANE
               Not at all. You?

                         JAKE
               Never slept better. And my                             
               digestion is finally back on track.
               You've turned my world right side
               up, Jane. You know what this
               means, don't you?

                            JANE
               No...

                         JAKE
               That I've never really known how to
               live without you.


52   INT. JANE'S BATHROOM                                      52
     Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning
     against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.

                         JAKE
               Maybe we should be growing old
               together.

                         JANE
               Hate to tell you, big guy, but we
               already grew old apart.
                                                 57.



                    JAKE
          What's with the `big guy'? Is that
          because you think I'm fat or is it
          a term of endearment?                        
                    JANE
          I have no idea why I keep saying
          that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.

                     JAKE
          Thank you.
              (then)
          I love how quiet it is in your
          house. I have no quiet in my life.
          Ever.

                    JANE
          Yeah, well, you live with a five             
          year old.

                    JAKE
          Yes...and don't forget Pedro.

Jane splashes him.

                    JANE
          So what does that mean exactly...?           
          What's going on over there at your
          place?

                    JAKE
          My marriage is... not turning out
          as I hoped. That's obvious....
          Agness started out really looking
          up to me... We never used to fight
          but now... with the kid....lately
          we're all about where he's gonna go
          to school and now she says we need           
          a bigger house, more help. I was
          thinking of cutting back at work...          
          now that's never gonna happen. And           
          she wants another baby before Pedro
          gets too old which I get but since
          we're always fighting... oh, God,
          listen to me.

                    JANE
          Isn't a baby part of the deal when
          you marry a woman that age?
                                                          58.



                     JAKE
          Is it? I guess so. She's got me
          booked at the fertility center
          every other day and she's so amped
          up on hormone injections I may need
          to find an exorcist if she doesn't
          calm down.                                            
               (Jane laughs)
          I wish it was funny.
               (finishes his ice cream)
          Incredible ice cream. I'm turning
          around...
               (as he turns, Jane shrinks
                in the tub)
          Remember when we used to smoke pot
          and eat your ice cream in the hot
          tub?

                    JANE
          The "hot tub"... That feels like a
          billion years ago.

                    JAKE
          How long has it been since you...                     
              (indicates smoking a                              
               joint)                                           
                     JANE
          Me?   Since before Lauren was born.

                    JAKE
          27 years?!!

                      JANE
          At least.

Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.          
                    JANE
          Are you kidding me? Put that away!                    
          It's been too long...

                      JAKE
          Exactly.

                    JANE                                        
          I'm not going to....                                  
                    JAKE                                        
          Okay, why don't I leave this with                     
          you... (It's kind of amazing.)                        
          Maybe you'll take a few hits...
                    (MORE)
                                                                59.
                            JAKE(cont'd)
                  get your sea legs, then we'll smoke
                  the rest of it together.

                              JANE
                  Maybe....

     Jake places the joint in a drawer.

                            JAKE
                  So that nerdy architect likes
                  you...you know that, right?

                            JANE
                  He's not nerdy and he definitely
                  doesn't. We're working together.

                            JAKE
                  I was watching when you bent down
                  to open the oven, his eyes were
                  glued to your ass.

                            JANE
                      (changing the subject)                           
                  Hey, will you do me a favor?


53   INT. FOYER                                                  53
     Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the
     chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him.                  

                            JAKE
                      (looking down at her,
                       smiles)
                  Tell the truth, Janey is this a
                  great affair, or what?

                            JANE
                  I don't know. It's my first.

                            JAKE
                      (climbing down)
                  We don't even have to have sex and
                  it's fun.
                      (arrives next to her)
                  I wish I could sleep over.

                            JANE
                  I gotta tell my shrink about this.
                  This is a lot to handle. I guess
                  you should go ... I'm sure yoga's
                  probably closed by now.
                            (MORE)
                                                         60.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          Oh, you got a little ice cream on
          your shirt. Let me get that out.

                    JAKE
          It's okay...

Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He
lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him
on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He
softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way
up her neck.   Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the
lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.

                    JANE
          Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,
          Jake?

The Phone RINGS.   Jane pauses.                                 
                    JAKE                                        
          Don't get it.                                         
                      JANE
          I always get it. I have three
          kids.
              (Jake wishes she wouldn't.
                She hesitates, picks it
                up)
          Hello. Hiii...
              (makes an I told you so
                face)
          You still on the plane? How was
          Luke when you left? Oh, that                          
          sounds like fun. Let me know what
          I can bring..... No! Don't have                       
          any idea where he is.
              (points to Jake)
          Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.
              (hangs up)
          Now I'm lying...... Lauren and                        
          Harley are giving Luke a graduation
          party this weekend. Sweet, huh?

Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling.

                    JAKE
              (into phone)
          Hello stranger. Welcome back.

Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and
then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another.
                                                               61.



                         JAKE
                   (into phone)
               -- Just getting in my car. This                        
               weekend? Sounds great. Let me
               know what I can bring...

     Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless.
     Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his
     cell.


54   EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING                  54
     Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from
     her bakery.   She's clearly waiting for someone.

     She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES           
     holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the             
     building's entrance.

                          JANE
                   (approaching him)
               Dr. Allen!

                         DR. ALLEN
                   (surprised to see her)
               Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?                       
                         JANE
               No, I just need to talk...and I was                    
               wondering if there was any chance
               you could squeeze me in for an
               emergency session. I'm sort of
               desperate for some advice. I
               brought you some of that coffee
               cake you like. Not as a bribe or
               anything...

                         DR. ALLEN
                   (checks his watch)
               I only have twenty minutes until my
               first patient.

                         JANE
               That's fine. I'll talk fast.                           


55   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER          55
     Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.                   
                                                               62.



                          JANE
                    (whispering)
                So, at this point, I just need some                   
                sound, unbiased guidance. Is                          
                having an affair with you know who
                a good thing or a bad thing?
                    (they stop at Dr. Allen's
                     office door)
                It's a bad thing, right? How could
                it be good?

                          DR. ALLEN
                    (opening his door)
                It's not good. It's not bad.

     Oh, man.   Not what she needs to hear.                           

56   INT. OFFICE                                                56
     Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.   Dr. Allen
     turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.                         
                          DR. ALLEN
                You know, things happen in life and                   
                our job is to find out why. What                      
                we have to do is take a real look
                at this. Are you ready to do that?

                          JANE
                I am. Definitely. I've made a list                    
                of what this can possibly be
                about...at my end. Can I read it
                to you?

                           DR. ALLEN                                  
                    (taking his seat)                                 
                Of course.                                            
                          JANE
                    (digging out her                                  
                     Blackberry)                                      
                Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself.                      
                    (reads from Blackberry)
                Okay. Am I still trying to figure
                out why the marriage failed? Do I
                want to get back together? Do we
                have unfinished business? Is this                     
                about revenge?   Am I just...                         
                lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker"                      
                thing?
                          (MORE)
                                                       63.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          You know, the kids are finally gone                
          and now all of a sudden Jake's back
          and I get to take care of him in
          some way...

Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.          
                    JANE                                     
          And, listen, I get how therapy                     
          works, I do... We look at things,                  
          we examine them, weeks turn into
          months, what....? we're going on                   
          eight years, right?.... and I'm                    
          okay with that, I like it... but in
          this case, I need to know what you
          really think. Like, I'd like you                   
          to say... Don't do this, it's
          absolutely wrong or go ahead,
          you'll be fine. I actually want to
          be told what to do.

                    DR. ALLEN
          What's interesting is I'm already
          seeing you open up more than I have
          in some time. I'm thinking,                        
          through this affair, you may learn                 
          to view the world in a different
          way.

                    JANE
          I'm sorry. I need more concrete.
          Are you saying I should keep seeing
          him? Because, honestly, if the                     
          guilt and fear could go away, maybe
          I could let go a little and figure                 
          this out.

                    DR. ALLEN
          I wouldn't resist looking at this.

                    JANE
              (mulls that over quickly)                      
          Okay... and another way of saying                  
          that is....?

                    DR. ALLEN
          Let go Jane. It can't hurt.                        
Jane fist pumps in the air.
                                                              64.




57   INT. SANTA BARBARA FERTILITY CENTER RECEPTION - DAY          57
     Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men
     all with their much younger Wives.   A Nurse ENTERS, holding       
     a chart.

                         NURSE
               Jacob Adler?                                             
     Jake rises.   One of the younger women whispers...

                         WOMAN
               Have fun...                                              


58   INT. FERTILITY CENTER OFFICES                                58
     The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a
     pleather barcalounger, a TV and a DVD player.

                          NURSE
               Okay, you know the drill. You can
               hang your things in the closest,
               the remote is on top of the TV and
               the materials are in the drawers.
                   (cleaning the remote with
                     an anti-bacterial wipe)
               Please deposit your specimen in the
               cup and I'll see you when you're
               done.

     She dims the light before leaving.

     Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off
     his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his PHONE
     RINGS. He looks at the name of the caller. Smiles.

                          JAKE
               Hi.

59   JANE WALKS QUICKLY THROUGH A FARMER'S MARKET ON HER CELL. 59

                         JANE
                   (on her cell)
               Hey, where are you?

                         JAKE
               At the office.

                         JANE
               Want to grab some lunch?
                                                              65.



                         JAKE
               Absolutely. When?

                         JANE
               Can you do it now? I have about an
               hour. Thought we could go to The                       
               Stanhope....get room service.                          
                   (she's nervous just saying
                    it)

                         JAKE
                   (rising)
               Be there in ten!

                         JANE
               See you there, Adler.

                         JAKE
                   (hangs up)                                         
               She's comin' back!

     Jake rushes to put on his pants, catches his foot in the
     pant's hem, hops to safety. He reaches for his jacket then
     grabs an anti-bacterial wipe, using it to turn the door knob.


60   INT. THE STANHOPE LOBBY/CAFE - DAY                        60     
     Harley and Lauren are having lunch in the CAFE connected to
     the Lobby. Harley has a clear view of the Lobby's Reception
     Desk. Lauren has her back to it.

                         LAUREN
               -- Luke's so excited about his
               party. We can fit forty people in
               our place, can't we?

                         HARLEY
               Sure, if nobody wants to sit                           
               down...                                                
                   (notices JAKE ENTERING the
                    hotel)
               -- Hey, there's your...

     Harley then realizes JAKE IS signing the Register and            
     CHECKING IN and chokes on his French Fry.

                          LAUREN
               My what...
                   (starts to turn)

     Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even
     though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.
                                                         66.



                       LAUREN
          Harley!!!

                    HARLEY
          I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on
          you. I just needed to kiss you.

                    LAUREN
          While you were choking?

                       HARLEY
          It worked.     I'm not choking
          anymore.

Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON
JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE
ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he
watches.

                    LAUREN
              (turning)
          Who did you just see?

Luckily Jake is now gone.

                    HARLEY
          No one. Thought it was your
          cousin...but...

Harley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS
TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the
same elevator.                                                   
                    HARLEY
          Ohhhh my sweet Lord....

                    LAUREN
              (looks up from her salad)
          Now what?

                     HARLEY
          Honey, I totally forgot I have a
          conference call at 1:15, I gotta
          get back to the office. Waiter!
          Honey, stop eating, get the waiter.
          Call the one over there.
              (pointing her away from
               Jane)

                    LAUREN
          Harley, we can't leave, we're
          meeting with the Wedding
          Specialist.
                                                                67.



                          HARLEY
                   (watches as Jake waits for
                    Jane around the corner)                            
               Yeah, you know what? Today's not a
               good idea to do that.                                   
                   (Sees Jane join Jake, they                          
                    step into the elevator                             
                    and immediately fall into                          
                    each other's arms and                              
                    kiss)                                              
               Oh my God...!!!                                         


61   INT. JAKE AND JANE'S HOTEL ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME TIME      61
     The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel
     robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song,
     perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS
     and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe.

     Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one
     another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it
     fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and
     back. They smile at one another, then something comes over
     Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses
     against the wall.

                         JANE
               Jake!!!                                                 


62   INT. LOBBY CAFE - SAME TIME                                 62
     The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's
     table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a
     mess, knowing what's going on upstairs.

                         WEDDING SPECIALIST
               I adore October weddings. Let me
               show you what we did last October.

     She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps.

                         HARLEY
                   (rising)
               Honey, I'm gonna make that phone
               call from the...

     Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't
     hear him. They keep talking to each other.
                                                              68.



                          HARLEY
                   (nods)
               -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing
               that and I'll...                                      
     They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE        
     LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving
     at the Reception Desk.

                         HOTEL DOC
               What's the room number?

                         RECEPTION CLERK                             
               408. Adler. His wife said he's                        
               conscious now...

                          HOTEL DOC
                   (taking off)
               On my way.

     Harley stops in his tracks, freaking.   Adler???


63   INT. JANE AND JAKE'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER           63
     Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff
     around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel
     Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed.

                         HOTEL DOC
               Your blood pressure's good.

                         JANE
               How's his heart?

                         HOTEL DOC
               Do you have a heart condition, Mr.
               Adler?

                          JAKE
               No.   And I just had a check up.

                          JANE
               You did?   Oh, that's good.

                         HOTEL DOC
                   (listening to his heart)
               Deep breath. So, no chest pain?

                          JAKE
               None.
                                                69.



                    HOTEL DOC
          When you got dizzy, did you feel
          your heart was beating funny?

                    JAKE
          Yes, but I was admiring my
          beautiful...
              (indicates Jane)

Jane holds up her weak eyelid.

                    HOTEL DOC
          -- Well that's nice to hear after
          all these years...
              (winds up his stethoscope)
          Did you forget to take any of your
          medications today?

                    JAKE
          Took `em all.

                    HOTEL DOC
          What all did you take?                      
                    JAKE
          Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin..               
              (whispers)
          Flomax.

                    JANE
              (sitting on the bed)
          Flomax?

                     JAKE
               (embarrassed)
          Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a
          day.

                    HOTEL DOC
          How long have you been taking the           
          Flomax?

                    JAKE
          Not that long. And I only take it
          sporadically. I have to sneak it
          actually.
              (explains confidentially)
          It reduces semen and that's not
          good for my wife right now.
              (to Jane)
          Sorry.
                                                              70.



                            HOTEL DOC
                      (looks over at Jane)
                  Really..?

                            JANE
                  Yes, I prefer a lot of semen.
                  Always have.
                      (rises)
                  Okay, well, thank you so much for                   
                  coming. Looks like he's gonna live,
                  so...

                            HOTEL DOC
                      (packing up)
                  Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
                  probably the culprit here. It can
                  definitely give you a sudden drop
                  in blood pressure so I suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks, which
                  apparently your wife will
                  appreciate.
                      (holds in a chuckle)

                             JANE
                  Yeah.   Really good for me.

     The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.

                            HOTEL DOC
                  And I suggest you rest quietly for
                  the rest of the afternoon.
                      (to Jane)
                  No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.

                            JANE
                  No chance. I assure you.


64   INT. LOBBY                                                64
     Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren
     arrives, joins him on the bench.

                            LAUREN
                  Are you acting like this because of
                  the wedding? Tell me the truth?

                            HARLEY
                      (head down)
                  Not at all. Swear to God.
                                                             71.



                         LAUREN
               Because I don't want to be one of
               those couples where the guy goes
               into a coma the whole time we plan
               the wedding. It's not worth it to
               me.

     Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception
     Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps
     on walking.

                         HARLEY
                   (deep sigh, rises)
               Okay! We're back in business!


65   OPRAH - CLOSE - ON TV                                    65
     In Jane and Jake's room.

     REVERSE - JANE AND JAKE

     Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating
     chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane
     eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with
     love and appreciation.

                         JAKE
               See. Just that move...you have no                     
               idea. Not everyone's like that...

                         JANE
                   (mutes Oprah, then:)
               Jake, I have a confession to make.                    
               Back when we broke up... I knew it
               wasn't all your fault.

                         JAKE
               You mean that?   You've never said
               that to me before.                                    
                         JANE
               I know. Because when you cheated,                     
               I didn't have to. But I think in
               some way, I gave up on us and I'm
               not sure you ever really did.

                         JAKE
               I still haven't.


     Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring,
     then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:
                                                                72.



                         JANE
               Are you and Agness... still having
               sex?

     Jake doesn't answer.    Jane turns, looks right at him.

                         JAKE
               Only if she initiates it.

     Jane GROANS.                                                      
                          JAKE
               I'm trying not to rock the boat at
               home until you and I figure this
               out.
                    (sees her reaction)
               This is a little trickier at my end
               than yours.

                         JANE
               Right. Yeah. Okay....                                   
                   (rises...)
               Now I know you're gonna think I'm                       
               leaving because of what you just                        
               said, but I'm not. I really have
               to get back to work.

                         JAKE
                   (takes Jane's hand)
               We got really close there for a
               moment.

     She knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.     She lets it ring
     again, then answers it.

                         JANE
                   (into phone)
               Hello?

66   ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE                                        66
                         ADAM
                   (into phone)
               Hi, hope I'm not interrupting
               anything.

     INTERCUT JANE AND ADAM

                            JANE
               Adam! Oh!     Hi.
                                                               73.



     Jake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet,
     starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very
     engaged by Adam.

                         ADAM
               I just found out there's a French
               Film Festival in town and that made
               me think of you so I was wondering
               if you'd like to go to the opening
               night tomorrow night.
                   (a little nervous... will
                    she accept?)

                         JANE
               Oh, that sounds so fun...
                   (Jake rolls his eyes)
               Let me think, tomorrow's what?

                         JAKE
                   (desperate, whispers)
               -- Say you're busy. Agness has a
               dinner thing tomorrow, I can come
               over.
                   (Jane hesitates)
               Please.

                         JANE
               Oh, um, you know, I'd really love
               to, but, my son is coming home from
               college the next day and I have a
               bunch of things I have to do to get
               ready...
                   (hates lying, Jake crosses
                    to her, smiles)
               I'm so sorry.

                         ADAM
               No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe
               we can see something another night.

                         JANE
               Absolutely. I would love that.                         
     Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.           


67   ADAM HANGS UP                                              67
     We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them
     then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.
                                                              74.



                          ADAM
               Melanie, how would you and your
               husband like two tickets to the
               opening of the French Film
               Festival? Reserved seats...VIP
               parking...

                            FEMALE WORKER
               Seriously?


68   INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              68
     Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about,
     putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...                 
                         JAKE
               You'll make the whole thing?    The
               roast chicken, the---

                         JANE
               -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string
               beans and double fudge chocolate                         
               cake. I know your favorite dinner,
               Jakey.

                         JAKE
                   (touched)
               You haven't called me Jakey in 10
               years. This has been a great day
               for us. So, do we have a date?                           
                         JANE
                   (fixes Jake's hair)
               We have a date.                                          
     Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face       
     as we begin to HEAR MUSIC.                                         


69   EXT. JANE'S PATIO -    LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER                 69
     Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in      
     her courtyard. She's singing along with the music.                 

70   A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER                                  70
     sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the
     cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at        
     her perfect roast chicken.                                         

71   OMIT                                                         71
                                                              75.




72   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - MUSIC OVER                             72
     Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off       
     its hanger.


73   A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND                                     73
     tells us it's 8:45.

     ON JAKE

     His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS'
     BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper
     work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping         
     his cell into his hand.                                            
                         AGNESS
                   (not looking at him)
               Why are you taking your cell to the
               bathroom?

                         JAKE
               Oh. Didn't mean to.
                   (places it back on the
                    night stand)

                         AGNESS
               Carry him to his bed, will you?

     Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed.

                         AGNESS
                   (while reading)
               And hurry back. I'm ovulating.

                           JAKE
               You are?

                         AGNESS
               Why do you think I cancelled my
               dinner?

     Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.


74   INT. PEDRO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               74
     Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro
     takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him.       
     Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.
                                                               76.


     Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding
     onto his hand.                                                   


75   EXT. JANE'S PATIO - NIGHT                                  75
     Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is      
     set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been          
     opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still
     dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very      
     deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
     room, the house becomes dark.


76   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - 6 P.M.                  76
     The Kids cars are in the driveway.


77   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME                        77
     Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking,      
     setting the table, opening wine, chatting.

                         LAUREN                                       
               -- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to                       
               tell you about our meeting at The                      
               Stanhope. We went there for lunch                      
               two days ago and met with their                        
               Wedding Specialist....I think that                     
               could be the place, Mom....                            
                         JANE
               Two days ago you went to The                           
               Stanhope...for lunch?                                  
                         HARLEY
               Yes and guess what?    We saw                          
               nothing.                                               
     Jane and Harley connect.    He immediately looks away.           
                         LAUREN                                       
               What is that supposed to mean?                         
                         HARLEY                                       
               Who wants wine? Anyone?                                
                   (starts pouring)                                   
                         GABBY                                        
                   (looking in the fridge)                            
               Mom, you have an insane amount of
               food in here, even for you.
                                                        77.



                    JANE
              (taking out last night's
               roast chicken)
          I knew you were all going to be
          here for the weekend so I made a
          bunch of stuff last night.

                    LAUREN                                      
          Looks like Jake Adler's favorite
          meal to me.

                    JANE
              (laughs)
          Very funny.

                       HARLEY                                   
          Very.                                                 
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn        
HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL    
UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the      
Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and       
pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.    
                       JANE                                     
          Harley?                                               
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.                      
                    JANE
          Yay!!!!
              (hugs Luke)

                    LUKE
              (surveying all the food)
          Mom, this looks amazing.

Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo...

                       JAKE
                 (sheepishly joins the
                  group, eyes on Jane)
          Hi.

                       JANE
                 (briskly)
          Hey.

Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine.                           
                    JAKE
              (holding Luke's backpack)
          Where should I put this...?
                                                         78.



                    JANE
              (turns her back on him,
               making herself busy)
          Wherever.

Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake
looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them.
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
Jane slices the roast chicken.

                    JAKE
          That looks incredible.                                
Jane looks up at him, knife poised.    Is he kidding?

                      JANE
          Thanks.

She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
Jake flinches.

                     HARLEY
          Jake?   Glass of wine?

                      JAKE
          Uh, sure.    Thanks.

                      HARLEY
          Jane?

                    JANE
              (not looking up)
          No thank you.

Jake's cell RINGS.    He turns his back to take it.

                    JAKE
              (into cell)
          Hi Ag... Just got here.

Jane has a hot flash.    Starts fanning herself.

                    JAKE
              (into cell)
          Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.
              (turns back to the family)
          I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.

                      JANE
          Bye-bye.

The Girls look to Jane.
                                     79.



          JAKE
I have to stop at the market.
Agness is making some pasta thing
and she ran out of olive oil.

          GABBY                            
Hey, at least she's finally
cooking.

          JAKE
So...see everybody at the party
tomorrow...                                
           LAUREN
Yeah.   It's gonna be so fun.

          JANE
    (to Lauren)
I told you I'm bringing someone,
right?

            LAUREN
No. Who?

           JANE
Adam.   My architect.

          JAKE
You're bringing your architect?

            JANE
Yes I am.

          JAKE
Like as a date?

          JANE
    (looking right at him)
Yeah.

          GABBY                            
I like the idea.

            JANE
Me too.

          HARLEY
Yeah, seems like it should round
out everything really nicely.
    (pouring another drink)
Nobody wants wine but me?
                                                               80.



     Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
     it to Jake.

                         LUKE
               Here, now you can stay another five
               minutes.
                   (catches Jane's eye)
               You have three bottles in there.

                         JAKE
               Janey, can I talk to you privately?
               Just for a sec.

     Jane heads out still holding the carving knife.   Harley slips
     the knife out of her hand.

                         HARLEY
               There you go....
                   (to Kids)
               Somebody's talkin' graduation gift.


78   INT. COURTYARD                                             78
     Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.

                         JANE
               What is it, Jake?   What?

                         JAKE
               I don't get not calling me back.

                          JANE
               `Cause I don't care what your
               excuse is.
                   (shuts the door to the
                    living )

                         JAKE
               She didn't go out, Jane. She
               cancelled her plans and every
               time I tried to call or write, she
               caught me. I wanted to be here.

                         JANE
               You know what, Jake? You were
               worried about rocking the boat at
               home? Well now you're rocking my                        
               boat and I don't like it.

                         JAKE
                   (stopping her)
               Honey, don't let one night...
                                       81.



          JANE
You don't understand. I'm not even
blaming you. I fully participated
in this. But I don't want to do it
anymore. The last thing in the
world I should be right now is your
mistress, sitting around at nine at
night wearing heels and perfume and
blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap because
your wife cancelled her plans. It
was cliche and humiliating.

          JAKE
    (wistfully)
You lit candles?

          JANE
Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
pretty good life these past 10
years. I figured it out and I
moved on. I no longer feel alone
or divorced. I just feel normal.
You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?

          JAKE
No.

          JANE
The point is, I'm going in the
wrong direction here. But the
worst part is... It's feeling like
it used to feel. All the little
untruths that are hard to catch but
add up...

           JAKE
-- Janey, c'mon, it was one
mistake...

          HARLEY
    (joining them)
-- Everything okay out here?
    (Jane and Jake turn)
The kids are gettin' hungry...

          JANE
Yeah. We're done.
    (walks away, pauses in
     front of Harley)
We were just...
                                                            82.



                    HARLEY
              (as she passes)
          -- None of my beeswax, Jane.
              (once she's gone)
          And please never tell me.

 Lauren joins.                                                    
                       LAUREN
          What's up?

                    JAKE
          Nothin', punky.
              (rubs her arm)

                    LAUREN
              (taking Jake back inside)                           
          Yeah? So, we're going to see you                        
          tomorrow night, for sure, right?                        
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt        
sleeve.                                                           
                    JANE                                          
          Okay...What did you see and what do                     
          you know?                                               
                    HARLEY                                        
          Nothing. Really.                                        
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.          
                    HARLEY                                        
              (confesses rapidly)                                 
          Okay, he checked in, you arrived,                       
          you met in the elevator, possible                       
          kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor                      
          came down, thumbs up. That's it.                        
          Have no idea what happened in                           
          between.                                                
                    JANE                                          
              (dying...)                                          
          Have you told Lauren?                                   
                    HARLEY                                        
          No and I won't --                                       
                    LUKE                                          
              (joining them)                                      
          Mom. Dad's leaving...                                   
                                                                 83.




      INT. HOUSE                                                        
      Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is          
      about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which       
      now has dinner on it.                                             
      Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the           
      others who are about to sit down for dinner.                      
                             LUKE
                       (from the Dining Room)                           
                   Thanks for picking me up, Dad...

      Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's          
      eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then          
      heads out.                                                        

      EXT. HOUSE                                                        
      Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees        
      his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He        
      heads toward his car as...                                        
      JANE

      glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the       
      kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...


A80   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT          A80
      Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
      across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a
      tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.           

      OMIT                                                              

81    IN THE BATHROOM                                             81
      Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She       
      puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens       
      a drawer to take out a lipstick.

      INSERT - THE DRAWER

      Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her.
      She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.      
                                                                 84.




82   ADAM - WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER 82

     He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book.    He
     knocks in a playful rhythm.

     JANE ANSWERS THE DOOR

     all smiles.

                          JANE
               Hey....


     REVERSE - ON ADAM

     Very happy to see her.

                          ADAM
               Hey.   You look fantastic.

                         JANE
               I'm feelin' a little fantastic.

     She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating
     a gi-normous piece of cake.

                         ADAM
                   (trying not to react to
                    that, ENTERS, handing her
                    the gift.)
               This is for you.

                          JANE
               Really? Thank you! Come on in.
                   (takes a huge bite of
                    cake)
               Can you hold this for a sec?
                   (hands him the cake plate)
               Oh my God...
                   (takes another bite)
               -- this could be the best cake I
               ever made. You want a piece? It's
               like... beyond...

                         ADAM
               I think I'm good.

                         JANE
                   (focusing on the gift)
               I can't believe you brought me a
               gift?! So nice!
                                                              85.



     Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.

                         JANE
               An appointment book?

                         ADAM
               I sort of assumed you didn't have
               one.

                         JANE
               --Because I never remember our...
               Awww....

                         ADAM
               I took the liberty of filling in
               our next two meetings. And marked
               them with post-its and wrote them
               in red and then highlighted them in
               neon yellow.

                            JANE
               Thank you!

     Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the
     kiss lands on his lips.

                            JANE
               Sorry.

                         ADAM
               I'm not.
                   (Did he really say that?
                    Then, he licks his lips)
               Wow, that cake is good.

     Jane laughs a little too hard.


83   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                          83
                         JANE
               So, let me ask you something and
               please don't think I'm weird or out
               of line or anything... but do you
               by any chance poke smot?                              
                            ADAM
               Do I...??

                         JANE
               I mean do you smoke pot?! I
               haven't asked anyone that question
               since I was twenty-two.
                                                         86.



                    ADAM
          Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But
          I don't think I've had any since my
          kids were born...so not in like 27
          years.

                    JANE
          Oh my God, we have kids the same
          age! And I haven't had any since
          my kids were born either!!! Except
          for tonight. I had one hit off of
          this.

Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up
next to a Police Car.

                     ADAM
          You might not want to hold that
          quite so...
              (nods)
          Hello Officer.

                    JANE
              (turns, SEES the Cop Car,
               GASPS and DROPS THE
               JOINT, then TURNS to Cop,
               waves, then:)                                   
          I actually know him! Blueberry
          scone and a latte.
              (the Cop nods, pulls away)
          Oh my God! That was horrifying. I
          instantly saw myself in a mug shot.
          My heart is leaping out of my...
              (then distracted)
          Wow... This is the most insane
          dashboard I've ever seen. It's like
          we're in a cockpit. It's
          spectacular. Adam, what kind of
          car is this?

                      ADAM
          Jane?

                      JANE
                (turns to him)
          Hi.

                    ADAM
          Did you get this high from one hit?
                                                               87.



                         JANE
               Yes! I don't know what they've                           
               done to pot over the last 30 years
               but it rockkkkks!                                        


84   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                    84
     From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room.
     Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples
     and College Kids are walking toward the house.

85   ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES                                85
     Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.   Jane takes a tiny, lady-
     like hit, passes it to Adam.

                         JANE
                   (whispers)
               Don't take too much, it's really
               strong.

     She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a
     huge hit.

                         ADAM
                   (while holding in the
                    smoke)
               I haven't had fun in almost three
               years, Jane.
                   (takes another huge hit)
               Bring. It. On.


     SOME COLLEGE KIDS

     walk past the bushes.

                         KID
               Who's got the reefer?                                    
                         ADAM (O.S.)
                   (fake falsetto)
               No one. Keep walking please.

     The Kids laugh.


86   INT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER            86
     Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
     party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.
                                                                 88.



                            JANE
                  How you feeling?

                            ADAM
                  Totally fine.

                            JANE
                  Me too.

     Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just
     insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them
     back with a huge hug.

                            JANE
                  Hi... love your dress.   Hey Harls.

                            HARLEY
                      (that's weird...)
                  Harls...?

                            JANE
                  Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and
                  her fiance, Harley.                                   
                      (giggles to Kids)
                  We're on a date.

     Adam and Jane stifle laughs.


87   AT THE BAR - WIDE - MOMENTS LATER                            87
     Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids.     Looks like it's going
     great -- Adam is a big hit.                                        
     ON JAKE - WATCHING FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

     Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. He sees the
     Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his
     move.

     ON JANE AND ADAM

     Now alone.    They haven't seen Jake yet.

                             ADAM
                      (starts moving to the                             
                       music - Jane laughs)                             
                  By the way -- How great is this
                  party? Let's be the last to leave.                    
                      (bops to the MUSIC then
                       SPOTS JAKE ACROSS THE
                       ROOM, seriously eyeing
                       him.)
                             (MORE)
                                                           89.
                    ADAM(cont'd)
          Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.                     
          He's headed right toward us. Not                       
          the time to be "feeling groovy"                        
              (dances again when he sees                         
               Jake in SLOW-MO getting                           
               closer and closer)
          Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?

Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who
looks inappropriately youthful.

                    JAKE
          Hello Jane.... Adam.

                    ADAM
              (all smiles)                                       
          Hey, good to see you again.

                    JANE
          Adam, this is Agness, Jake's
          wife...
              (suddenly realizing)
          Now that is an odd sentence for me
          to say since that was me for most
          of my life. Seriously. How weird
          is that? Both of us married to the
          same man!

                    AGNESS
              (dismissing the idea)
          You know... it's... hey, what are                      
          you gonna do?

                    JAKE
          Yeah, why go there.

At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the           
giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight          
face.                                                            
                    JANE
          Because there, is...fascinating. I
          mean, when you think about it, it
          sort of links us in some cosmic                        
          crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of                      
          all the men on the planet, we both
          said "I do" to this guy.

                    AGNESS
          Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I
          know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'
          moment, but I think I'm gonna get a
          refill. Adam, good meeting you.
                                                                 90.



                         ADAM
                   (whispers to Jane as                                 
                    Agness exits)                                       
               She's got a really scary tattoo.                         
                          JAKE
               Janey, can I talk to you for a
               quick sec?

     Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. Jane
     looks to Adam.                                                     
                         JANE
               He always needs me for a quick sec.
                   (starts to exit)                                     
               You okay?                                                
                         ADAM                                           
               Oh, I'm very okay!                                       


88   INT. TINY BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER                           88
     Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.

                         JAKE
               What's going on?    You're acting
               insane.

                         JANE
                   (whispers giddily)
               I'm stoned.

                         JAKE
               What?! You smoked the joint I gave
               you?

                         JANE
               You told me to!    It's a-mazing!!!

                         JAKE
               But you weren't supposed to smoke
               it with him, you're supposed to
               smoke it with me!

                         JANE
               Somebody's jealous....

                         JAKE
               Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I
               be... you're my...
                                                         91.



                     JANE
          -- What?   What am I, Jake?

                    JAKE
          You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest
          friend and girlfriend.

Jane blurts out a laugh.

                    JANE
          Okay. You're hilarious. And
          because of that, even though I kind
          of hate you/love you, I'm going to
          let you have some...

                    JAKE
          You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"
          had top billing, but...

Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands
it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY
ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks
him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught
between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.

                    HARLEY
          Oh my God, you're smoking weed in
          the guest bathroom.

                    JAKE
          Yes we are and we'd appreciate it
          if you didn't tell anyone about
          this.

                       HARLEY
          No. Never.     Adding it to the list.                  
                    JANE
          Care for a toke?

                    HARLEY
          I don't really smoke marijuana.

                     JANE
              (blowing out smoke)
          Me either.

                    HARLEY
          Okay, one hit.

                    JANE
              (looks at herself in the
               mirror)
                    (MORE)
                                                               92.
                         JANE(cont'd)
               Oh, my God. Is that what I look
               like?


89   EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER                          89
     A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio.           
     Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into         
     it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends         
     and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake              
     follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby      
     on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her.
     Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their            
     parents.

                         LAUREN
               They must be hammered.

                         HARLEY
               Or something like that.

     Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.

                         ADAM
                   (to Agness)
               Sweetest divorced couple in the
               world..!

     Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.

                         JANE
                   (spotting Adam)
               Hey..!
                   (to Jake)
               Jake, I'm gonna....                                      
     Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little
     as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice
     Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks        
     from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look
     back at Jake again.

     Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away.
     Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.


90   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                             90
     Adam drives Jane home.   Clearly the end of a great night.         
                         JANE
               Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?                        
                                                             93.



                         ADAM
               You know what's great?

                          JANE
               What?

                         ADAM
               How much I like you.

                         JANE
                   (really touched)
               Thank you... I really like you a
               lot too.... even though...oh.. you                     
               didn't say, "a lot".

                         ADAM
               But I was thinking it.

                         JANE
               So... I'm not too old for you?

                         ADAM
               How can you be too old for me when
               I'm older than you.

                         JANE
               I just figured all these women you
               get fixed up with are thirty-five.

                         ADAM
               Your age is one of my favorite
               things about you.
                   (she appreciates that)
               Do you think you have any more of
               that chocolate cake at your house?                     
                          JANE
               Hungry?

                          ADAM
               Starved!


91   A BLACK SCREEN - LIGHTS POP ON                             91
     And we are IN THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few
     more lights, but keeps it a bit moody.

                         ADAM
               Officially now the best date of my
               life. Pre or post divorce.
                                                                94.



                         JANE
               Get out... All right....so
               basically I can make you anything
               on the menu or even not on the
               menu. Just name it.

                          ADAM
               No?  Really? Okay.                                      
                   (scans the blackboard                               
                    menu)                                              
               What about a... warm chocolate
               croissant?

                         JANE
               My speciality!


92   OMIT                                                        92    



     INT. BAKERY KITCHEN                                               
     JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an          
     apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then places the           
     dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into        
     the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter.

     ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS

     watching the sheeter, mesmerized.

     NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard      
     stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the           
     sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts       
     it into triangles. She's a whiz at this.                          
     THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of             
     dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,         
     Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each         
     triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they           
     work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.       


93   INT. RESTAURANT - LATER                                     93
     Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of
     croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam
     takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.
                                                     95.



                    ADAM
              (bites into it)
          Oh. Baby.

                    JANE
              (smelling hers)
          Mmmmmmmm.

                    ADAM
          It's crazy how good this is.

                    JANE
              (biting into one, nods)
          Yeah, and I'm not even stoned
          anymore.

                    ADAM
          Neither am I.

                    JANE
              (happy about that)
          Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.

                    ADAM
          Do you remember when I asked you
          the other night, if you were dating
          anyone and you said no... It
          sounded to me like you were maybe
          saying yes.

                    JANE
          I was sort of seeing someone.     But,
          it's over now.
              (Adam nods)
          Honestly.

                    ADAM
          `Cause I'm not strong enough to
          fall for someone who's with someone
          else. Wouldn't be able to take
          that again.

                    JANE
          I understand. I wouldn't say it
          was over if it wasn't.

Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.

                    ADAM
          Great.                                           
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit
quizzically.
                                                              96.



                            JANE
                      (explains)
                  Cooking scar.... From a very hot
                  batch of caramel...

                            ADAM
                  Ooooo. What about that one?

                             JANE
                  That one's from boiling sugar...I
                  wasn't very skilled in the
                  beginning.    And that one is from a
                  large French...

     Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.

                            JANE
                  -- Saute pan.

     Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
     her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
     Adam moves closer.

                            ADAM
                  Would it be okay if I...?

     Jane nods.    He kisses her great.

                            ADAM
                  I was going to say, kiss you.

                               JANE
                  I figured.

                            ADAM
                  If you feel this is in any way
                  wrong because we're working
                  together...

                            JANE
                  ... I don't ...

     He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and
     kiss again.


94   OMIT                                                         94    
                                                            97.




INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY                                
Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be      
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt      
and boxers.                                                       
                    JANE
          Hey sleepy! What time did you get
          in?

                    LUKE
          Have no idea. Lauren and Harley
          drove me home.

                    LAUREN
              (joining)
          I'm surprised you remember that.

                    JANE
              (turns to see Lauren)
          Hi. I didn't know you slept here.

Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.

                    LAUREN
          We were playing Scattagories with
          Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell                        
          asleep on the couch.

Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.

                    LUKE
          Sweet.

                    HARLEY
          I got cold in the middle of the
          night.

Lauren and Jane laugh.

                     JANE
          Okay, who wants what?
              (noticing Gabby entering)                           
          Hi baby...                                              
                    GABBY                                         
              (looks out the front                                
               window)                                            
          What's Dad doing here?                                  
                                                              98.



     Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his
     Porsche.


96   EXT. FRONT PORCH                                             96
     Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's
     had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane
     cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
     all open.

                         JANE
                   (quietly)
               Everything okay?

                         JAKE
               I left Agness.

                         JANE
               No, don't say that.

                         JAKE
               She saw it my eyes, Janey.

                           JANE                                         
               Saw what?

                         JAKE
               That I'm still in love with you.   I
               admitted it, I told her about us
               and I've left her. For you.

                         JANE
               No, no, no.... What do you mean???
               Jake, this is crazy!
                   (worried the kids will
                    hear, whispers)
               Are you telling me the truth?

                          JAKE
                   (nods)
               This feels so right Jane.

     As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her          
     PJ's, looking confused.

                         GABBY                                          
                   (from the porch)
               What's going on?

                         JANE
               Nothing. Honey, set the table,
               I'll be right in.
                                                            99.



                       GABBY                                      
             Mom, you're the only one who cares
             if the table's set.

                        JANE
             Okay, then do it for me....just go
             in please.

Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.                          
                       LUKE
             What's up, Dad?

                       JAKE
             Having some problems on the home
             front, just wanted to talk to your
             Mom for a sec.

Jane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley
joins the Kids.                                                   
                       LAUREN
             Problems on the home front?   Is one
             of you seeing someone else?

Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right       
back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.

                       JAKE
                 (off Jane's cue)
             No, it's nothing like that. I just
             need to find a hotel or something
             for a few days `til I get my head
             together.

                       GABBY                                      
             It's that serious?

Jake nods.

                       LUKE
             Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
             days? He can share my room.

                       JANE
             I don't think that's the best idea,
             Luke.

                       GABBY                                      
             Daddy, are you crying?
                                                              100.




93   ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP                                 93
     He turns away from the kids.   The tears could be for dramatic
     effect, could be real.

                            JAKE
               I'm sorry.

     All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane.

                         LUKE
                   (begging)
               Mom........


97   EXT. FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER              97     
     Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits
     silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French
     Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been
     lifted. His energy is in full bloom.

                         JAKE
               Mommy's the best cook in the world!


98   EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - LATER THAT DAY                     98
     Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.    She
     looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking
     across his face.

                         JAKE
               Thank you for saving me Janey.

                         JANE
               Jake, you knew the kids were all
               here. Shouldn't we have talked
               about this? Agreed this was the
               right thing to do? This is so
               typical. Only thinking about works
               for you.

                         JAKE
               I'm sorry, I guess I should've
               called before showing up.

                         JANE
               -- And I'm not sure you even left
               Agness. Maybe she saw something
               last night and threw you out...
                                                         101.



                    JAKE
          What's the difference? I was
          drowning over there. I'm not going
          to get that many more chances in my
          life to figure myself out. Janey,
          let's use these couple of days to
          see if we can make this work.

                    JANE
          We can't, Jake. I told you this
          the other night. Please listen.

                     JAKE
          But you were all pissy because you
          thought I stood you up. Things are
          different now. I'm a free man.
              (then)
          Can we just hug? I hate that
          you're being so distant. It's
          literally giving me a pain in my
          stomach.

                       JANE
          Oh, God...

Jane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her.

                      JANE
          See!    Too much!

                      JAKE
          Okay!    Good note.

Jane can't help but smile.

                    JAKE
          Can I help with what you're doing?
          Hold your basket or...

                    JANE
          I'm fine....

                    JAKE
          Okay... I'm going to go to the
          video store and get us all a dvd to
          watch tonight. We'll have movie
          night. Just like old times. How's
          that? I'll make the popcorn.                          
Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.
                                                                 102.



                          JANE
                Fine.
                    (into phone)
                Hello...

                          JAKE
                    (whispers)
                I love knowing I'm coming back
                here.

                           JANE
                     (nods, turning slightly)
                Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout
                you?

      Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.


99    INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT                 99
      The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low.
      Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits
      in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids
      are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands
      them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls.


      ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN

                          BUCK HENERY
                Are you here for an affair, sir?

                          DUSTIN
                What?

                          BUCK HENRY
                The Singleman party, sir?

      Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake
      snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing.
      He catches Jane's eye and mouths.

                          JAKE
                I'M SO HAPPY!!!


100   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST.                 100
                                                              103.




101   INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                   101
      Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to
      the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the    
      fridge.

                          JAKE
                Any leftovers?

                          GABBY                                        
                Are you kidding?
                    (takes out an armful of
                     Tupperware)

                          JAKE
                Any of that noodle thing left?
                    (Gabby hands it to him.)                           
                Where's Mom? She disappeared so
                fast after the movie.

                          GABBY                                        
                She's probably sleeping.

                          LUKE
                I think she's on her computer.

      They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various
      counters.

                          LUKE
                Tonight was weird.

                          GABBY                                        
                So weird. Still is.

                          JAKE
                I loved tonight.

                          GABBY                                        
                Yeah. That's why it was so weird.
                Just seeing you in your robe in our
                kitchen. Remember when you weren't
                even allowed in. Mom used to go out
                to the car to talk to you...

                          LUKE
                    (handing Gabby his                                 
                     Tupperware)
                You know, I don't even really
                remember you and Mom as a couple.
                                                         104.



                    JAKE
          What do you mean... you were ten
          when we broke up.

                    LUKE
          I was eight actually and I don't
          know...it's all foggy to me now.

                    JAKE
          You don't remember us in Hawaii or
          all sleeping in that tent in the
          backyard.

                    LUKE
          Yeah, of course, but I don't
          remember like you and Mom hugging
          or waking up together...

Jake grabs his heart, moans.

                     LUKE
          -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or
          anything. You've been good
          parents...

                    GABBY                                       
          Speak for yourself dude. I'm
          definitely damaged from the
          divorce.

Harley and Lauren ENTER.   Lauren turns the tea kettle on.

                    LAUREN
          Hello troops.

                    JAKE
          Why are you still here?

                    LAUREN
          I don't know, you and Mom sleeping
          in the same house. Harley thought
          we should stay.

Jake turns his beams on Harley.

                    HARLEY
          She exaggerates. I just thought
          perhaps you might want to talk
          later, or ... Is that the noodle
          thing?

                    JAKE
          Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.
                                                               105.



                          GABBY                                          
                Dad!

                          JAKE
                I didn't know anyone wanted any.


102   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER                        102
      Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her
      LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.

                          JANE
                Wait, I can't see that one.    Can
                you back up a little?

      CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM

      He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski
      sweater.

                           JANE
                    (hmmm)
                Very festive...

                          ADAM
                O-kay. Thank you.
                    (into lens)
                Gift from my ex-sister-in-law.
                Have no idea why I kept it.
                    (pulls sweater off)
                Into the pile. Hey, check out the
                pile, Jane.

      Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF
      OLD CLOTHES.

                           JANE
                Nice!
                    (then)
                Hey, the pile's moving....

                          ADAM
                Murphy, get out of there!

      A small Mutt scurries out of the pile.   Jane laughs.              
                          ADAM
                    (re-enters in an odd
                     shirt)
                What about this?   I was in India
                and I had it made.
                          (MORE)
                                                        106.
                    ADAM(cont'd)
          The guy ran out of fabric so he
          didn't make me long sleeves.
              (looks down)
          Or short sleeves. It's weird.

                    JANE
          And kinda girly.

                    ADAM
              (taking it off)
          Not what I'm going for.
              (holds up a sweater)                             
          Gray sweater. Very old.                              
                       JANE
          But cute.

                    ADAM
              (slips it on)
          You sure? You don't have to say you
          like it just because you nixed the
          last 20 things.

Jane likes this man.

                    JANE
          Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have
          a lot of clothes.

                    ADAM
              (looks at the floor)
          Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're
          almost done. You are helping me so
          much by the way.

                    JANE
          -- Adam, I really have to pee.

                     ADAM
          Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in
          thirty....
              (lifting the laptop)
          Putting this on my desk....

ON JANE'S SIDE

Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed.

                    JANE'S VOICE
          I'm not in there...

ON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR.
                                                                  107.



                           ADAM'S VOICE
                 Can't hear you.


103    INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME                      103
       Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the
       room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly,
       quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS      
       HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
       elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
       changes his smile to a smoulder.

       Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags
       over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of
       his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.


       JANE                                                               

A104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink.                      A104    


104    INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                             104
       Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop.

105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105

       Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT
       HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.

                           ADAM
                 Mother of --
                     (looks again)
                 Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

       Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,    SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE
       AND SCREAMS BACK.

                           JANE
                 What are you doing in here?!!!

                           ADAM
                     (covering the screen with
                      his hands)
                 Get it off!!!

                           JAKE
                     (covering himself)
                 I wanted to see you.
                                                        108.



                    JANE
          Why are you naked!?!

                    JAKE
              (sits up straight, the lap
               top shooting even more
               directly at his groin)
          Why do you think?

                    ADAM
          Okay, I'm gonna be sick.

Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
course, does nothing.

                    ADAM
          Not working! Big close up!

Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to
get his robe.

                     ADAM
          Okay!   Good night!

Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE.
Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything.
She's desperate. He's lost.

The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his
robe.

                    GABBY                                       
          Everybody okay?

No one says anything.

                    LAUREN
          What's happening?

Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.

                    JAKE
          Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
          left Agness wasn't just because my
          marriage wasn't working.
              (The Kids wait...)
          I've also fallen in love...back in
          love... with your mother. Or maybe
          I never stopped loving her.

                    GABBY                                       
          Is this a joke?                                       
                                                                109.



                          JAKE
                I know this is shocking, but I
                think this is the best thing that's
                ever happened to me. Your Mom and
                I have been seeing each other, on
                the side... ever since New York.

                          LAUREN                                        
                Mom, is this true?

                          JANE
                    (dying)
                That part is, but..

                          JAKE
                I found my way back home.     I just
                hope she'll take me back.

      Gabby breaks down in tears.    Lauren puts her arm around her.    
      Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A
      CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.

                          JAKE
                Why's everyone crying?     Why isn't
                this good news?

                          LAUREN                                        
                Because we're still getting over                        
                the divorce.                                            
                          LUKE
                Mom, are you and Dad getting back
                together?

                          JANE
                No... we're not.

      Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness.


106   EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER - THAT NIGHT                         106
      The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the
      house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before
      feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his
      bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say.
      Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back
      inside.

108   EXT. POOL AREA/BACKYARD - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT               108
      Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in
      hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter
      shut, we drift off of her...                                       
                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

123   EXT. JANE'S POOL/BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING                   123
      CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool          
      chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off          
      and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes          
      she's spent the night outside.

      Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly             
      realizes what she must do.                                         


124   A FRONT DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL HARLEY                         124
      bed-headed and still in his pj's. He approvingly looks at
      Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.

                          HARLEY
                Glad you're here, boss.


125   INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS                                   125
      Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.

                          HARLEY                                         
                Now I know you don't need my advice                      
                Jane, but...                                             
                          JANE                                           
                I got this one...                                        
                          HARLEY                                         
                I know you do.                                           
      Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside.                     

      JANE'S POV - INSIDE THE BEDROOM

      Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby       
      and Luke. They look like they just woke up.
                                                      111.


Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
her children.

                    JANE
          Knowing how to be divorced is next
          to impossible... and sometimes over
          the years, I've thought that your
          Dad and I weren't quite finished.
          And, as it turns out, we weren't.
          So I went out of my comfort zone,
          which, I found out, if you're
          really honest with yourself, isn't
          all that comforting. So, I
          experimented with a part of myself.
          I wanted to find out if, after all
          these years there was still
          something there between us.

                    LAUREN
          And was there?

                    JANE
          There kinda was.

Lauren smiles with her eyes.

                    GABBY                                      
          But Mom, you have to understand how
          bonkers this sounds to us. For two
          people who for years couldn't be in
          the same room together...to then
          have an affair??? You and Dad...!

                    JANE
          I know...it was hard for me and I
          was doing it. I hope you'll
          forgive me for confusing you or
          betraying your trust, but I did
          this for me and for him and I
          realized even though your Dad and I
          once had something extraordinary...
          we no longer really fit together.
          But he is a part of me and always
          will be.

                    LUKE
          So it's over now? You guys are
          back to being divorced.

                    JANE
          For better or for worse.
                                                                112.



      Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on
      the other side of the bed, holding back tears.

                             HARLEY
                Group hug?

      And as they all move into hug, we:

126   A MOVING POV - INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY              126
      REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.    She arrives at:

127   ADAM'S OFFICE                                              127
      Adam is on a phone call.

                           ADAM
                    (into phone)
                Yeah no problem...we can definitely
                do that...
                    (notices Jane)
                -- James, can I call you back,
                someone just... Thanks.
                    (rises)
                Hi.

                          JANE
                Hi. May I come in?

                             ADAM
                -- Sure.

                          JANE
                I didn't call you last night                             
                because I wasn't sure you would
                take the call and then I thought
                that could go on for months and...                       
                          ADAM
                -- I would have taken the call.

                          JANE
                Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
                say these things in person. Adam,
                the man I was seeing was...

                          ADAM
                I think I'm up to speed on that
                part.
                                                  113.



                    JANE
          I want you to know it didn't last
          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...

                    ADAM
          -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...

                    JANE
          I told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...

                    ADAM
          -- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.

                     JANE
          Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.

Adam smiles.

                    JANE
          Please tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...

                    ADAM
          I was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.

                    JANE
          Oh... I hope you don't...

                     ADAM
          Thanks.
                                                             114.

129   EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY                    129
      Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.

      Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.

                             JAKE
                I'm sorry.

      Jane doesn't answer right away.

                          JANE
                How far back does that sorry go?

                          JAKE
                How far back do you need it to go?

                             JANE
                Way back.

                          JAKE
                Consider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.

                           JANE
                Yeah, what were you thinking with
                that move?

                          JAKE
                That you'd find me irresistible.

      Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.

                          JAKE
                Never considered the alternative.

                          JANE
                Gotta love that about you.

      They swing some more.
                                        115.



          JAKE
Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.

          JANE
You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.

          JAKE
And you don't think we could make
it right?                                      
          JANE
Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?                      
          JAKE
Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.

           JANE
But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?                                     
          JAKE
It was complicated.

          JANE
Begging for an answer.

          JAKE
I thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.

          JANE
Guess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.

          JAKE
Do you always have to be so hard on
me?

           JANE
No.   I don't.

          JAKE
I don't regret giving it another
shot.
                                                               116.



                          JANE
                Probably would've been better if
                you hadn't been married.

                          JAKE
                It may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.

      Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.                               
                          JANE
                I don't regret it either.

      They continue rocking, not much more to say.   As CAMERA PULLS     
      AWAY, we:

130   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER                     130
      It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
      is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.

      Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
      GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift          
      tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to           
      face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is              
      stunned he's there.                                                
                          ADAM
                Good morning.

                          JANE
                Good morning.

                          ADAM
                Did you know it's good luck to
                start building in the rain?

                          JANE
                Really?

                          ADAM
                    (obviously lying)
                Yes. It's a well known, very good,
                really lucky omen.

      Thunder rattles the sky.
                                                          117.



                     JANE
              (looking up)
          Good, I could use one.
              (then)
          Would you all like to have your
          meeting in the house...it's dry and
          I've got hot coffee...

The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.

                    ADAM                                         
          Jane, I need to ask you                                
          something...                                           
                    JANE                                         
          Anything...                                            
                     ADAM                                        
          You wouldn't happen to have any of                     
          those amazing chocolate croissants,
          would you?

                    JANE                                         
          Oh.... you like those, huh?                            
                    ADAM                                         
          I have incredibly fond memories of                     
          them.                                                  
                    JANE                                         
          I don't have any here, but we could                    
          go into town and get some... right                     
          out of the oven.                                       
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:           
                    ADAM                                         
          You want to do that?                                   
                    JANE                                         
          Yeah... love to.                                       
And as they walk away from Camera, we: 
                          
                                          SLOWLY FADE OUT

          EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
          belongings over her shoulder.
                         
          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
                         
          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
                         
          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
                         
                         
          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
                         
          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
          approaching coach. She flags it down.
                         
          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
          indicates she can get in.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
          the day, she closes her eyes.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.
                         
          Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
          meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
          With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
                         
          She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
          moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
          at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
          puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
          not there.
                         
          She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
          towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
          alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
                         
          She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
          gathering dark.

          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
          night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
          is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
          She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
          crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
          fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
          her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
          side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
                         
          Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
          sits up. She is alone.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
                         
          Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
          sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
          stones. Jane makes no movement.
                         
          A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
          with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
          bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
          the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.
                         
          It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
          farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould
          of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She
          eats it ravenously.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.
                         
          It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She
          is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 3.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.
                         
          The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
          at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
                         
          She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
          walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
          looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.
                         
          Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
          struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
                         
          She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
          against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
          point of despair.
                         
          The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
          Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
          shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
                         
                         
          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.
                         
          Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
          light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
          shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
          the gate.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
          she peers through a window.
                         
          On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
          They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
          black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
          her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
          young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
          They are talking intimately.
                         
          They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
          that it pains Jane considerably.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers.
          She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.
                         
                          HANNAH
           What do you want?
                         
          Jane manages to find her voice.

                          HANNAH
           I can't take in vagrants. Here's
           a penny. Now take it and go.
                         
                          JANE
           I have no strength to go.
                         
                          HANNAH
           You can move off. And if there
           are others with you tell them we
           are not alone. We have a
           gentleman here, and dogs.
                         
                          JANE
                          (DESPERATE)
           But I must die if I am turned
           away.
                         
          The door slams shut. Jane lets out a hopeless wail.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           God help me. I will die.
                         
          She turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds
          herself supported by a strong pair of black-clad arms.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           All of God's creatures must die.
           But not prematurely - and not on
           my doorstep I hope.
                         
          Jane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face
          of the handsomest man she has ever seen; St John Rivers. He
          lifts her over the threshold into the warmth of Moor House.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN.
                         
          A fire is roaring in the stove. Hannah is bent over it.
                         
                          HANNAH
           We've had a beggar woman come, Mr
           Rivers. I sent her - For shame!
                         
          Hannah falls silent as she sees Jane.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You did your duty in excluding
           her. Let me do mine in admitting
           her.
                         
          He sets Jane down before the hearth. She can barely stand.
          She is soaked to the bone, filthy with mud. Her skin has a
          ghastly pallor. Diana and Mary enter.

           I don't know; I found her at the
           door.
                         
                          HANNAH
                          (GUILTILY)
           I thought her one of the gypsies

          Jane can hold herself up no longer. Diana moves forward.
          She and St John catch Jane and help her into a chair. The
          rain hammers on the windows.
                         
                          DIANA
           Hannah, some water.
                         
                          MARY
           She's worn to nothing. She looks
           like a spectre. St John, if you
           hadn't taken her in, we would
           have fallen upon her dead body in
           the morning.
                         
                          DIANA
           Mary.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           She's no vagrant; I'm sure of it.
                         
                          HANNAH
           There's milk and bread for you.
                         
          Jane tries to mouth her thanks. She sips the milk. Eats a
          mouthful of bread. Diana kneels at her side.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Ask her her name.
                         
                          JANE
           I - I am J -
                         
          Jane cannot speak. She's incapable of uttering her own
          name. She hears John Reed's voice calling from far away.
                         
                          JOHN REED
           Jane Eyre!
                         
                          DIANA
           Please, tell us how we may help
           you.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Can we send for anyone? Who are
           your people?
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6.
                         
                         
          The questions are deeply troubling to Jane. She is losing
          consciousness.
                         
          She sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away
          through a great darkening room. Jane tries to follow her.
          The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair.
                         
          She hears John Reed's voice again.
                         
           JOHN REED (V.O.)
           Jane Eyre! Where are you?
                         
          Jane, panicked, looking for somewhere to hide, passes out.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - A GRAND RECEPTION ROOM.
                         
          Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking
          hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.
                         
          She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen
          year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He
          is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.
                         
                          JOHN REED
           Come out, rat. I know you are in
           here. Come out now and I won't
           punish you.
                         
          Jane watches him pass by her. He practises a perfect lunge.
                         
           JOHN REED (CONT'D)
           Rat.
                         
          He exits. Jane breathes a sigh of relief. She slowly pulls
          the curtain across, making the window a private sanctuary.
          There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane is sitting cross-legged, completely absorbed in her
          book - a beautifully drawn picture of a cormorant. She runs
          her finger over it. We hear the sound of great waves
          plunging on to a shore.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. AN ARCTIC COAST.
                         
          Jane, aged ten, is sitting cross-legged on an isolated
          rock, her eyes locked with those of a stooping black
          cormorant. St John's voice comes from a long way away.
                         
           ST JOHN (V.O.)
           Diana, Mary help me get her
           upstairs...
                         
          The cormorant raises its wings like a great black cloak.
          Jane watches as it takes off and flies away.

          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE WINDOW SEAT.
                         
          Jane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
          Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in
          front of her. Jane shrinks back.
                         
                          JOHN REED
           I have been looking for you these
           last ten minutes.
                         
                          JANE
           What do you want?
                         
                          JOHN REED
           Say forgive me, Master Reed.
                         
                          JANE
           I have done nothing wrong. Master
           Reed.
                         
          John grabs the book.
                         
                          JOHN REED
           Who gave you permission to read
           my book?
                         
                          JANE
           I wasn't aware it was yours.
                         
                          JOHN REED
           Everything in this house is mine.
           You're lucky to live here with
           gentleman's children like us.
           Your father had nothing. You
           should go and beg.
                         
          Jane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts
          her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp,
          drawing blood. She is shocked.
                         
           JOHN REED (CONT'D)
           That's for the look you had on
           your face. You bad animal.
                         
          Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her
          released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way
          she can. She is barely coherent.
                         
                          JANE
           Wicked and cruel - you are a
           slaver - a murderer -
                         
                          JOHN
           I shall tell mother -
                         
                          JANE
           I hate you John Reed. I hate you -
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8.
                         
                         
          John is flabbergasted. Like all bullies, he is terrified.
                         
                          JOHN
           Mamma! Mamma! There's a rat! Rat!
                         
          Jane bites him. Hard. At that moment, Mrs Reed appears on
          the scene. John screams. We see Mrs Reed's shocked face.
          She is an overweight woman pushing forty in a bright,
          elaborate dress.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM
                         
          Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes
          off; one at each side of her. Jane is distressed,
          approaching a delirium. She resists them.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.
                         
          Jane is carried in and set down on a footstool by two
          servants, Miss Abbot and Bessie - one at each side of her.
          She is still resisting.
                         
                          BESSIE
           For shame, hitting your master.
                         
                          MISS ABBOT
           If you don't sit still you must
           be tied down!
                         
          The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,
          young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She
          has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.
                         
                          BESSIE
           What we do is for your own good.
           If you are passionate and rude
           like this, your Aunt Reed will
           send you away.
                         
                          MISS ABBOT
           You're worse than us servants. We
           work for our keep; you do
           nothing. Pray for forgiveness
           Miss Eyre or something bad will
           come down that chimney and fetch
           you away.
                         
          The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge
          of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
          curtains, murky in the fading light.
                         
          In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
          Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale
          reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on
          pillars of mahogany, hung with red.
           Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 9.
                         
                         
          The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white.
          Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
                         
          A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
          fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
          the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
          pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
          the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
          her eyes glittering with fear.
                         
          It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
          grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
          She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
          ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
                         
          Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
          shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
          surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking
          glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally
          rips from Jane's throat.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE FIRESIDE.
                         
          At the sound of the scream, Mrs Reed, slumbering, almost
          jumps out of her skin.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE KITCHEN.
                         
          Miss Abbott almost drops the tea tray she is carrying.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - A CORRIDOR.
                         
          Jane is banging on the door, screaming, hysterical with
          terror. Bessie rushes to the door and unlocks it. Jane
          flies into her arms.
                         
                          BESSIE
           Miss Eyre what is it?
                         
                          JANE
           Bessie!
                         
                          BESSIE
           Have you seen something?
                         
                          JANE
           There was a light.
                         
          We see Bessie's own fear as she glances into the dark room.
          Mrs Reed is storming towards them, furious.
                         
                          MRS REED
           Bessie, I gave orders that she
           was to be left in the red room
           until I came.

                          BESSIE
           But she screamed so loud ma'am.
                         
                          MRS REED
           It is play-acting. Let her go. I
           know your tricks Jane Eyre and I
           abhor such artifice. Loose
           Bessie's hands, child.
                         
          Mrs Reed prises Jane away from Bessie as she speaks.
                         
           MRS REED (CONT'D)
           You will now stay here an hour
           longer.
                         
                          JANE
           No - Aunt, have pity -
                         
                          MRS REED
           And only when you are perfectly
           submissive will I let you out.
                         
                          JANE
           Please - I cannot bear it -
                         
                          MRS REED
           Silence. This violence is
           repulsive.
                         
                          JANE
           I shall be killed -
                         
                          MRS REED
           Get back!
                         
                          JANE
           Have mercy, have mercy I beg you -
                         
          Mrs Reed throws her back into the room, slams the door and
          turns the key. We hear Jane's unspeakable howls of terror,
          her anguished bangs upon the door.
                         
          Bessie is looking at Mrs Reed aghast. Mrs Reed withers her
          with a frozen glare.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.
                         
          We see Jane in her distress, hitting her head on the door.
          She falls back. On the floor, her arms and legs move beyond
          her control. She is having a fit. When it is over, we see
          Jane unconscious. She is lying in a pool of ghostly light.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM.
                         
          Through the light, Jane sees Mary and Diana Rivers at her
          side.

                          MARY
           She's awake.
                         
          St John approaches in his parson's collar, blocking out the
          light as he looks down. Jane gazes at him remotely.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I'm sure we'll find she's simply
           had a misunderstanding with her
           people. I hope she's not done
           anything deplorable; there's
           nothing so sad as a fallen young
           woman.
                         
                          MARY
           Look at the suffering in her
           eyes. They're like dark pools -
                         
          Diana smiles at Mary's tendency to over-dramatise.
                         
                          DIANA
           She has a peculiar face; I rather
           like it.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           She's not at all handsome.
                         
                          DIANA
           She's so ill, St John.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Ill or well, she'll always be
           plain.
                         
          Jane's eyes slide away from him and close.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM.
                         
          A bright morning. A huge clergyman dressed in black is
          staring down at Jane, blocking out the sun. We see him from
          her POV; his expansive chest, dramatic facial hair, huge
          flared nostrils, frowning brows. He is Brockelhurst, the
          epitome of grim.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           There is no sight so sad and so
           deplorable as that of a wicked
           little girl. Do you know, Jane
           Eyre, where the wicked go after
           death?
                         
                          JANE
           They go to hell.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           And what is hell, can you tell me
           that?
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 12.
                         
                         
                          JANE
           A pit full of fire.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           And should you like to fall into
           that pit and be burning there
           forever?
                         
                          JANE
           No sir.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           What must you do to avoid it?
                         
                          JANE
           I must keep in good health and
           not die.
                         
          Mrs Reed is by the fireside in an ultra-feminine dress. She
          puts down her tea cup in irritation.
                         
                          MRS REED
           I've been her sole benefactress
           and her kindest friend. But she
           shows no gratitude and brings
           nothing but discord into my
           house.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           What is her parentage?
                         
                          MRS REED
           She's an orphan. Her mother was my
           late husband's sister. On his
           deathbed he exhorted me to care for
           her. I have always treated her as
           one of my own.
                         
          Jane silently revolts against this lie.
                         
           MRS REED (CONT'D)
           If you accept her at Lowood school
           Mr Brocklehurst, keep a strict eye
           on her. Her worst fault is a
           tendency to deceit. I'm sorry to
           tell you that Jane Eyre is a liar.
                         
          Jane's eyes flash with outrage.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           All liars will have their portion
           in the lake burning with fire and
           brimstone. She shall be watched,
           Mrs Reed.
                         
                          MRS REED
           I wish her to be made useful, to
           be kept humble.

                          BROCKLEHURST
           You can rest assured dear lady
           that we mortify our girls in the
           sentiments of vanity and pride.
           They are taught to be quiet,
           plain and modest.
                         
          A passion of resentment is forming in Jane.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
           We shall root out the wickedness
           in this small, ungrateful plant.
                         
          Mrs Reed smiles sweetly.
                         
                          MRS REED
           And as for its vacations, it must
           spend them all at Lowood.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE ENTRANCE HALL.
                         
          Jane is climbing the staircase. John Reed blocks her way.
                         
                          JOHN
           So, Rat, you're being sent away.
           It's as I thought; you're not fit
           to associate with me.
                         
          Jane snaps. She cries out:
                         
                          JANE
           You are not fit to associate with
           me!
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE MORNING ROOM.
                         
          Mrs Reed is at her desk. Jane appears in front of her.
                         
                          JANE
           You said I was a liar. Well I am
           not. If I was, I should say that I
           loved you and I don't. I dislike
           you the worst of anybody in the
           world except John Reed. He is a
           liar, not I.
                         
                          MRS REED
           How dare you speak in this manner.
                         
                          JANE
           I'll never call you Aunt again as
           long as I live and if anyone asks
           how I liked you I'll say that the
           very thought of you makes me sick.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 14.
                         
                         
                          MRS REED
           You wouldn't dare.
                         
                          JANE
           I'll remember how you thrust me
           back into the Red Room and locked
           me there to my dying day. Even
           when you knew it was haunted and I
           begged to be let out. People think
           you are good but you are bad and
           hard-hearted and I'll let everyone
           at Lowood know what you have done!
                         
                          MRS REED
           Children must be corrected for
           their faults.
                         
                          JANE
           Deceit is not my fault!
                         
                          MRS REED
           But you are passionate.
                         
                          JANE
           My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can
           see all that you do and think; so
           can my mother and father. They know
           how you hate me and wish me dead.
           They can see. They see everything
           you do and they will judge you, Mrs
           Reed.
                         
          Mrs Reed has turned quite pale. Jane blazes with victory.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE GATE HOUSE.
                         
          Bessie is waiting with Jane while her belongings are loaded
          onto a public coach, its top laden with passengers.
                         
                          BESSIE
           You're such a queer, solitary
           little thing. If only you could
           make yourself more appealing.
           Perhaps if you tried smiling from
           time to time, people would find
           you more pleasant -
                         
                          JANE
           Don't scold me Bessie. I know you
           dislike me -
                         
                          BESSIE
           I don't dislike you Miss; I'm
           fonder of you than of anyone.
                         
                          JANE
           You don't show it.

           Miss Jane -
                         
          Jane throws her arms around Bessie and embraces her with
          great force. Bessie returns the embrace, surprised, moved.
          Jane gets into the coach. Bessie looks up at the driver.
                         
                          BESSIE (CONT'D)
           You take good care of her.
                         
          Jane's small, pale face peers out of the coach window,
          watching Gateshead recede. She doesn't cry. But Bessie
          can't stave off her tears.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - THE HALL.
                         
          Jane, half asleep is carried out of a coach and into a
          howling gale. She is taken under a stone inscription:
          `Lowood Institution'. She is set down in front of a woman
          with striking features and intelligent eyes; Miss Temple.
          She bends down and looks into Jane's face.
                         
                          MISS TEMPLE
           What's your name, child?
                         
                          JANE
           Jane Eyre.
                         
                          MISS TEMPLE
           You are very young to be sent
           alone, Jane Eyre.
                         
          She gently touches Jane's cheek with her finger. Jane
          manages the ghost of a smile.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - A BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane is lying back against clean white pillows. Her hair
          brushed and neatly plaited. Diana and Mary are full of
          kindness but St John's face is cold, dispassionate.
                         
                          JANE
           My name is Jane Elliott...

           Where do you come from, Miss
           Elliott?
                         
          Jane gives no answer.

           No one.
                         
          There is an intake of breath from Mary.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Do you mean to say that you are
           absolutely without home and
           without friends?
                         
                          JANE
           Yes sir.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           How did you come to be roaming

                          DIANA
           Don't upset her, St John. She
           must not be interrogated so.
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rivers, you and you sisters
           have done me a great service, the
           greatest man can do - you have
           rescued me from death.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           How are we to help you if we know
           nothing about you?
                         
                          JANE
           I'll tell you as much as I can. I
           am an orphan; brought up a
           dependent; educated in a charity
           school where I passed six years
           as a pupil and two as a teacher.
           I left a year since to become a

                          JANE
           A good situation, where I
           remained until...
                         
                          MARY
           Diana, didn't I say so? Didn't I
           say she was a governess?
                         
                          DIANA
           We did wonder. We mean no offence
           but you have a certain look. Mary
           and I work as governesses too.

           Do you?
                         
                          MARY
           We are currently trying to teach
           ourselves German, so we may find
           better positions.
                         
                          JANE
           You're not working at present?
                         
                          DIANA
           We came home only for our
           father's funeral.
                         
                          MARY
           He died three weeks ago.
                         
                          JANE
           I am very sorry to hear it.
                         
          St John has no patience with the change of subject.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why did you leave your place of
           employment?
                         
          Jane sinks back in the pillows.
                         
                          JANE
           I... It was a catastrophe.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           What did you do?
                         
                          JANE
           I am free from any blame, sir. I
           was happy.
                         
          Jane is deeply distressed.
                         
                          DIANA
           That's enough for now, St John.
                         
                          MARY
           You must rest, Miss Elliott.
                         
          The name sounds strange to Jane.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why did you start?
                         
                          JANE
           Because that is not my name.

           You haven't given us your real
           name?
                         
          Jane shakes her head.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why not?
                         
                          JANE
           Because I must not ever be found.
                         
          Diana and Mary glance at each other, fascinated.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE BEDROOM
                         
          Jane is dressing herself. She stops, weakly holding the
          back of a chair for support, looking out of the window at
          the sun setting over the hills.
                         
           ST JOHN (V.O.)
           Merciful Jesus, enlighten thou me
           with the brightness of thine
           inward light...

          Diana is helping Jane down the stairs.
                         
           ST JOHN (V.O.)
           And take away all darkness from
           the habitation of my heart...
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE PARLOUR
                         
          St John is praying over Jane, Diana and Mary as they sit at
          the table. Mary catches Jane's eye, gives her shy smile.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Join me to thyself with an
           inseparable band of love... For
           thou, even thou alone, dost
           satisfy him that loveth thee...
                         
          Jane finds herself staring at St John, who prays ardently.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           And without thee all things are
           vain and empty. Amen.
                         
          St John opens his eyes and looks searchingly at Jane. She
          immediately looks down.
                         
           JANE, MARY, DIANA
           Amen.

           Welcome to our table, Miss
           Elliott.
                         
                          JANE
           I'd appreciate it if you called
           me Jane. It is my own name.
                         
                          MARY
           It's wonderful to see you on your
           feet, Miss Jane.
                         
          Jane turns her attention to St John.
                         
                          JANE
           I trust I will not be eating long
           at your expense, Mr Rivers.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You wish to be independent of my
           charity?
                         
                          JANE
           I wish to work, sir. Show me how
           to work or how to seek work;
           that's all I ask.
                         
                          DIANA
           You're not fit enough to work.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           My sisters have always taken
           pleasure in keeping injured birds
           but I'm more inclined to put you
           in a way of keeping yourself -
           and shall endeavour to do so, if
           that's what you wish.
                         
                          JANE
           With all my heart, sir.
                         
                          DIANA
           It's a shame she has no choice of
           helpers, St John, and must put up
           with such crusty people as you.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           This school you were at, Miss
           Elliot, this charitable
           institution; what did it prepare
           you for?

          We see a bundle of sharp twigs come down on a girl's bare
          neck, like a whip.
                         
                          CUT TO:
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 20.
                         
                         
          Jane flinches at the memory.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Was it a thorough education?
                         
                          JANE
           Most thorough.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL.
                         
          Miss Scatcherd's bitter life is in her face and voice.
                         
                          MISS SCATCHERD
           Burns, Helen Burns!
                         
          Jane, aged ten, looks up. She is wearing a brown stuff
          frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls.
          Silence reigns in the school hall.
                         
          A red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns.
          Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been
          mistakenly cut.
                         
           MISS SCATCHERD (CONT'D)
           You're a slattern and a disgrace!
                         
          Helen Burns undoes the back of her dress. The punishment is
          given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs.
                         
          Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen
          Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As
          the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like
          one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected.
                         
          On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting
          party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple
          escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two
          smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's
          punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet.
                         
          Jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it.
          Brocklehurst's eyes sweep the room. They land on her.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           I might have known. The new girl.
           Step forward, Jane Eyre.
                         
          Filled with dread, Jane steps forward.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
           It is my duty dear children, to
           warn you that this girl is not
           one of God's own lambs.
                         
          We see the look of frustration on Miss Temple's face.

                          BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
           She is a castaway and an alien in
           his flock and you must be on your
           guard against her. For this
           child... is a liar!
                         
          He points to a tall stool. Jane stands on it.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST (CONT'D)
           This is the pedestal of infamy -
           and you'll remain upon it all
           day. You'll receive no sustenance
           and no comfort, for you must
           learn how barren is the life of
           the sinner. Children, I exhort
           you to shun her, exclude her,
           shut her out from this day forth.
           Withhold the hand of friendship
           and deny your love to Jane Eyre,
           the liar.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL - LATER.
                         
          The hall is empty but for the small figure of Jane, high on
          her stool, feeling her isolation like pain. Across the room
          is the slightly bigger figure of Helen, hunched, the back
          of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw. The sun
          is setting. At last Jane starts to sob.
                         
                          HELEN
           Come now, don't cry.
                         
                          JANE
           You're not allowed to speak to
           me. I must be shunned.
                         
                          HELEN
           Mr Brocklehurst is not a God.
           He's not liked or admired here -
                         
                          JANE
           He said I was a liar.
                         
                          HELEN
                          JANE -
                         
                          JANE
           I am not a liar!
                         
                          HELEN
           If your own conscience approves
           you, then so will I.
                         
          Jane is deeply gratified.
                         
                          JANE
           How do you bear it?

                          HELEN
           Bear what?
                         
                          JANE
           Being struck.
                         
                          HELEN
           I'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd.
           She hits me to improve me.
                         
                          JANE
           If she hit me I would get that
           birch from her hand and break it
           under her nose.
                         
                          HELEN
           You'd just be punished even more.
           It's part of life here.
                         
                          JANE
           I have always been excluded and
           alone and hated. Miss Abbott used
           to call me an ugly little toad.
                         
          Helen approaches Jane.
                         
                          HELEN
           You're not ugly. Do you know what
           is inside you?
                         
                          JANE
           What?
                         
                          HELEN
           The spark of your spirit, the
           principle of light and thought,
           pure and bright, as perfect as
           anything created.
                         
                          JANE
           What do you mean?
                         
                          HELEN
           Your soul. Your soul is beautiful,
           your soul has value - more value
           than anything on earth.
                         
                          JANE
           Is that true?
                         
                          HELEN
           Yes. God sees your beauty. Even
           as you stand on that stool, there
           is an invisible world around you,
           a kingdom of spirits. It is
           everywhere. Angels see your pain.
           Angels know your innocence.

                          JANE
           Angels?
                         
          Helen smiles a wide smile.
                         
                          HELEN
           Do you not believe in angels?
                         
          They hear the door. Helen runs back to her place; cowers.
          Miss Temple appears in a shaft of light at the door.
                         
                          MISS TEMPLE
           Come here, Girls.
                         
          The girls approach, dreading more punishment.
                         
           MISS TEMPLE (CONT'D)
           I shall investigate Mr
           Brocklehurst's claims against
           you, Jane. And unless they are
           proved, you will be exonerated.
                         
          Miss Temple looks over her shoulder.
                         
           MISS TEMPLE (CONT'D)
           Also, I understand you girls
           have had no food today.
                         
          She quickly presses a slice of hard cake into each girl's
          hand and walks away. Jane and Helen look at one another,
          deeply moved by her kindness.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - THE GARDEN / MOORS.
                         
          Jane stands between Diana and Mary high above Moor House.
          They are dressed similarly in bonnets and cloaks. They
          watch a hawk dive, their heads moving in unison. Their eyes
          land upon Moor House.
                         
                          MARY
           We've lived here all our lives but
           the house must be shut up now.
                         
                          JANE
           Why?
                         
                          MARY
           We can't afford to keep it on.
           Diana and I will return to our
           charges in a few days and St John
           will go to his parsonage.
                         
          Down below them, St John leaves Moor House and walks
          towards the village. Jane watches him.

           It'll be a hard parting for us. We
           may not see him again for years.
                         
                          JANE
           Why ever not?
                         
                          MARY
           He means to be a missionary. He's
           going to India to do Gods's work.
                         
                          JANE
           Can he not do God's work here?
                         
                          MARY
           This quiet parish will never do for
           him; he almost raves in his
           restlessness. It breaks our hearts.
                         
                          DIANA
           St John burns with talents and
           ambition. But he lacks the means
           for advancement here. Our poverty
           thwarts him at every turn and so he
           has chosen to lay all his gifts on
           God's altar.
                         
                          MARY
           We've tried to persuade him to
           stay but in some things our
           brother is - he is -
                         
                          DIANA
           Inexorable as death.
                         
                          MARY
           We are now without father. We'll
           soon be without home and brother.
                         
          Jane feels a powerful compassion for them.
                         
                          JANE
           In one thing you are fortunate.
                         
          She looks over at the horizon.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           You have each other.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE GROUNDS. SPRING.
                         
          Jane is looking at the high wall which is the horizon of
          her world at Lowood. Her eyes come to rest on the main
          door. Two men are carrying a small coffin out of the
          school. Brocklehurst follows it with a menthol-soaked cloth
          over his mouth and nose. He becomes aware of Jane's eyes on
          him. He looks away.

          INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - THE DORMITORY.
                         
          Jane is creeping down a corridor in her night dress. She
          peers in through the dormitory door. It has been turned
          into a sanitarium. Camphor and vinegar are being burnt.
          Jane can hardly look at the sick girls.
                         
          Miss Temple, pale with exhaustion, is speaking intimately
          to Madame Pierrot, the French mistress. Jane overhears.
                         
                          MISS TEMPLE
           This is the result of semi-
           starvation and neglected colds;
           Brockelhurst's idea of mortifying
           their bodies to save their souls.
                          TYPHUS -
                         
          Miss Temple can't say more.
                         
                          MADAME PIERROT
           Write to the governors. You must.
                         
          Jane creeps on.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM.
                         
          Jane opens the door. A small bed has been set up at the
          foot of Miss Temple's. In it lies Helen Burns. A candle is
          set on a table at her side. Jane takes her hand.
                         
                          JANE
           Helen.
                         
                          HELEN
           Is it you, Jane? Have you come to
           say goodbye?
                         
                          JANE
           You're cold.
                         
                          HELEN
           I'm very happy. I am going home.
                         
                          JANE
           Back to your father?
                         
                          HELEN
           My father has a new wife. He'll
           not miss me much.
                         
                          JANE
           Then where?
                         
                          HELEN
           To my future home, where all is
           light. I am going to God.

           No...
                         
          Jane is devastated. She climbs into bed next to Helen. For
          a moment, they hold each other. Jane's tears silently fall.
                         
                          HELEN
           Don't be sad. I will escape great
           suffering by dying young.
                         
                          JANE
           No...
                         
                          HELEN
           I don't have any talent to make
           my way in life. I should be
           always at fault. But God is my
           friend. He loves me.
                         
                          JANE
           Then he must save you.
                         
                          HELEN
           He is saving me.
                         
          Jane cannot articulate her distress at Helen's words.
                         
                          HELEN (CONT'D)
           I feel like I could sleep now. I
           like to have you near -
                         
                          JANE
           I won't leave you.
                         
                          HELEN
           You're so warm and alive. Jane,
           you have a passion for living.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. LOWOOD - MISS TEMPLE'S ROOM.
                         
          We see Miss Temple looking down at the bed in the dazzling,
          morning light. Jane, waking, has her small arms around
          Helen, as if fiercely protecting her. Helen is ashen, her
          eyes open, staring at some unseen thing. She is dead. Miss
          Temple lifts Jane away.
                         
                          MISS TEMPLE
           Jane...
                         
          Jane realises what has happened. We hear the sound of her
          distress begin. She is inconsolable.
                         
                          JANE
           No, no, no -

          Jane is staring out at the Autumn rain. She surreptitiously
          wipes her tears away and smiles up at Mary.
                         
                          JANE
           Have you something for me to do?
                         
                          MARY
           You are doing something already.
           May I see?
                         
          Jane hands her a book. She has drawn a bride.
                         
                          JANE
           That's Miss Temple on her wedding
           day. She was my teacher; a great
           influence on me. Under her
           guidance I became a teacher too.
                         
          Mary turns the page. It shows a sketch of St John Rivers.
          Mary gasps in delight. She takes the book straight to St
          John, who is diligently working at his desk.
                         
                          MARY
           St John -
                         
                          JANE
           No, Mary, please -
                         
                          MARY
           See how skilled Jane is.
                         
          St John looks at the sketch of himself. He is quite taken
          aback. He looks over at Jane, who is quite embarrassed.
                         
                          MARY (CONT'D)
           She is better than any drawing
           master we have ever had.
                         
          For a moment, St John seems to be weighing up whether to be
          insulted or not.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           How fierce I am, Miss Elliott.
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rivers, I wondered if you had
           yet heard of any work that I
           could do.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I found you a situation some days
           ago but I've delayed telling you
           because the work is lowly and I
           fear you'll scorn it.

                          ST JOHN
           As I am poor and obscure, the
           help I can offer is of the
           meanest sort.
                         
                          DIANA
           St John, what are you going to

                          ST JOHN
           When I took over the parish two
           years ago it had no school. I
           opened one for boys; I now intend
           to open one for girls. The school
           mistress will have a two-roomed
           cottage paid for by local
           benefactors and she will receive
           fifteen pounds a year. You can see
           how humble, how ignoble it is.
                         
          On the contrary, Jane is deeply gratified.
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rivers, I thank you heartily
           and I accept with all my heart.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           But you comprehend me? It's a
           village school - cottagers
           daughters. What will you do with
           all your fine accomplishments?
                         
                          JANE
           I will save them until they are
           wanted. They will keep.
                         
          Jane smiles at him. St John is impressed.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
                         
          Jane is at the blackboard in a freshly painted school room.
          In front of her are about twenty village girls, aged from
          six to sixteen. They are hanging on her every word.
                         
          Jane is writing a neat line of 'a's.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MORTON - JANE'S COTTAGE.
                         
          Jane's first home is like a doll's house. She walks through
          it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed,
          through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the
          scullery kitchen. She retraces her steps back into the
          parlour. She turns round and surveys it.

          Silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing
          of the wind. She feels glad, grateful, but very, very
          alone. She hears Brocklehurst's voice.
                         
                          BROCKLEHURST
           I hear you are to leave us, Miss
           Eyre.
                         
          She spins around as if he is there.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. A CHURCHYARD.
                         
          Brocklehurst is at the church door; Jane looking at him
          coldly. She holds a bunch of wild flowers.
                         
                          JANE
           Yes. Excuse me.
                         
          She walks into the graveyard. There are over forty small
          graves marked with wooden crosses, each bearing a child's
          name. One of them says Helen Burns. Jane lays down her
          flowers.
                         
          She looks up at Brocklehurst. He cannot meet her eye.
                         
          We hear the voice of Mrs Fairfax.

          Jane tries to quell her great unhappiness. She springs into
          action, straightening her furniture, stoking her fire.

           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           Jane Eyre is requested to send
           references and all particulars to
           Mrs Fairfax at Thornfield Hall.
                         
          Jane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts. It is
          no good. The memories crowd in.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE GROUND FLOOR.
                         
          A smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the
          darkness - Mrs Alice Fairfax.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           How do you do, my dear? What a
           long and tedious journey you must
           have had of it. John is quite the
           slowest driver in the county. You
           must be cold to the bone.
                         
                          JANE
           Are you Mrs Fairfax?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Indeed I am; come and warm
           yourself in here.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax leads Jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy
          parlour. Leah, a young maidservant, follows.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           Your poor hands must be quite
           numb; here, let me help you.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax undoes the ribbon on Jane's bonnet. Jane is
          taken aback, unused to motherliness of any kind.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           Leah, make a little hot port and
           cut a sandwich or two.
                         
          Leah eyes Jane with great curiosity. She hurries away.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Draw nearer the fire. John is
           taking your trunk up to your room.
                         
          Knitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair. Mrs
          Fairfax moves it and gestures for Jane to sit.

           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           I've put you at the back of the
           house; I hope you don't mind. The
           rooms at the front have much
           finer furniture but they are so
           gloomy and solitary I think.
                         
          Jane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in
          lace, embroidery, or fine crochet. The whole room is an
          advertisement for Mrs Fairfax's skill at handicrafts - and
          testament to the hours she has spent alone.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           I'm so glad you are come. To be
           sure this is a fine old house but
           I must confess that in winter one
           can feel a little dreary and
           alone. Leah is a very nice girl
           and John and Martha good people
           too, but they are servants - and
           one cannot talk to them on terms
           of equality.
                         
                          JANE
           Am I to have the pleasure of
           meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Who?
                         
                          JANE
           Miss Fairfax - my pupil?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Oh you mean Miss Varens; Mr
           Rochester's ward. She is to be
           your pupil.
                         
                          JANE
           Who is Mr Rochester?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Why, the owner of Thornfield.
                         
                          JANE
           I thought Thornfield Hall
           belonged to you.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           (bursting into laughter)
           Oh bless you child, what an idea.
           To me? I am only the housekeeper.

                          MRS FAIRFAX
           There is a distant connection
           between Mr Rochester and I - his
           mother was a Fairfax - but I'd
           never presume on it. Heavens, me,
           owner of Thornfield?
                         
          She continues to laugh. A bashful smile is playing on
          Jane's lips. Mrs Fairfax is beginning to thaw her.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL / STAIRCASE.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax is carrying a lamp across the great hall; the
          only light. Jane can perceive grandeur looming out of the
          darkness; Jacobean fireplace, coat of arms, head of a stag.
          Very gloomy, eerie. Her breath is vaporising in the cold.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           We shall have a cheerful house
           this winter...
                         
          As Jane follows Mrs Fairfax up the stairs, light is thrown
          on portraits of dour, craggy, long dead ancestors.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           With Miss Varens here - and with
           you - we'll have quite a merry
           time of it.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - A LONG GALLERY.
                         
          Dark heavy drapes, another striking portrait. A dark,
          voluptuous woman in an 18th Century gown, ruby lipped, one
          full breast exposed. Jane glances away, taken aback by the
          woman's bold expression and her nakedness.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           I'm sure that last winter - and
           what a severe one - if it didn't
           rain it snowed and if it didn't
           snow it blew a gale - last winter
           I declare that not a soul came to
           the house from November to
           February.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax leads Jane through the wood-panelled darkness.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           I got quite melancholy night
           after night alone. When spring
           finally came I thought it a great
           relief that I hadn't gone
           distracted.

           Here.
                         
          Jane looks in: a fire burning, a lamp lit by her bed, a
          soft quilt, pale chintz curtains.
                         
                          JANE
                          OH -
                         
          She is utterly speechless. Her eight years of physical
          discomfort and hardship are over.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Good night, my dear. I hope
           you'll be comfy.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax can see how affected she is - and how hard she
          is trying to button it down.
                         
                         
          INT. NEXT MORNING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane opens the curtains. She draws her breath in at the
          sight of the grounds. They are beautiful.

          Jane enters a magnificent room. Mrs Fairfax is dusting.
                         
                          JANE
           What a beautiful house.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Mr Rochester's visits here are
           always unexpected. He doesn't
           like to arrive and find
           everything all swathed up, so I
           keep it in constant readiness.
           Now, come and meet Miss Varens.
           Did I mention she was French?

          Adele Varens, an exquisitely dressed child of eight, is
          chatting animatedly to Jane and Mrs Fairfax. At her side is
          Sophie, her nurse - a desperately shy and lonely girl.

           Maman used to teach me to dance
           and say verses. When gentlemen
           came to see her I used to dance
           for them or sit on their knees
           and sing. May I sing for you now?
                         
                          JANE
                          (IN FRENCH)
           Well - that would be lovely.
           (To Mrs Fairfax)
           Adele is going to show us her
           accomplishments.
                         
          Adele adopts a lovelorn pose. She sings an operetta song; a
          forsaken lady plotting vengeance on her lover. Her high
          voice warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather
          weird. Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           How very French...
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.
                         
          Adele's song continues as a voiceover. Mrs Fairfax is
          finishing a shawl. Jane is showing Adele pictures of little
          objects that she has sketched. Adele names them in English.
                         
          The song ends. Jane gives Adele a sketch of herself.
                         
                          ADELE
           Me! It is me!
                         
          Mrs Fairfax shakes out the finished shawl and puts it round
          Jane's shoulders, departing before Jane can protest.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Here. For you.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 35.
                         
                         
          Jane is delighted at the kindness of the gift.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE LONG GALLERY
                         
          Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning
          sound of a gale outside. She holds her candle up to the
          portrait of the voluptuous woman.
                         
          She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.
          She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has
          achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing
          laugh in the darkness behind her. She is startled.
                         
                          JANE
           Who's there?
                         
          Her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves. She hears
          the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert
          with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.
                         
          To her relief Jane sees Mrs Fairfax approach with a lamp.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Who sleeps up here?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           No one. This part of the house is
           quite empty, except for you and me.
                         
                          JANE
           I heard someone.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           You can't have done.
                         
                          JANE
           A laugh. Someone laughed.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax flounders for a second.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Oh - that must be Grace Poole.
           She likes to sit up here with her
           sewing. Rather an eccentric soul.
           (She shouts sharply)
           Grace? Grace!
                         
          A door opens. Jane sees a broad-faced woman with slow,
          intelligent eyes. She looks as if she has just woken up.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           Miss Eyre has heard a laugh.
                         
          Grace looks at Jane with sly curiosity. She leaves the
          sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of
          steep steps are revealed. Grace climbs them and disappears.

          EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS.
                         
          Jane is on the turreted roof, looking up at the cawing
          rooks - and down at the view; a white, frosted wilderness.
                         
          Jane senses a presence behind her. She quickly turns. Mrs
          Fairfax is coming through the rooftop door.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           I thought I might find you up here.
           I've been waiting to pour our tea.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm not in need of tea, thank you.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax approaches, concerned.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           What is it, child? You've been
           here three months now and I'm
           worried that the position is not
           enough / to occupy your -
                         
                          JANE
           Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so
           thankful to be at Thornfield.
           Please don't think I'm so
           ungrateful as to be discontented.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           But it's a quiet life, isn't it?
           This isolated house; a still doom
           for a young woman...
                         
          Jane looks out at the view once more.
                         
                          JANE
           I wish a woman could have action
           in her life, like a man. It
           agitates me to pain that the sky-
           line over there is ever our
           limit. I long sometimes for a
           power of vision that would
           overpass it. If I could behold
           all I imagine... I've never seen
           a city, never spoken with men.
           I've never even seen a town of
           any size. And I fear my whole
           life will pass, without ever
           having...
                         
          Mrs Fairfax's troubled look makes Jane fall silent. Mrs
          Fairfax looks as if she is about to say something - then
          puts on her practical face, the moment of intimacy gone.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Well now - exercise is a great
           cure for anything, they say.

           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           I have some letters to post; will
           you take them?
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. A FROZEN MEADOW.
                         
          Jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters.
          The exercise is lifting her spirits. The sun is sinking,
          turning the frost gold.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. A FROZEN WOOD.
                         
          A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
          trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
          acutely aware of everything around her.
                         
          Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
          the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
          feet echoes. She steadies herself.
                         
          She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
          begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
          the whole winter is contained in it.
                         
          The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
          beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
                         
          Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
          The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
          of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
          she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
          startle both horse and rider.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What the deuce -
                         
          The rider gets the horse under control and continues, only
          to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
          with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
          with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
          trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

          Jane is confounded.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Pilot, get down! GET DOWN I SAY!
                         
                          JANE
           Can I do anything, sir?
                         
          Rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by
          darkening frost, the low moon behind her.

           Get back.
                         
          Jane doesn't move. Rochester turns to his horse.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Mesrour. Mesrour.
                         
          With much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to
          its feet. Rochester seems relieved.
                         
          He tries to stand himself. His ankle will bear no weight.
          He lets out an involuntary cry. It echoes:
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Damnation.
                         
                          JANE
           Are you injured, sir?
                         
          Rochester looks at her once more. He manages to get himself
          off the ice. He sits on a nearby stile. Jane approaches
          him. She now has the moon on her face. She begins to look
          less like a phantom and more like a girl.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           If you are hurt and want help I
           can fetch someone from the
           village. I'm on my way there to
           post a letter.
                         
          Rochester looks as if he doesn't believe her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER

           Do you know Mr Rochester?
                         
                          JANE
           No, I've never seen him.
                         
          Rochester is trying to place her. She is a puzzle to him.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You're not a servant there...

           (A slow smile)
           Deuce take me, I had forgotten.
                         
          Examining Jane once more, he laughs a low laugh.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

          Jane does not like to be laughed at.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Have you got an umbrella I can
           use as a stick?
                         
                          JANE
           No.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Then try to get hold of his
           bridle and lead him to me.
                         
          Jane doesn't like his imperious tone. She looks at the
          horse; huge, trampling, nervous. Rochester is amused.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           If you would be so kind...
                         
          Jane obeys. She endeavours to catch the bridle but the
          horse rears away. Jane falls on the ice. Rochester bursts
          out laughing. Jane picks herself up.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Perhaps it would be easier to
           bring me to the horse. Come here.
                         
          Jane resists.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Forgive me. I must beg of you to
           come here.
                         
          Jane approaches. Rochester instantly leans all his weight
          on her. She almost crumples under it; the first time she
          has ever touched and been touched by a man. She holds him
          up. And walks him closer to his horse.

          The horse approaches him. Rochester calms it. He springs
          into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

          Rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear.
          Jane steps back. The horse bounds away, the dog rushing in
          its traces. All three disappear.
                         
          Jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away.
          Her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark.
                         
                         
          I/E. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT ENTRANCE/HALL.
                         
          Jane runs up to the front door. She pushes it open. To her
          amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace.
          The whole hall is lit. The double doors are open into the
          library. Mrs Fairfax is hurriedly approaching.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Mr Rochester is here.
                         
                          JANE
           Oh?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Go and change your frock; he wishes
           to meet you.
                         
                          JANE
           I have to change?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Oh yes - I always dress for the
           evening when Mr Rochester is here.
                         
                          JANE
           But all my dresses are the same.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
                          (DESPERATELY)
           You must have one that is better?
           He's in a terrible humour; the
           doctor has been. His horse fell
           in Hay lane and his ankle is
           sprained.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library. A
          large dog wanders out. Jane finds herself looking at Pilot.
          She smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.
                         
          Jane enters. Rochester is in front of a superb fire - one
          foot bandaged and supported on a stool. Pilot is at his
          feet - and so is Adele, gazing adoringly at him.
                         
          Rochester is looking through Jane's portfolio of sketches
          and watercolours. Jane feels utterly exposed - as if her
          diary is being read. Mrs Fairfax timidly interrupts.

                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Here is Miss Eyre, Sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           (Without looking up)
           Let her sit.
                         
          Jane sits. Rochester continues to study her work.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I have examined Adele and I find
           you've taken great pains with
           her. She's not bright, she has no
           talents - yet in a short time
           she's made much improvement.
                         
          Adele is gazing at him uncomprehending, her face radiant.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You've been resident here three
           months?
                         
                          JANE
           Yes, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           And from whence do you hail;
           what's your tale of woe?
                         
                          JANE
           Pardon?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           All governesses have a tale of
           woe; what's yours?
                         
                          JANE
                          (SLIGHTLY INSULTED)
           I was brought up by my Aunt, Mrs
           Reed of Gateshead, in a house far
           finer than this. At ten years old
           I went to Lowood school where I
           received as good an education as
           I could hope for. I have no tale
           of woe, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Where are your parents?
                         
                          JANE
           Dead.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Do you remember them?

                          JANE
           No.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           And why are you not with Mrs Reed
           of Gateshead now?
                         
                          JANE
           She cast me off, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Why?
                         
                          JANE
           Because I was burdensome and she
           disliked me.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Lowood; that's a charity school,
           isn't it?
                         
                          JANE
           Yes.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           How long did you survive there?
                         
                          JANE
           Eight years.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           No tale of woe...
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           I daily thank providence for
           sending us Miss Eyre. She's a
           kind and patient teacher and an
           invaluable / companion -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Don't trouble yourself to give
           her a character. I'll judge for
           myself. She began by felling my
           horse.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I have her to thank for this
           sprain.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax looks at Jane, bewildered. Rochester lifts one
          of her watercolours.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Adele has brought me these; are
           they yours?
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 43.
                         
                         
                          JANE
           Yes sir.
                         
          A swollen sea. A cormorant, a golden bracelet held in its
          beak. A girl's arm coming out of the water, white and
          deathly, her drowned figure underneath.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Where did you get your copies?
                         
                          JANE
           Out of my head.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           That head I now see on your
           shoulders?
                         
                          JANE
           Yes sir.
                         
          He turns the next. The top of a hill. An expanse of
          twilight sky. Rising up, a girl's shape, her forehead
          crowned with a star, red hair flowing; Helen Burns.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Who's this?
                         
                          JANE
           The evening star.
                         
          Rochester gives her a direct gaze.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Why did you bewitch my horse?
                         
          Jane cannot reply.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE NURSERY.
                         
          Jane is by the blackboard, where she is writing sums.
                         
                          ADELE
           Tonight I will have my cadeaux.
           He always bring me a cadeaux.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax breathlessly enters.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Sorry to disturb. He's asked for
           your art.
                         
          Jane looks at her in disbelief.
                         
                          JANE
           What for?
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 44.
                         
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           He wishes to have it.
                         
                          JANE
           Why?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           To show to his company, I should
           think. Is this it here? Thank you.
                         
          Jane watches helplessly as Mrs Fairfax takes her portfolio.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/LANDING.
                         
          Jane is crossing the landing holding Adele's hand.
          Downstairs, the library doors swing wide open. The sound of
          male laughter can be heard; gentlemen walk out into the
          hall. Rochester follows, walking with a stick.
                         
                          ADELE
           Monsieur!
                         
          All eyes turn upon the landing. Jane tries to find a shadow
          to back into but there are none. Adele curtsies.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Ah, there she is...
                         
          It is unclear whether he is referring to Adele or Jane. He
          makes a bow. The men are staring at Jane with great
          curiosity. It makes her uncomfortable. She tugs Adele away.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE DRAWING ROOM.
                         
          A box tied with ribbons sits on the table.
                         
                          ADELE
           Ma boite, ma boite!
                         
          Rochester is leaning against the mantelpiece, drinking.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Take it away you genuine daughter
           of Paris and amuse yourself with
           disembowelling it.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           We'll open it together, shall we?
                         
          Mrs Fairfax kindly leads Adele away. Jane is about to cross
          the room with them.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Miss Eyre. Sit there.

          He gestures to a chair by the fire. Jane obeys. She studies
          Rochester. He is intent on Adele, who is pulling a pink
          satin dress out of the box.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I'm not fond of children.
                         
                          ADELE
           Oh Ciel! Que c'est beau!
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Nor do I particularly enjoy
           simple-minded old ladies. But you
           might suit me - if you would.
                         
                          JANE
           How, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           By distracting me from the mire
           of my thoughts.
                         
          Adele, irrepressible, runs across the room embracing the
          dress. She drops on one knee at Rochester's feet.
                         
                          ADELE
           Monsieur, je vous remercie mille
           fois de votre bonte...
                         
          She looks up, seeking his approval.
                         
                          ADELE (CONT'D)
           That is how Maman used to say, is
           it not?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Precisely.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Let's try it on, shall we?

           Your gaze is very direct, Miss

           I was too plain; I beg your pardon.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What fault do you find with me? I
           have all my limbs and all my
                          FEATURES -
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rochester, it was a blunder.
           I ought to have replied that
           beauty is of little consequence -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Now you stick a knife under my
                          EAR -
                         
                          JANE
           You have other qualities, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Just so; other qualities... When
           I was your age I was a felling
           enough fellow. I might have been
           insulted then. You're blushing
           Miss Eyre.
                         
                          JANE
           Not at all.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           And though you're not pretty any
           more than I am handsome, I must
           say it becomes you.
                          (HE LAUGHS)
           And now I see you're fascinated
           by the flowers on the rug.
                         
          Jane senses his mockery.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I'd like to draw you out. Come,
           speak to me.
                         
                          JANE
           What about, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           The choice of subject is entirely
           yours.
                         
                          JANE
           How can I introduce a subject
           when I don't know what'll
           interest you?

                          ROCHESTER
           The fact is, Miss Eyre, I don't
           wish to treat you like an
           inferior.
                         
                          JANE
           Yet you'd command me to speak?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Well I probably have a right to
           be a little abrupt and exacting
           on the grounds of my superiority
           in age. There must be twenty
           years between us and a century's
           advance in experience.
                         
                          JANE
           I don't think you have a right to
           command me just because you're
           older. Your claim to superiority
           depends on the use you've made of
           your time and experience.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I've made indifferent use of
           both. And this is why I sit,
           galled by my own thoughts - and
           order you to divert me. Are you
           very hurt by my tone of command?
                         
          Jane smiles.
                         
                          JANE
           There are few masters who'd
           trouble to enquire whether their
           paid subordinates were hurt by
           their commands.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Oh yes... paid subordinate; I'd
           forgotten the salary. Well on
           that mercenary ground, will you
           consent to speak with me as my
           equal - without thinking that the
           request arises from insolence?
                         
                          JANE
           I'd never mistake informality for
           insolence, sir. One, I rather
           like. The other, nothing free
           born should ever submit to - even
           for a salary.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Humbug. Most free-born things
           would submit to anything for a
           salary. But I mentally shake
           hands with you for your answer.

           Not three in three thousand
           schoolgirl governesses would have
           answered me as you've just done.
                         
                          JANE
           You've clearly not spent much
           time in the company of schoolgirl
           governesses. I'm the same plain
           kind of bird as all the rest,
           with my couple of accomplishments
           and my common tale of woe.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I envy you.

                          ROCHESTER
           Your openness, your clear
           conscience, your unpolluted mind.
           If I were eighteen I think we truly
           would be equals. Nature meant me to
           be a good man, one of the better
           kind and as you see, I am not so.
                         
                          JANE
           Are you a villain then, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'm a trite commonplace sinner,
           hackneyed in all the dissipations
           that the rich and worthless try
           to put on life.
                          (HE SIGHS)
           When I was your age, fate dealt me
           a blow. I was - cursed with a
           burden to carry through life. I
           lacked the wisdom to remain cool
           and I turned desperate. Dread
           remorse, Miss Eyre. It is the
           poison of life.

           And since happiness is denied me,
           I've a right to get pleasure in
           its stead. And I will get it,
           cost what it may.

           life.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           But, Miss Eyre, if the pleasure I
           was seeking was sweet and fresh;
           if it was an inspiration; if it
           wore the robes of an angel of
           light... what then?

           I don't know. To speak truth, I
           don't understand you at all.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           My heart has long been a charnel
           house. Perhaps it'll transform
           into a shrine.
                         
                          JANE
           Sir, I find the conversation has
           got out of my depth.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You're afraid of me because I
           talk like a sphynx.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm not afraid.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Yes you are.
                         
                          JANE
           I've simply no wish to talk
           nonsense.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           If you did it would be in such a
           grave, quiet manner that I would
           mistake it for sense. Do you
           never laugh, Miss Eyre?
                         
          This question cuts Jane to the quick.

           Only rarely, perhaps. But you're
           not naturally austere, any more
           than I'm naturally vicious. I can
           see in you the glance of a curious
           sort of bird through the close set
           bars of a cage: a vivid, restless,
           resolute captive. Were it but free,
           it would soar. Cloud high.

          Jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with Adele. Her
          playing is full of energy, very free. Her cheeks looks
          almost rosy. It is spring.

           Just as it turns to come down -
           that's when you hit it.
                         
          Adele serves. The game continues apace. Rochester wanders
          out of the open double doors of the library. He watches.
                         
          Something lands at his feet. A rook's feather. He looks up
          at the battlements. A shape disappears, too fast to see.
          Rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame
          and detestation. He stands in a terrible inner conflict.
                         
          Jane notices him - she misses her shot.

                          JANE
           Have mercy, Adele. Play with
           Pilot for a while.
                         
          Rochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Is our game disturbing you, sir?
                         
          He looks up. A hard and cynical expression has mastered his
          countenance, something resolute. Jane is taken aback.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           On the contrary. I like your game.
           I like this cold, hard day. I like
           Thornfield.
                         
          Rochester picks up the black feather. He starts to walk
          across the grounds at a fast pace. Jane follows.

           to Macbeth. 'You like Thornfield?'
           She said. 'Like it if you dare'.

           Get back! Keep at a distance
           child, or go in!
                         
          Adele's face crumples into tears. Rochester sees Jane's
          shock at his outburst. He walks away.
                         
          Jane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not.
          Adele has run back to Pilot. Jane watches her. She suddenly
          finds Rochester is back at her side. He walks her along.

           ugly as I am, I believed myself her
           idol. So I installed in her in a
           hotel, gave her servants, gowns
           cashmeres, diamonds - in short, I
           was an idiot.

           You've never felt love, have you
           Miss Eyre? Your soul still sleeps.
                         
                          JANE
           Does it?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You're still floating gently in
           the stream of life, unaware of
           the rocks ahead waiting to dash
           you to pieces.
                         
                          JANE
           Were you dashed to pieces, Mr
           Rochester?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Not by Celine. How can one ever
           truly love a woman one has paid
           for?

                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           It ended when I visited her
           unexpectedly one night and caught
           her with her handsome, charmless
           lover. I overheard her waxing
           lyrical on all my defects - she was
           mercenary, heartless, senseless.
           The whole intoxication fell away
           like a dream. I left her money to
           support the little French floweret
           over there, whom she swore blind
           was mine. I see no proof of my grim
           paternity in her features; I think
           Pilot is more like me than she.
                         
                          JANE
           But you took her on?
                         
          Adele is curled up, seeking comfort from the dog.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Some years later, I heard that
           Celine had abandoned the brat,
           disappeared to Italy and left it
           destitute. So I lifted it from the
           mud and slime of Paris and brought
           it here, to grow up clean in the
           wholesome soil of an English
           country garden. My one good work in
           a sea of countless sins.
                         
          Jane is looking at Adele full of compassion.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           You listen, Miss Eyre, as if it was
           the most usual thing in the world
           for a man like me to tell stories
           of his opera-mistresses to an
           inexperienced girl like you. Adele?
                         
          Adele looks up. Rochester speaks graciously.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Forgive me; for keeping Miss Eyre
           from your game for so long.
                         
          Adele is immensely gratified by his apology.
                         
                         
          INT. DUSK. THORNFIELD / THE RED ROOM.
                         
          Jane, aged ten, is walking along the long gallery. She
          opens a door and finds herself in the Red Room.
                         
          She stares into the mirror, searching the pale face of her
          reflection, as if trying to find an answer. A murmur seems
          to come down the gaping chimney; a woman's deep sigh.
          Jane's throat tightens with fear. Something moves in the
          shadows behind her.

          She scans them, her eyes full of terror. Jane knows beyond
          all doubt that something is there. She hears a low laugh.
          It seems to be right next to her. She tries to scream -
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - SECOND FLOOR.
                         
          Jane wakes. Her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in.
          She hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside
          her door - low and deep.
                         
                          JANE
           Who's there?
                         
          Footsteps run away. Jane springs out of bed and pulls the
          door open. A door shuts at the end of the corridor.
                         
          There is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush
          matting, flickering in the draft. Jane picks it up. She
          notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.
          She follows its trail through the pitch darkness. It is
          coming thickly from a half-open door at the front of the
          house - Rochester's.
                         
          Jane rushes in. Rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings,
          the curtains, all are alight. The flames are leaping.
          Rochester is asleep. She shakes him.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Wake up! Wake up! Sir!
                         
          Rochester only stirs. The smoke has stupefied him. Jane
          pulls the burning sheets off - then stops; he is naked. She
          takes his basin and douses the bed - soaking him.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Who's there?
                         
                          JANE
           It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.
                         
          Jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains. She
          pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the
          burning couch. When all the flames are out, she rushes to
          the windows and opens them. Smoke billows out. She stands
          in the moonlight, coughing.
                         
          Rochester is sitting up, staring at her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What in the name of all the elves in
           Christendom have you done with me?
                         
                          JANE
           For heaven's sake get up. Somebody
           has plotted something; you must
           find out who. I'll light the lamp -

                          ROCHESTER
           Light the lamp at your peril.
                         
          Rochester is springing out of bed. Jane turns away,
          mortified - having caught sight of his silhouetted shape.
                         
                          JANE
           I heard a laugh outside my door
           loud enough to wake me. I opened
           it. Someone was running towards
           the third floor.
                         
          Rochester is putting on a dressing gown, lighting the lamp.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           And a candle was left burning in
           the middle of the floor. Shall I
           fetch Mrs Fairfax, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What the deuce can she do?
                         
                          JANE
           Then I'll wake John and Martha.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Not at all. Stay here. You're
           shivering.
                         
          Rochester gets his coat and puts it round her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I have to go to the third floor.
           Don't make a sound. Sit there. I
           shan't be long.
                         
          He goes. Jane looks at his ruined chamber; The blackened
          drapes on the four poster bed, the fireplace, the huge
          wardrobe. It is not unlike the red room.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - ROCHESTER'S ROOM.
                         
          Half an hour later. First light. Jane is in an armchair.
          She has snuggled up in the coat. She takes in a breath,
          smelling its owner. She nuzzles her head against it. She
          closes her eyes, running her fingers down the lining.
                         
          She looks up. Rochester is watching her. His expression is
          peculiar. She holds the coat closely around her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Did you see anything when you

                          JANE
           Yes.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Have you heard that laugh before?
                         
                          JANE
           There's a woman who sews here;
           Grace Poole - She laughs in that
           way, I think.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Just so. Grace Poole - you have
           guessed it. Well, you're no
           talking fool; please say nothing
           about this.

                          ROCHESTER
           I will account for this state of
           affairs. Go back to your room and
           say nothing.
                         
                          JANE
           Yes, sir.
           (She takes off his coat)
           Good-night.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Is that how you're going to leave

                          JANE
           You said I should go.
                         
          Rochester approaches her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane, fire is a horrible death. You
           have saved my life. Don't walk past
           me as if we were strangers.
                         
                          JANE
           What am I to do then, sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           At least... shake hands.
                         
          Rochester holds out his hand. Jane takes it. They shake.

           There is no debt.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I knew you would do me good in some
           way. I saw it in your eyes when I
           first beheld you. Their expression
           did not - did not strike delight
           into my very inmost being so, for
           nothing. People talk of natural
           sympathies... You.
                         
          Rochester is drawing her slowly closer. Jane, disconcerted,
          is trying to resist.
                         
                          JANE
           Good night then, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           So you will leave me?

           I'm cold.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Go.
                         
          At last, he relaxes his grip. She backs away. She goes.
                         
                         
          INT. DAWN. THORNFIELD. JANE'S ROOM.
                         
          Jane is keeling on the windowsill, looking out at the
          rising sun. She is lit by its glowing rays; inspired. It's
          a rare feeling that prompts her mood, as new and unfolding
          as the day itself - happiness.

          Jane looks in to see Leah and Martha cleaning the soot from
          the woodwork and windowpanes. To her amazement, Grace Poole
          is there, calmly sewing rings to new curtains.
                         
                          GRACE
           Good day to you, miss.

           Fell asleep with his candle lit
           and the curtains got on fire.
           Managed to put it out with the

           Did you not hear anything, miss?

           I did. I heard a strange laugh.
                         
                          GRACE
           It's hardly likely the master
           would laugh when he was in such
           danger. Perhaps you were dreaming.

          Jane is infuriated. She turns on her heel.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.
                         
          Jane walks in. Their meal is laid out.
                         
                          JANE
           Has Mr Rochester not sent for us
           today?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Why, he's gone away. Were you not
           aware? He left after breakfast.
                         
          Jane takes this piece of news like an invisible shock.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           He's gone to The Leas, Mr
           Eshton's place, about ten miles
           from here. I believe Blanche
           Ingram is there. She's a great
           favourite of his.
                         
                          JANE
           Oh?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           I saw her two years ago when Mr
           Rochester had a party here. Oh,
           she was a beauty; I daresay the
           most elegant girl I've ever seen.
           So tall, with raven hair cascading
           down her back; I don't know how
           she'd had it done. She sang a duet
           with Mr Rochester. They made a
           lovely harmony.

           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           I was quite surprised he didn't
           make a proposal. Perhaps that is
           his intention now.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE NURSERY.
                         
          Jane is at the window, brooding. Outside the rain is
          pouring. Adele, dressed in yellow frills, is concerned.
                         
                          ADELE
           Qu'avez vous mademoiselle?
                         
                          JANE
           (without looking at her)
           Nothing. Speak in English,
           please.
                         
          Jane turns, expecting to see Adele.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
                         
          Jane finds herself in front of her class. They are looking
          at her expectantly. She looks back at them curiously. Eager
          faces, plain rural clothes. She has quite lost her place.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you, girls. You may go.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. MORTON - THE SCHOOL ROOM.
                         
          Jane is tidying up at the end of the day. The classroom is
          empty. Her life is bare. It shows on her face. She looks
          up. St John Rivers is watching her from the door.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Do you find the work too hard?
                         
          Jane immediately puts on a sprightly face and continues
          clearing up.
                         
                          JANE
           Not at all. I'm getting on very
           well.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Do you feel the solitude an
           oppression?
                         
                          JANE
           I hardly have time to notice it.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Then perhaps your accommodations
           have disappointed you. They are
           in truth scanty enough -
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 59.
                         
                         
                          JANE
           A few months ago I had nothing. I
           was wretched. Now I have a home
           and work; free and honest. I
           wonder at the goodness of God and
           at the generosity of my friends.
                         
          St John approaches her; speaks intimately.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           What you had left before I met
           you, I don't know. But I counsel
           you to resist firmly every
           temptation to look back.
                         
                          JANE
           It's what I mean to do.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           We can overcome every kind of human
           weakness. A year ago I was myself
           intensely miserable. I considered
           my life was so wretched that it
           must be changed - or I would die.
           After a season of darkness and
           struggling, light broke. I heard my
           call from God. Put your trust in
           him, Jane. Let him lead you to your
           future.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you.
                         
          St John is turning to go.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Why were you intensely miserable?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           A year ago, I was weak enough to
           fall in love.
                         
          Jane moves involuntarily towards him.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Don't pity me; I have no compassion
           whatsoever for you. I regarded this
           love as a fever of the flesh; not a
           thing that would ever touch my
           soul. I scorned the weakness,
           fought hard against it - and won.
                         
          Jane is incredulous. St John is at her desk. It is covered
          in her drawings. He glances through them.

           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           I could have listened to
           temptation, sunk down in the silken
           snare and known a feverish and
           delusive bliss. I could have
           squandered my future upon it.
                         
                          JANE
           You could have been happy.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           A slave in a fool's paradise? I'd
           rather my life had purpose -
                         
          St John suddenly snatches up a piece of paper.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Is this yours?
                         
                          JANE
           Yes.
                         
          His eyes, in an instant, seem to take in everything about
          her. He opens his mouth to speak - then checks himself.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           What's the matter?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Nothing in the world.
                         
          He folds the paper and takes it.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Good night.
                         
          He goes. Jane looks after him, puzzled.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax approaches Jane with a letter in her hand.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           He's back in three days he says -
           heavens that's Thursday - and not
           alone. He gives directions to
           prepare all the best rooms. I'm to
           get more staff from the George
           Inn. The ladies will bring their
           maids, the gentlemen, valets. We
           must accommodate them all.
           Supplies to be got; linen, the
                          MATTRESSES -
                         
          Mrs Fairfax has worked herself up into quite a panic.

           I'll get started. I'll go to the
           George. No, I'll tell Martha...
                         
          Jane can sense that the old lady is overwhelmed.
                         
                          JANE
           May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax?
                         
          We see Mrs Fairfax approach Jane in a rush of gratitude.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
                         
          Jane wears a housekeeper's apron over her dress. She enters
          Rochester's room with an armful of bed linen. It has been
          returned to its former glory. Adele is jumping up and down
          on the bed. Sophie is trying to coax her off it. Jane gives
          Sophie the sheets.
                         
          Adele leaves the room with Jane and skids all the way down
          the newly polished gallery in her stockinged feet. Jane
          can't help smiling.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHENS.
                         
          Jane sets down several bottles of wine on the kitchen table
          in order to dust them. The kitchen is a hive of activity -
          except for one lone figure sitting quietly in a chair by
          the fire, smoking a pipe; Grace Poole. Leah and one of the
          hired under cooks are talking abut her.
                         
                          UNDER COOK
           She gets good wages, I'd guess?
                         
                          LEAH
           Wish I had as good; not one fifth
           what Mrs Poole receives.
                         
          Jane affects not to listen, but is keenly interested.
                         
                          LEAH (CONT'D)
           And she's laying it all by. I
           shouldn't wonder if she's saved
           enough to keep her independent.
                         
                          UNDER COOK
           She's a good hand, I daresay.
                         
                          LEAH
           Not everyone could do it, that's
           for sure, not even for the money.
                         
                          UNDER COOK
           No wonder the master relies on
                          HER -

          Leah notices Jane's curious glance. She nudges the under
          cook. Jane, picks up the bottles and carries them away. As
          she passes she hears:
                         
           UNDER COOK (CONT'D)
           Doesn't she know?
                         
          At that moment, Adele rushes in.
                         
                          ADELE
           They're here! They're here!
                         
          Mrs Fairfax tries to get her apron off. She becomes
          flustered. Jane helps her.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Thank you.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax and Adele go. Jane looks out of the window.
                         
          Her attention is focussed on two equestrians who lead the
          arriving party; Rochester and Blanche, the dark beauty at
          his side. She is laughing at something. The sun shines
          behind her. Jane is dazzled. She turns away.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
                         
          Jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just
          as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. She stands
          back in a dark corner.
                         
          There is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. A
          flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. They
          descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist.
                         
          Jane steps out. She walks right into the path of Blanche
          Ingram, who is dressed in white. They both startle.
                         
                          JANE
           Excuse me, miss.
                         
          Blanche gives her a look of ice. Rochester is at the top of
          the stairs.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Good evening.
                         
          They both turn. Rochester has seen Blanche, not Jane. He
          offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. Jane sinks
          back into the shadows.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           May I?
                         
          Blanche lays her gloved hand on Rochester's arm, barely
          touching him. They glide away.

          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE HALL.
                         
          Adele and Jane sit on the stairs, listening to Blanche and
          Rochester sing. Their voices thrill. Jane is trying not to
          feel. But when Rochester hits an exceptionally beautiful
          note, she involuntarily closes her eyes.
                         
          Adele leans into Jane. She is crying.
                         
                          JANE
           What is it, darling?
                         
                          ADELE
           She sing like Maman.
                         
          Jane, full of compassion, takes Adele back to her room.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SCHOOLROOM.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax enters in a great hurry.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Tonight. He wants you both in the
           drawing room after dinner.
                         
          Adele leaps up, delighted. Jane is crestfallen.
                         
                          JANE
           Not me, surely.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           It's his particular wish.
                         
                          JANE
           He was being polite.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           I'm instructed to tell you that
           if you resist, he'll come up and
           get you himself. You needn't stay
           long. Just let him see you and
           then slip away. Don't worry; no
           one'll look at you.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE DRAWING ROOM/HALL
                         
          Jane is delivering Adele into the centre of the company.
                         
                          JANE
           May I present Miss Adele Varens?
                         
                          ADELE
           Bon jour, mesdames, monsieurs.
                         
          Jane finds it hard to get a proper impression of the
          guests, as she cannot raise her eyes to look at them.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 64.
                         
                         
          Adele makes a dainty curtsey - pink frock, hair in
          ringlets, little lace gloves. In the midst of the crowd is
          Blanche.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Why, what a little puppet.
                         
                          LADY INGRAM
           (mutton dressed as lamb)
           Is this your ward, Mr Rochester?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Yes.
                         
                          LOUISA ESHTON
           (English rose; nineteen)
           What a love of a child.
                         
          Adele blissfully disappears into a moving sea of dresses.
          Only one guest is still looking in Jane's direction;
          Blanche. Her lip curls in distaste.
                         
          Jane backs into a nearby window seat; always her place of
          refuge. She closes her eyes. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
                         
          When she opens her eyes, Rochester is in her line of
          vision, standing out in a crowd of unmanly men. He senses
          her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work
          on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes
          from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -
          and of her love. Blanche sidles up to Rochester.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           I thought you weren't fond of
           children?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You're right; I'm not.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Then what induced you to take
           charge of that little doll?
                         
          Rochester turns away from Jane.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           She was left on my hands.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Why don't you send her to school?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           She has a governess.
                         
          Jane glances up; sees Rochester's back to her, throws her
          eyes down, once more.

                          BLANCHE
           You should hear mamma on the
           chapter of governesses. I had
           half a dozen in my day - all
           detestable, ridiculous incubi -
           were they not, mamma?
                         
                          LADY INGRAM
           Did you speak, my lily flower?
                         
                          BLANCHE
           I said governesses.
                         
          The reaction is instant.
                         
                          LADY INGRAM
           Oh, don't mention them; the very
           word makes me nervous! I've
           suffered a martyrdom from their
           incompetence and caprice. I thank
           heaven we're now done with them.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           I have just one word to say of
           the whole tribe; nuisance.
                         
          Jane's fingers sew. Only the briefest flash of her eyes
          towards the company shows her mortification. Blanche has
          started playing a brilliant prelude on the piano.
                         
                          BLANCHE (CONT'D)
           We shall have music - and new
           subject, if you please. Signor
           Eduardo, what shall it be?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Donna Bianca, I give you beauty.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Beauty? Why there's nothing new
           to be said. I give you back male
           beauty. Mamma, what's your idea
           of male beauty?
                         
                          LADY INGRAM
           My son, of course.
                         
                          LORD INGRAM
           Hear hear.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Oh, Tedo's quite typical of the
           young men of today. They're so
           absorbed in the pursuit of
           fashion that they've forgotten
           how to be men at all.

                          LORD INGRAM
           I say -
                         
                          BLANCHE
           A woman who neglects herself is a
           blot on humanity. But a man
           should pay no heed to his looks.
           (Glancing at Rochester)
           A man should possess only
           strength and valour. He could be
           a gentleman or a highwayman. His
           beauty lies in his power.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           So a Levantine pirate would do
           for you?
                         
                          BLANCHE
                          (QUIETLY)
           As long as he resembled you.
                         
          Rochester laughs loudly. Jane is heading for the door.
                         
                          BLANCHE (CONT'D)
           I am serious. To my mind, a man
           is nothing without a spice of the
           devil in him.
                         
          Jane closes the door on Blanche. She breathes in fresh air,
          nauseous. Blanche's splendid prelude drifts out.
                         
          Rochester comes into the hall from the other door. Jane
          instantly bends down and pretends to be tying her shoe.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Why did you leave the room?
                         
                          JANE
           I am tired, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Why didn't you come and speak to
           me? I haven't seen you for weeks.
           It would have been normal and
           polite to wish me good evening.
                         
                          JANE
           You seemed engaged, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What have you been doing while
           I've been gone?
                         
                          JANE
           Teaching Adele.

                          ROCHESTER
           You're depressed; your eyes are
           shining with tears. What's the
           meaning of this?
                         
          Jane catches sight of Mrs Fairfax, who is watching them
          with an expression of unease. Rochester glares at her.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           A gentleman has arrived to see
           you, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Who?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           He says he's travelled a long
           way, from Spanish Town, Jamaica -
                         
          Rochester seems winded.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           And indeed I think he must have
           come from some hot country because
           he won't take off his coat.
                         
                          ROCHESTER

                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Mr Richard Mason. He says you're
           old friends. I've put him in the
           morning room.
                         
          Rochester cannot speak.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (CONT'D)
           Have I done wrong?

           Not at all. Please tell him I'll
           see him directly.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax goes.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Oh Jane - Jane. This is a blow.

           Can I help you sir?
                         
          In the drawing room, Blanche's prelude finishes to
          enthusiastic applause. Rochester has Jane's hand.

          Rochester lets her hand go. He steps back. He goes to the
          morning room. Jane peers through the door, worrying how her
          last words have given offence.
                         
          She sees a man rising to meet Rochester; handsome but gaunt
          and painfully thin. His smile doesn't reach his eyes - as
          if his soul is not quite his own.

          INT. DAY. LOWOOD - THE HALL.
                         
          Jane is standing on the pedestal of infamy, ten years old.
          Helen Burns is walking towards her with something in her
          arms. The rising sun is all around her.
                         
                          HELEN
           He is yours.
                         
          Jane looks down at the bundle. In it, is a newborn boy.
          Jane looks up to ask Helen for help. But Helen has gone.
                         
          Jane alone with her burden, teeters on the stool. The baby
          starts to cry. Jane panics.
                         
          The crying becomes deafening, terrifying. It is not a
          baby's cry but a human scream.

          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM/ THE GALLERY.
                         
          Jane wakes, hearing a savage, sharp shriek of such power
          and intensity it seems to tear the night in two.
                         
          Overhead, the sounds of a struggle begin - a deadly one.
          Jane hears footsteps rush past her door. She starts to pull
          on her dress. She hears a man's voice from above:
                         
           MASON (O.S.)
           Help! Rochester, for God's sake
           come!
                         
          A great stamp on the floor above; something falls with a
          thud; silence. Jane grabs her candle and leaves her room.
                         
          The guests likewise are all issuing from their rooms; some
          with candles, some stumbling into the dark. The gallery is
          filling with terrified ladies and shocked gentlemen. Their
          shadows dance grotesquely on the walls.
                         
                          LADY INGRAM
           Oh what is it?
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Who is hurt?
                         
                          LORD INGRAM
           Where the devil is Rochester?
                         
          Rochester comes forth from the door at the end of the
          gallery, holding a candelabra.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'm here, be composed.
                         
          Blanche flies towards him like a banshee.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           What awful event has taken place?
                         
          She embraces him. Rochester patiently removes her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           A servant has had a nightmare,
           that's all. She's an excitable,
           nervous person and has taken a
           fit with fright.
                         
          Jane, the only person behind Rochester, sees by the light
          of her candle that his dressing gown is trailing blood.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Now I must see you back into your
           rooms because until the house is
           settled, she can't be properly
           looked after.

                          BLANCHE
           Is there anything I might do?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Miss Ingram, ladies, please
           return to your nests like the
           doves that you are. You'll take
           cold for certain if you stay in
           this icy gallery any longer.
                         
          The candles flicker and fade as the guests make their way
          back to their rooms. Rochester sees Jane.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR.
                         
          Rochester stops by a low door. He puts a key in the lock.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Be steady. I need you.
                         
          He unlocks it. A room hung with tapestries; a four poster
          bed with its curtains half drawn. One part of the tapestry
          is hooked up over a hidden door - which lies open to an
          inner chamber. A dull, sickly light shines out.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Wait.
                         
          He goes to the inner chamber. A grim laugh greets him.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Thank you, Mrs Poole.
                         
          He locks the door. Jane shudders. He goes to the bed.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Here. Bring the candle.
                         
          Jane obeys. Richard Mason is lying, one arm and all the
          linen soaked in blood. Jane controls her reaction and makes
          herself useful. Rochester is cleaning the wound.

           She sucked the blood. Said she'd

                          ROCHESTER
           Think of her as dead, dead and
           buried. Say nothing!
                         
          Mason is silenced. Rochester puts the bloody sponge into
          Jane's hand.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I am going for a doctor. I must
           leave you here with him. Sponge
           the blood away when it returns.
           Give him water if he wants it. Do
           not speak to him for any reason.
           And Richard - on pain of death -
           do not speak to her.
                         
          Rochester takes the candelabra. He is gone. Mason is
          staring at Jane. There is something about the pupils in his
          eyes that she finds deadly, chilling.
                         
          She dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the
          trickling gore.
                         
          She hears a low moan. She looks over at the door to the
          inner chamber, aching to know the mystery behind it. Mason
          makes her start by taking her wrist. He is trying to say
          something. Jane puts her finger to her lips. She is begging
          him not to speak.

          Rochester and Dr Carter are carrying Mason down the stairs.
                         
                          DR CARTER
           I only wish I could have got here

          A carriage waits. Rochester lifts Mason in to Dr Carter.
          Jane hands in Mason's great coat. She stands back.
                         
                          ROCHESTER

          The carriage goes. Jane prepares to go inside but Rochester
          walks her towards the orchard.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)

          The orchard is a different world; the dawn light
          illuminating dewy trees. Rochester is silent. Jane is
          trying to fathom him.

          Rochester, gazing at her, seems to have decided something.
          He turns a corner and is gone. Jane is left alone. We hear
          the sound of a blow.

           At your peril you advertise. Trust

           And sir? Forgive me but I have had
           no wages as yet.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           How much do I owe you?
                         
                          JANE
           Fifteen pounds.
                         
          Rochester looks in his wallet.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Here's fifty.
                         
                          JANE
           That's too much.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Take your wages.
                         
                          JANE
           I cannot.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Then I only have a ten.
                         
                          JANE
                          (TAKING IT)
           Now you owe me five.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Just so. Come back for it quickly.
           Meantime, I shall safeguard it in
           here.
                         
          He taps the wallet, which is in his breast pocket.

           Not a whit, sir. You are not to
           be trusted at all.

          Bessie, now housekeeper, is moving forward to meet Jane.
                         
                          BESSIE
           Bless you! - I knew you'd come.
                         
          They embrace.
                         
                          JANE
           Bessie... I'm not too late? How
           is Mrs Reed?
                         
                          BESSIE
           She may linger yet a while. She's
           spoken of you daily. At first we
           couldn't tell what she was saying
           but when her speech came clear we
           heard 'Jane Eyre, get Jane Eyre.'
                         
                          JANE
           Shall I see her now?
                         
                          BESSIE
           I'll take you up directly. But look
           at you. What a lady you've become.
           Why you're almost pretty.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - MRS REED'S BEDROOM
                         
          Jane takes her aunt's hand. Mrs Reed looks very near death.
                         
                          JANE
           Aunt Reed? It is Jane Eyre. You
           sent for me, and here I am.
                         
          Mrs Reed, with an effort, pulls her hand away from Jane's.
                         
                          MRS REED
           No one knows the trouble I have
           with that child. Such a burden.
           Left on my hands. Speaking to me
           like a fiend. The fever at
           Lowood. She should have died!
                         
                          JANE
           Why do you hate her so?
                         
                          MRS REED
           Her mother. Reed's sister - his
           beloved. When news came of her
           death he wept like a fool. Sent
           for the baby. Sickly thing - not
           strong like mine. But Reed loved
           it. Kept it by his bed. Made me
           vow to bring the creature up. Why
           did he not love mine?

          The words are a revelation to Jane. Mrs Reed gazes at her.
                         
           MRS REED (CONT'D)
           Who are you?
                         
                          JANE
           I am Jane Eyre, Aunt.
                         
                          MRS REED
           You. Is there no one in the room?
                         
          Jane motions Bessie to go.
                         
                          JANE
           We are alone.
                         
                          MRS REED
           I've twice done you wrong. I
           broke the vow I made to Reed -
                         
                          JANE
           Please, don't think of it -
                         
                          MRS REED
           I am dying; I must get it out!
                         
          Mrs Reed indicates a box on her bedside table.
                         
           MRS REED (CONT'D)
           Open that box. Take out the
           letter. Read it.
                         
          Jane obeys. She reads the letter aloud.
                         
                          JANE
           'Madam, will you have the goodness
           to send me the address of my
           niece, Jane Eyre. I desire her to
           come to me at Madeira. Fortune has
           blessed my endeavours and as I am
           childless I wish to adopt her and
           bequeath her at my death whatever
           I may have to leave. Yours, John
           Eyre, Madeira.'
                         
          Jane is stunned.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           This is dated three years ago.
           Why did I never hear of it?
                         
                          MRS REED
           Because I wrote and told him you
           had died of typhus at Lowood
           school. You fury. You were born to
           be my torment. I'll never forget
           how you turned on me and raged.

           MRS REED (CONT'D)
           You called the names of the dead
           down upon me. I was afraid.
                         
                          JANE
           Forgive me.
                         
                          MRS REED
           You cursed me.
                         
                          JANE
           I would have loved you if you'd
           let me.
                         
                          MRS REED
           My life has been cursed.
                         
                          JANE
           Please, let us be reconciled.
                         
          Mrs Reed shrinks from Jane's touch. Jane wipes her tears.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Then love me or hate me as you
           will. You have my full and free
           forgiveness. Now ask for God's -
           and be at peace.
                         
          Mrs Reed's eyes close.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. GATESHEAD - THE RED ROOM.
                         
          The morning sun is pouring in. Jane goes to the bed. She
          puts her hand upon it, gently, as if thanking her uncle for
          all he did. She notices a picture on the wall. A miniature
          of a brown-haired woman with elfin eyes.
                         
          Jane takes it off the wall. Bessie comes in.
                         
                          JANE
           My mother.
                         
          Bessie nods. A tear rolls down Jane's face. She clasps the
          picture, looking round the room.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Why ever was I so afraid?

          A coach pulls up in the lane near Thornfield. Jane gets
          out. We hear her voice.
                         
           JANE (V.O.)
           My dear uncle, some years ago, my

           that I had died.

          EXT. EVENING. A SUMMER WOOD.
                         
          Jane is walking through the wooded glade where she first
          met Rochester. All is green and verdant and bathed in
          sunset light. There seems to be life everywhere.
                         
           JANE (V.O.)
           I am writing to tell you that I
           am very much alive and living at
           Thornfield Hall, where I am
           currently governess to the ward
           of Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester -
                         
           ROCHESTER (O.S.)
           There you are.
                         
          Jane turns. Rochester is sitting on the stile where they
          first met. For a moment, her every nerve is unstrung.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Just like one of your tricks to
           steal into your home along with
           the twilight. Where the deuce
           have you been this last month?
                         
                          JANE
           I have been with my aunt sir, who
           is dead.
                         
          Rochester laughs.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           A true Janian reply. If I dared
           I'd touch you, to see if you were
           real...
                         
          Jane puts out her hand. Rochester takes it. He helps Jane
          over the stile.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Go home - stay your wandering
           feet at a friend's threshold.
                         
          Jane lets go of his hand.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm
           strangely glad to get back again to
           you. Wherever you are is my home.
                         
          Jane, knowing she has said too much, turns and runs over
          the fields towards Thornfield.

                          MRS FAIRFAX
           We're expecting the announcement
           very soon. He went down to London
           only last week to buy her a new
           carriage.
                         
                          JANE
           Then we must accept it. He'll
           soon bring home his bride.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWILIGHT. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD
                         
          Jane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening -
          looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again.
          She turns a corner and sees Rochester staring intently at
          something. His back is to her. She is about to tiptoe away.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Come and look at this fellow, Jane.
                         
          Jane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence.
          Rochester is looking at a huge moth.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Look at his wings. He looks West
           Indian - I have never seen one
           like him, here. There; flown.
                         
          They watch the moth as it flies towards the house.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Thornfield is a pleasant place in
           summer, isn't it?
                         
                          JANE
           I'll be sad to leave it.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Yes, but it can't be helped. I
           soon hope to be a bridegroom.
                         
                          JANE
           Have you found me a new situation,
           sir?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           A situation, yes of course. It's
           the least I can do for a faithful
           paid subordinate such as yourself.
           You're to undertake the education
           of the five daughters of Mrs
           Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge,
           Connaught.

                          ROCHESTER
           You'll like Ireland. They're such
           warm-hearted people, they say.
                         
                          JANE
           It is a long way away, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           From what?
                         
                          JANE
           From here. From you.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           We've been good friends, Jane
           haven't we? But with the Irish sea
           between us you'd soon forget me.
                         
          Jane's great distress escapes her.
                         
                          JANE
           I wish I could. I wish I'd never
           come here. I love Thornfield -
           I've lived a full life here. I've
           not been trampled on or petrified
           or buried with inferior minds.
           I've talked face to face with what
           I reverence, with what I delight
           in. I've known you Mr Rochester -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Then why must you be torn from me?
                         
                          JANE
           Because of your bride.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I have no bride.
                         
                          JANE
           But you will have.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Yes, I will.
                         
                          JANE
           Then I must go.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You must stay.
                         
                          JANE
           Do you think I could stay to become
           nothing to you? Am I an automaton,
           a machine without feelings?

                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Do you think that because I am
           poor, obscure, plain and little
           that I am soulless and heartless?

                          JANE -
                         
                          JANE
           I have as much soul as you and full
           as much heart. I'm not speaking to
           you through mortal flesh. It's my
           spirit that addresses your spirit
           as if we'd passed through the grave
           and stood at God's feet, equal - as
           we are.
                         
          Rochester takes Jane in his arms.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           As we are.
                         
          Jane struggles away from him.
                         
                          JANE
           Let me go.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
                          NO -
                         
                          JANE
           I'm a free human being with an
           independent will, which I now
           exert to leave you.
                         
          Rochester releases her. She stands in front of him.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Then let your will decide your
           destiny. I offer you my hand, my
           heart and a share of all this.
                         
          He gestures towards the house, the land. Jane is stunned.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I ask you to pass through life at
           my side. Jane, you are my equal
           and my likeness. It is you I
           intend to marry.
                         
                          JANE
           Are you mocking me?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Do you doubt me?

           Your bride is Miss Ingram -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What love have I for Miss Ingram?
           What love has she for me? I
           caused a rumour to reach her that
           my fortune was lost and got
           instant coldness. I wanted to
           make you jealous, to move you to
           love me. It's you - you strange,
           unearthly thing. I love you as my
           own flesh. You - poor and obscure
           as you are - please accept me as
           your husband.
                         
          Jane begins to believe him.

           I must have you for my own.

           I swear it.
                         
                          JANE
           You love me.
                         
                          ROCHESTER

          They embrace.
                         
          Neither Jane nor Rochester moves. Darkness is almost

          It is teeming with rain. Rochester and Jane run to the
          front entrance. He holds his jacket around her. Lightning.
          They reach the dry hearth inside. Thunder. They are both
          euphoric, breathless, laughing.

           Have you accepted him?

           Yes.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Well I never would have thought.

           No, I've long noticed that you were
           a sort of pet of his. But you're so
           young and so little acquainted with
           men. I don't want to grieve you
           child, but let me put you on your
           guard. Gentlemen in his position...
           Let's just say they're not
           accustomed to marry their
           governesses. Until you are wed,
           distrust yourself as well as him.
           Please, keep him at a distance -
                         
          Jane has heard enough. She turns away.

          INT. DAY. A HABERDASHER'S SHOP.
                         
          Rochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks. Jane
          gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           This morning I wrote to my banker
           in London to send certain jewels.
           In a day or two I hope to pour
           them into you lap -

           Oh, no sir -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I will put the diamond chain
           around your neck myself -
                         
                          JANE
           I don't want jewels -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'll dress you in these satins -

           Then you won't know me. I'll not
           be Jane Eyre any longer but an
           ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put
           them away.

           Well for cool native impudence

           haven't your equal.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm naturally proud. And hard and
           flinty. You ought to know what
           sort of bargain you've made while
           you've still got time to rescind
           it. I want only one thing from
           you, Mr Rochester.
                         
                          ROCHESTER

           Your regard.
                         
          Jane puts her arm through Rochester's. He smiles.

           It's your time now, little tyrant
           but it'll soon be mine and when I
           have seized you, to have and to
           hold, I'll attach you to a chain,
           like this...
                         
          Rochester flicks his watch into the air.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - MRS FAIRFAX'S PARLOUR.
                         
          A summer gale. The moan of the wind sounds almost human.
          The light is sickly, nightmarish.
                         
          A great box sits on the table, which Jane is opening.
          Adele, Sophie and Mrs Fairfax are all looking on. Jane
          pulls out a pearl coloured wedding gown. She is dismayed at
          its opulence.
                         
          She holds it up to herself. Adele starts to play with the
          great veil. She wraps it round herself. She becomes caught
          in it, tangled, distressed.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
                          JANE
           Adele?
                         
          Jane wakes. There is a candle alight at the end of her bed.
          Her eyes focus. Her wardrobe is open. Jane is unnerved.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Adele, is that you?

          A form emerges, a woman, tall and gaunt, with thick, black
          hair hanging down her back. She is dressed in a nightgown -
          like a shroud. Over her head, she wears Jane's bridal veil;
          a phantom bride.
                         
          Jane is paralysed with terror.
                         
          The form takes the veil and slowly tears it in half;
          bruised arms, dirt, predatory nails, neglect. The last
          thing to be revealed is the woman's face, pale and ghastly.
          Her eyes are glittering with hatred.
                         
          The figure takes the candle and bends down to Jane. Her
          intention looks deadly. Jane's breath catches. She cannot
          breathe.
                         
          The figure moves closer, then blows out the candle.
          Darkness.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane wakes, lying half out of the bed. The veil is over
          her. She flings it away from her face. Jane sits, her
          terror dawning. Her breath comes in great dry sobs. She is
          shocked to find herself still alive.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. - THORNFIELD - BY THE GATES
                         
          Jane is waiting, pale with anxiety. A man on horseback
          approaches, a great dog at his side; Rochester. He is
          grinning.
                         
          He pulls Jane up on the horse in front of him. She curls
          into his arms, desperate for his comfort and his strength.
          Rochester senses something is wrong. He slows the horse.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What is it?
                         
                          JANE
           I'm afraid.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Rochester holds the torn veil in his hands. He is aghast.
          He cannot think what to say.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane, this is the only explanation.
           It must have been half-dream, half-
           reality. A woman did enter your
           room last night and that woman was -
           must have been - Grace Poole -
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 88.
                         
                         
                          JANE
           It was not Grace Poole.
                         
          Rochester keeps talking over her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You know how strange she is. What
           did she do to me? To Mason? In a
           state between sleeping and waking -
                         
                          JANE
           I was not asleep.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You noticed her entrance and her
           actions but you've ascribed to
           her an appearance different from
           her own. That was your nightmare -
                         
                          JANE
           I know what I saw.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I see you'd ask why I keep such a
           woman in my house. When we've been
           married a year and a day, I promise
           I'll tell you. Are you satisfied
           Jane? Do you accept my solution?
                         
          Jane clearly doesn't. Rochester takes her in his arms.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Dear God. It was only the veil...
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - ADELE'S ROOM.
                         
          Jane is in an unadorned pearl wedding gown.
                         
                          ADELE
           Mademoiselle...
                         
          Adele gives her a small bouquet. Jane hugs her, very moved -
          as if she is leaving her childhood behind. She turns to go.
                         
                          SOPHIE
           Please, you must look.
                         
          Jane gazes stupefied at the stranger in the mirror.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE HALL.
                         
          Rochester is waiting at the bottom of the stairs for Jane.
          She slows when she sees him. She finds she cannot speak.
          Neither can he.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax is by the door. Jane can't find words for her.

           Come.
                         
          Rochester grips her hand. They quit the house.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          Rochester, grimly resolute, is striding at a pace Jane can
          hardly follow. Her satin shoes are muddy. She is becoming
          breathless. A rook flies over their heads, cawing.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE CHURCH.
                         
          Rochester is striding purposefully towards a small church
          of ancient design. Jane stumbles. Rochester is contrite.
                         
          Jane tries to collect herself. She looks up to the sky. The
          rook wheels around the spire. She takes Rochester's hand.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THE CHURCH
                         
          At the altar, Jane glances at Rochester. He is looking
          straight ahead at the clergyman, Wood.
                         
                          WOOD
           I require and charge you both, as
           ye will answer at the dreadful
           day of judgement when the secrets
           of all hearts shall be revealed,
           that if either of you know any
           impediment why ye may not be
           lawfully joined together in
           matrimony, ye do now confess it.
                         
          There is not a sound. Rochester still doesn't look at Jane.
          The clergyman prepares the rings.
                         
                          WOOD (CONT'D)
           Edward Fairfax Rochester, do you
                          TAKE -
                         
          A commotion at the back of the church. Two men rapidly
          enter. One of them Briggs, hurries up the aisle.
                         
                          BRIGGS
           The marriage cannot go on. I
           declare the existence of an
           impediment.
                         
          Rochester moves, shaken.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Proceed.

                          BRIGGS
           The ceremony is quite broken off.
           An insuperable impediment to this
           marriage exists.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Proceed.
                         
                          BRIGGS
           Mr Rochester has a wife now
           living.
                         
          Wood is utterly dismayed.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
                          (SHOUTS)
           Where is your proof?
                         
          Briggs starts to read out a document.
                         
           BRIGGS (O.S.)
           I affirm and can prove that Edward
           Fairfax Rochester was fifteen years
           ago married to my sister, Bertha
           Antoinetta Mason at St James
           church, Spanish Town, Jamaica.
                         
          Jane looks at Rochester. She forces him to look at her. He
          denies nothing; defies everything.
                         
                          BRIGGS (CONT'D)
           The record of the marriage will be
           found in the register of that
           church - a copy of it is now in my
           possession. Signed, Richard Mason.
                         
          Rochester turns to Briggs.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           That does not prove that my wife
           is still living.
                         
                          BRIGGS
           She was living two months ago.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           How do you know?
                         
                          BRIGGS
           I have a witness to the fact.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Produce him or go to hell.
                         
          The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is
          Richard Mason. Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of
          rage escapes him. He lifts his arm.

                          MASON
           Good God -
                         
                          WOOD
           Sir, you are in a sacred place -
                         
          Mason flinches away. Rochester swallows his rage.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           What have you to say?
                         
                          MASON
           She is at Thornfield Hall. I saw
           her there in April. I'm her
           brother.
                         
          A grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards
          Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar -
          tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her
          hand. Rochester walks to her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           This girl knew nothing. She
           thought all was fair and legal.
           She never dreamt she was going to
           be entrapped into a feigned union
           with a defrauded wretch.
                         
          A tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester
          pulls her from the altar to his side.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Come, Jane, come all of you and
           meet Mrs Poole's charming
           patient. Come and meet my wife.
                         
          The sun outside is blinding. Jane closes her eyes.
                         
                         
          I/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE ENTRANCE / HALL
                         
          Rochester enters pulling Jane after him, her hand still in
          his iron grip. Wood, Mason and Briggs follow.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting.
          Adele runs forward. Rochester stops her in her tracks.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Get back! Do not come near! Go,
           all of you - keep your
           congratulations - they come
           fifteen years too late!
                         
          Adele has crumpled into frightened tears. Mrs Fairfax has
          her hand over her mouth, pale with shock. Jane meets her
          eye as Rochester pulls her up the stairs. A revelation.

          The tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks
          the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of
          Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring
          something in a pot.
                         
          Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no
          window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a
          mattress on the floor.

           Sir, you can't be bringing folk
           in here. It's madness.
                         
          Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her
          visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook
          feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           This clothed hyena is my wife.
                         
          Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows
          triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with
          Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I was duped into marriage with
           this lunatic fifteen years ago.
                         
          Briggs and Wood are deeply repelled.
                         
                          WOOD
           Let us go. We have seen enough.
                         
          Bertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on
          his shoulder; smiles at Jane, magnanimous in her victory.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           My own demon, Bertha.
                         
          With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into
          Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.
                         
          Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
          Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
          her knees, her arms behind her.
                         
          Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could
          express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane
          turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR.
                         
          Jane is coming down the stairs. Briggs is at her side.

                          BRIGGS
           You, madam, are clearly not to
           blame. Your uncle will be glad to
           hear it.
                         
          Jane looks at Briggs, only dimly comprehending him.
                         
                          BRIGGS (CONT'D)
           You wrote to your uncle, did you
           not? To inform him you were going
           to marry Mr Rochester? Mr Mason
           was staying with him when your
           letter came.
                         
          Briggs gets only a blank look of puzzlement from Jane.
                         
                          BRIGGS (CONT'D)
           Mr John Eyre has been the Madeira
           correspondent of the Mason trading
           house for some years. You can
           imagine his distress when Mason
           revealed the real state of matters.
                         
          Jane starts walking towards the sanctuary of her room.
                         
                          BRIGGS (CONT'D)
           He would have come himself but
           I'm sad to tell you that his
           health is in mortal decline. He
           implored Mr Mason to prevent this
           false marriage and referred him
           to me for assistance. I only hope
           that he survives long enough to
           hear that you are safe.
                         
          Jane opens her door. She turns to Briggs.
                         
                          JANE
           Thank you.
                         
          She shuts the door on Briggs and on the world.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane sits on her bed. She mechanically starts taking off
          the blond square she has worn as a veil.

          around her feet.

          Jane has taken a black stuff dress off its hangar. She
          slowly puts her arms around it, as if it is her old self.
          She holds it, her eyes staring at nothing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane in her underclothes, sitting down on the bed. She
          closes her eyes.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. A DRY RIVER BED.
                         
          Jane lies curled up on a rock at the bottom of a dried-up
          river bed. All of nature is suspended in stillness.
                         
          Far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the
          remote mountains. We hear the sound of the torrent
          approach.
                         
          Jane doesn't move. She has no will to flee. The sound of
          rushing water pounds in her ears. She lies, waiting to be
          dashed away. We see the flood approach and hit. A dazzling
          whiteness of water and foam.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane's room is entirely unchanged except for the fact that
          it is full of river water from floor to ceiling. Her
          bedding, furniture and belongings all sit in the room as
          normal - underwater.
                         
          The light shines murkily in through the window to reveal
          Jane floating, suspended. Her hair and her garments trail
          out. She is alive. But she is drowned.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. THORNFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          The moon has risen. Jane is lying in an exhausted doze on
          the bed. She wakes; sits up. She is faint. She recovers
          herself. She knows what she must do.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane, dressed in black in the silver light, putting her
          brush, comb and brooch in a bag. She looks in her purse.
          She has some coins.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. THORNFIELD - SECOND FLOOR.
                         
          Jane unbolts her door, takes a step out of her room, and
          stumbles into Rochester's arms. He has been keeping guard.

          His cheek has been cut by Bertha's nails.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Five minutes more of that death-
           like hush and I'd have forced the
           lock.
                         
          He examines her face. He is desperate.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           No tears. Your heart has been
           weeping blood. Forgive me.
                         
          Rochester buries his head in Jane's arms. She automatically
          comforts him.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           How could I? I am a worthless
           sinner. Don't spare me. Rain your
           tears up on me.
                         
                          JANE
           I cannot.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I deserve a hail of fire.
                         
          Jane extricates herself from his embrace.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm tired and sick. I need some
           water.
                         
          Rochester perceives Jane's inanition. He carries her down
          the gallery. Jane clings on to her bag of belongings. She
          has nothing else left.

          Rochester has lain Jane in front of the fire. She forces
          herself to eat. Rochester gives her wine. She sips.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           How are you now?
                         
                          JANE
           Much better, sir. I shall be well
           again soon.
                         
          Rochester paces away to the fire. He comes back. Stoops his
          head down to Jane to kiss her. She turns her head away.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I know you. You are thinking.
           Talking is no use; you are
           thinking how to act.

           All is changed, sir. I must
           change too.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Yes. There is no doubt that we
           both must change. I was wrong
           ever to keep you here; this
           narrow stone vault with its one
           real fiend. I'll shut it up. I'll
           pay Mrs Poole two hundred a year
           to care for its inmate and then
           no one will be harmed when she is
           prompted to burn people, to stab
           them, to bite the flesh from
           their bones -
                         
                          JANE
           Sir - you speak of her with hate -
           it is cruel. She cannot help
           being mad.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           It's not because she's mad that I
           hate her. If you were mad do you
           think that I'd hate you?
                         
                          JANE
           I do.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Then you know nothing about me,
           nothing about the way I love. Your
           mind is my treasure - and if it
           were broken it would be my treasure
           still. You are my sympathy, my
           better self, my angel. I will wrap
           my whole existence round you. Let
           us leave here tomorrow. Come with
           me - as my wife.
                         
                          JANE
           No.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'll pledge you my fidelity -
                         
                          JANE
           You can't.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You'll live a happy, most
           innocent life -
                         
                          JANE
           I must leave you, sir.

           I do love you - But I mustn't
           show it or speak it ever again. I
           must begin a new existence -
           strange scenes among strange
           faces. I must part from you.

           Must be a part of me; that's what

                          ROCHESTER
           I was tricked, duped into wedlock
           with that demon-hate, that harlot,
           that succubus upstairs. My father
           wanted her money and so I was sent
           to Spanish Town and the match was
           made. I hardly spoke with her. I
           was dazzled, ignorant, raw. My
           senses were besotted and I married
           her - gross, grovelling mole-eyed
           blockhead that I was.
                         
          Rochester sits, staring at the fire.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I lived with her for four years.
           She dragged me through all the
           degrading agonies which attend
           those bound to the intemperate and
           unchaste. Her excesses developed
           germs of madness and the doctors
           shut her up. One night, unable to
           bear her screaming hate and knowing
           I could never be rid of her, I put
           a gun to my head to kill myself.
                         
          Jane is both appalled and moved.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I would have pulled the trigger,
           died in that tropical place but for
           a breeze which blew in from the sea
           and smelt of home. With it, I came
           to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta
           Mason had abused my long suffering,
           sullied my name, outraged my honour
           and blighted my youth. It was
           enough. At that moment, as I
           decided to live, she ceased to be
           my wife.

           Only my father and brother knew of
           the marriage and by then they were
           both dead. I let my connection with

           brought her here. I have seen that
           she's cared for as her condition
           demands and that is all that God
           and humanity asks.
                         
                          JANE
           I earnestly pity you, sir.
                         
          He sees that Jane is silently crying.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane, it's not pity that I see in
           your face. It's not pity -
                         
                          JANE
           Do not say it -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           It is love.
                         
                          JANE
                          STOP -
                         
          They are holding each other.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I was wrong to deceive you. It was
           cowardly. I should have appealed to
           your spirit - as I do now - should
           have opened my life, described my
           hunger for a better existence -
           shown you my chains. I give you my
           life. I give you my pledge. Please,
           be my wife.
                         
                          JANE
           I can not.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You would be my equal.
                         
                          JANE
           How?
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I would make it so.
                         
                          JANE
           You once told me that hiring a
           mistress is the next worse thing
           to buying a slave.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Not my mistress -

                          JANE
           I would not degrade you by having
           you live with a slave.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I said wife, my wife -
                         
                         
          Jane tries to rise. Rochester keeps hold of her hand. He
          gently pulls her down again. Comforts her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Do you really mean to leave me?
                         
                          JANE
           I do.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane...
                         
          He kisses her gently, lovingly.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Do you mean it now?
                         
                          JANE
           I do.
                         
          He runs his hands over her, with great tenderness. Jane
          offers no resistance.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           And now?
                         
          Jane nods.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Oh Jane...
                         
          Rochester lays her down.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           What friends would you offend by
           living with me? Who would be
           injured? Who would care?
                         
          Jane is almost lost. She speaks in a small voice.
                         
                          JANE
           I would.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane, it would not be wicked to
           love me...
                         
                          JANE
           It would be to obey you. I care
           for myself.

          Jane's resolve grows. She resists.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           The more alone, the more friendless,
           unsustained I am, the more I must
           respect myself -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Will you listen to me?
                         
                          JANE
           I must listen to myself -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Will you hear reason?
                         
                          JANE
           Let me go -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Because if you won't I'll try
           violence.
                         
          Jane instantly stops resisting. She looks at him with utter
          shock. He is above her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           I could bend you with my finger
           and thumb; a mere reed you feel
           in my hands.
                         
          Jane neither moves nor speaks.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           But your eye; resolute, free. What
           ever I do with this cage I cannot
           get at you. And it is you, soul,
           that I want. Why don't you come of
           your own free will here, to my
           heart? Oh come, Jane, come -
                         
                          JANE
                          (CRYING OUT)
           God help me!
                         
          All the life seems to go out of Rochester. He lets Jane go.
          She pulls herself away from him. She stands. He remains,
          his face buried.
                         
          She goes to the door. Rochester turns his eyes to her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You have never called me by my
           name. My name is Edward.
                         
          Jane cannot speak it. She turns away.

          EXT. DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          First light. Jane is running; flushed, breathless, her
          dress soaked with dew. She has her bag of belongings over
          her shoulder. She trips; falls to her knees.
                         
          She looks back. For a moment she seems paralysed. She
          returns her gaze to the route ahead. Her need to escape is
          so great that she crawls forwards until she is able to
          raise herself to her feet.
                         
          She reaches the stile; lifts herself on to it; puts her
          arms around the post. She holds it, as if it were beloved.
          Her eyes close. We hear the sound of a winter blizzard.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. JANE'S COTTAGE.
                         
          Jane opens her eyes. She is sitting at her fireside.
          Outside, a snowstorm howls. On her knee is a sketchbook.
          She looks down at it.
                         
          Rochester's dark eye is beginning to appear on her paper.
          She puts a line through it; scribbles it out, blinding him.
          She stands up, trying to escape her thoughts. She whispers:
                         
                          JANE
           Edward.
                         
          There is a loud knock on the door. Jane starts.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane opening the door. Rochester is there, standing in the
          frozen hurricane and howling darkness.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Jane.
                         
          Jane pulls him inside. She falls into his arms. They
          embrace passionately. Jane is actively pulling him towards
          her, delirious with love and longing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          The exact same shot of Jane opening the door. St John
          Rivers is there, having waded through the drifting snow.
                         
                          JANE
           Mr St John - What on earth brings
           you away from your hearth on a
           night like this? Has anything
           happened? There's no bad news I
           hope?

          He takes off his cloak; stamps the snow off his boots.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           The snow was up to my waist at
           one point.
                         
                          JANE
           You are recklessly rash about
           your own health.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Nonsense.
                         
          St John's eyes alight on Jane's charcoal drawing. Jane
          snatches it away too late. There is a moment of silence.
                         
                          JANE
           Why are you come?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           An inhospitable question.
                         
                          JANE
           I mean on a night like this -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I got tired of my mute books and
           empty rooms. Besides I've been told
           half a story and I'm most impatient
           to find out the end.
                         
                          JANE
           Please...
                         
          Jane motions to St John to sit. He doesn't. She becomes
          increasingly uneasy as he speaks.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Twenty years ago, a poor curate
           fell in love with a rich man's
           daughter and married her. She was
           disowned by her family and two
           years later the rash pair were both
           dead. They left a daughter which
           charity received into her lap - as
           cold as that snow drift I almost
           stuck fast in. Charity carried the
           friendless thing to the house of
           its rich maternal relations. It was
           reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to
           names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.
                         
          Jane starts. She is on her feet.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Mrs Reed kept the orphan ten years
           and at the end of that time she was
           sent to Lowood school.

           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           It seems her career there was very
           honourable. She became a teacher
           like yourself, and left it, like
           yourself, to be a governess. She
           undertook the education of the ward
           of a certain Mr Rochester -
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rivers! -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I can guess your feelings but hear
           me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's
           character I know nothing but he
           professed to offer honourable
           marriage to this young girl and at
           the very altar she discovered that
           he had a wife yet alive. His
           subsequent conduct is a matter of
           pure conjecture but when the
           governess was enquired after it was
           discovered that she had fled
           Thornfield Hall and no trace of her
           has since been found. Now isn't
           that an odd tale?
                         
                          JANE
           Since you know so much, perhaps
           you can tell me how he is.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Who?
                         
                          JANE
           Mr Rochester; how is he?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I'm ignorant of all concerning him.
                         
          St John opens his pocket book and removes a piece of paper.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Well, since you won't ask the
           governess's name, I must tell
           you. I have it written down here
           in black and white.
                         
          He hands her the paper. On it are doodled the heads of some
          of her pupils. She has absently written Jane Eyre in the
          margin several times.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           A solicitor named Briggs wrote to
           me of a Jane Eyre. I knew a Jane
           Elliott. This paper resolved my
           suspicion into certainty.

                          JANE
           The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does
           he have any news of Mr Rochester?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Are you not going to enquire why
           he has gone to such lengths to
           find you?
                         
                          JANE
           What does he want with me?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Merely to tell you that your uncle,
           Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead;
           that he has left you all his
           property and that you are now rich.
                         
                          JANE
           What?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You are rich; quite an heiress.
                         
          Silence. Jane is flabbergasted.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Your fortune is vested in the
           English funds; Briggs has the
           will and all the necessary
           documents. You can enter on
           immediate possession.
                         
          At last, Jane looks questioningly up at him.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Your forehead unbends at last; I
           thought you were turning to
           stone. Perhaps now you will ask
           how much you are worth.
                         
                          JANE
           How much am I worth?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand
           pounds - but what of that?
                         
          The news literally takes Jane's breath away.
                         
                          JANE
           Twenty thousand pounds?
                         
          St John begins to laugh at Jane's reaction. She has never
          seen him laugh before.

                          ST JOHN
           If you'd committed a murder and
           I'd found you out, you could
           scarcely look more aghast.
                         
                          JANE
           There must be some mistake. It's
           two thousand, surely.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           It's twenty. You look desperately
           miserable about it, I must say.
                         
          Jane still cannot take it in. She frowns in disbelief.
                         
                          JANE
           Why did Mr Briggs write to you?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You see, that is the strange thing.
           It makes me wonder what power or
           providence led you to our door.
           Your name is Jane Eyre.
                         
                          JANE
           Yes.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Then I'm you namesake. I was
           christened St John Eyre Rivers.
                         
                          JANE
           St John Eyre -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           My mother had two brothers, one was
           a clergyman, your father, the other
           was John Eyre of Madeira. Mr Briggs
           wrote to inform us that the
           clergyman's daughter was lost. I
           have been able to find her out;
           that is all.
                         
                          JANE
           Your mother was my father's
           sister?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Yes.
                         
                          JANE
           My uncle John was your uncle
           John?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           That is correct.

                          JANE
           So you, Diana and Mary -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           We are cousins, yes.
                         
          Jane is deeply moved.
                         
                          JANE
           Oh, I am glad! - I am glad!
                         
          She throws her arms around St John. Tears of happiness
          start to flow. He, finding it peculiar to be held, gently
          tries to calm her.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Here you are neglecting essential
           points to pursue trifles. You were
           utterly downhearted when I told you
           that you were rich and now, for a
           matter of no moment, you are
           deliriously happy.
                         
                          JANE
           Of no moment? You have sisters and
           maybe don't care for a cousin but I
           have nobody. I have been alone,
           always. And now three relations are
           born into my world full grown. Oh, I
           am glad. You, who saved my life -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You must try to tranquillise your
           feelings.
                         
          Jane finally releases him, still radiant with joy.
                         
                          JANE
           Write to Diana and Mary. Tell
           them to hand in notice and come
           home. They will have five
           thousand each and so will you.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I've told you the news too quickly.
           You're confused.
                         
                          JANE
           Don't put me out of patience,
           cousin. I am rational enough.
           Twenty thousand divided equally
           between the nieces and nephews of
           our uncle, gives five to each.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           This is acting on first impulse.
           You don't know what it is to have
                          WEALTH -

                          JANE
           And you cannot imagine - family -
           I never had a home. I never had
           brothers and sisters -
                         
          A terrible thought occurs to her.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           You are not reluctant to own me,
           are you?
                         
          St John takes her hand. She has surprised and moved him. He
          looks at her, seeing her anew.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Jane, I will be your brother.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. SPRING - THE MOORS.
                         
          Jane, Diana and Mary are running over the moors. Mary has a
          kite. They are as delighted as children.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MOOR HOUSE - THE KITCHEN.
                         
          Jane is sitting at the table letting Diana style her hair.
          They all have new summer dresses on. There is a lightness
          to all three as if a great weight has been lifted from
          their shoulders.
                         
          Diana is setting Jane's hair into curls like her own. Jane
          looks at herself in the mirror; softer, gentler, different.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE PARLOUR.
                         
          The girls each have a candle. St John kisses Mary. He
          kisses Diana.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Good night.
                         
                          DIANA
           You call Jane your sister but you
           don't treat her as such. You should
           kiss her too.
                         
          Jane turns to Diana, embarrassed.
                         
                          JANE
           Di, you are very provoking.
                         
          As she turns back, she finds St John's face right in front
          of her. He kisses her. A kiss with no warmth; an
          experiment. He examines its effect. He is satisfied.

                          ST JOHN
           Good night.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM.
                         
          Jane closes the door. She puts her hand across her lips.
          The icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her
          loneliness. She curls up in a ball, desperate.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. MOOR HOUSE - THE GARDEN.
                         
          A glorious summer sunset. Jane is digging at a flower bed,
          putting all her passion into the task. She is flushed with
          exertion. St John watches.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You are wasted here.
                         
                          JANE
           Am I not being useful?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You should look beyond Moor
           House, beyond the selfish calm
           and comfort of affluence.
                         
                          JANE
           Beyond to what?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I go to India in six weeks.
                         
                          JANE
           So soon? -
                         
          St John draws Jane away from her work.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I can see what your gifts are and
           why they were given. Come with me.
                         
          Jane is utterly crestfallen.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           God and nature intended you for a
           missionary's wife. You are formed
           for labour not for love. I want
           to claim you - not for my
           pleasure but for God's service.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm not fit for it. I have no
           vocation.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           You're far too humble.

                          JANE
           St John have mercy. I feel my
           mind shrinking -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Don't be afraid. You are diligent,
           faithful, docile, courageous,
           gentle and heroic. Cease to
           mistrust yourself. I trust you
           unreservedly. Let me give you time
           to think. But know this; in you, I
           recognise a fellow soul, a soul
           that would revel in the flame and
           excitement of sacrifice.
                         
          Jane is chilled to the bone by his words. St John leaves
          the garden and walks away over the moors.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane leaning against the garden wall, trying to think,
          trying to compose herself. The sun is setting.
                         
                         
          INT. NIGHT. MOOR HOUSE - THE PARLOUR.
                         
          Jane carrying a candle, opens the door. St John is at the
          table working by lamp light. The moon shines brightly in.
                         
                          JANE
           I used to long for a life of
           action, to overleap the horizon, to
           move in the world of men. Maybe God
           is giving me this. And what is
           there for me here? Pain and longing
           for what can't be. I don't know how
           long I would survive in India. My
           frame isn't strong. But I'll go
           with you, if I may go free.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Free?
                         
                          JANE
           You and I had better not marry.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why not?
                         
                          JANE
           Because I am your sister.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           But you'll go with me.
                         
                          JANE
           Conditionally - as your curate.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 110.
                         
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Jane, I don't need a curate; I
           need a wife.
                         
                          JANE
           I must have my heart and mind
           free, my own self to turn to. I
           couldn't become part of you -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           A part of me you must become or the
           whole bargain is void. How can I, a
           man not yet thirty take out to
           India a girl of nineteen, unless
           she is my wife? Don't offer God
           half a sacrifice. He must have all.
           And undoubtedly enough of love
           would follow to make the union
           right, even in your eyes.
                         
          Jane is shocked.
                         
                          JANE
           Enough of love?
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Yes, quite enough.
                         
                          JANE
           St John, I scorn your idea of
           love. I scorn the counterfeit
           sentiment you offer and I scorn
           you when you offer it!
                         
          St John is mortified. A slow rage begins to boil in him.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I've uttered nothing that
           deserves scorn.
                         
                          JANE
           Forgive me but the very name of
           love is an apple of discord
           between us. My dear cousin,
           please abandon your scheme of
           marriage.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           No; and if you reject it, it's
           not me you deny but God.
                         
          Jane is stung. St John has turned from her. His face is icy
          in the moonlight.
                         
                          JANE
           Do not be angry with me please.
           It makes me wretched. I want us
           to be friends.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 111.
                         
                         
                          ST JOHN
           We are friends. I hope we can be
           more.
                         
                          JANE
           I cannot come as your wife.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why this refusal? It makes no
           sense!
                         
                          JANE
           If I were to marry you, you'd
           kill me. You're killing me now.
                         
                          ST JOHN
                          (FURIOUS)
           I'd kill you? I am killing you?
           Your words are violent, unfeminine
           and untrue -
                         
                          JANE
           You'd kill me without drawing any
           blood or receiving on your
           conscience any stain of crime.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           What nonsense is this?
                         
                          JANE
           You'd experience no pain - but I
           tell you it would kill me!
                         
                          ST JOHN
           Why?
                         
                          JANE
           Because I would inevitably come to
           conceive love for you, because you
           are so talented and good, because
           there is such grandeur in your
           look. You wouldn't want this
           strange and torturing love; if I
           showed it you would find it
           unbecoming. And my lot would be
           wretched.
                         
                          ST JOHN
                          (UNDERSTANDING HER)
           Jane...
                         
                          JANE
           You're a good man, but you forget
           the feelings of little people. We'd
           better keep out of your way lest
           you trample us.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 112.
                         
                         
          St John's anger has faded. He is compassionate. This is far
          harder to resist.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I wouldn't trample you. You'd
           walk at my side towards God's
           altar. He'd be your solace,
           heaven your reward. We seek to do
           the greatest work, to open
           death's gates, to save souls.
           Love God Jane, love God.
                         
          St John puts his hand on her forehead; Christlike. Jane is
          falling under his power.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Give up your heart to Him. He is
           love.
                         
          Jane falls to her knees. St John's face is angelic.
                         
                          JANE
           If I were sure; if I were certain -
                         
          She suddenly hears a voice: Rochester's; clear, urgent.
                         
           ROCHESTER (O.S.)
           Jane! Jane! Jane!
                         
          She springs away from St John, crying:
                         
                          JANE
           Oh God, what is it?
                         
          She looks wildly about the room; rushes to the window.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           What have you heard? What can you
           see?
                         
          Jane glances at him, seeing him for what he is; a cold,
          controlling man. She shouts:
                         
                          JANE
           I am coming!
                         
          She runs out, leaving St John aghast, behind her.
                         
                         
          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane runs on to the moors.
                         
                          JANE
           Wait for me!
                         
          She looks all around her at the moonlit landscape.

                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Where are you?
                         
          The moors send her question back in an echo. We see Jane's
          face. Her path is clear.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. WHITCROSS MOOR.
                         
          Jane is waiting for the coach at the crossroads where she
          arrived, almost a year before. It comes pounding towards
          her. She hails it. This time, the coachman respectfully
          descends to take her bag and help her on. She is so
          confident and so changed that he doesn't recognise her.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          Jane is walking through the orchard. It is wild, neglected.
          Its untended state worries her. She looks up. Rooks are
          circling, cawing.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane finds herself at the side of the house. The ground is
          pitted with weeds. The windows are dark. She half runs
          round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.
                         
          The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.
          Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
          collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred
          remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.
          Jane gazes in horror and distress.
                         
                         
          I/E. DAY. MRS FAIRFAX'S COTTAGE
                         
          Jane knocks on the door. Mrs Fairfax opens it.
                         
                          JANE
           They sent me from the inn. I've
           been up at the house -
                         
          Jane can say no more.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Come in, come in.
                         
                          JANE
           Is he dead?
                         
          Mrs Fairfax takes Jane in her arms.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           No, no. Mr Rochester still lives.
                         
          Jane is crying tears of relief.

                          JANE
           Tell me - please -
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Why did you run away in the night
           like that? I would have helped. I
           would have helped.
                         
                         
          INT. DAY. MRS FAIRFAX'S COTTAGE
                         
          Mrs Fairfax has sat Jane on a settle near the fire.
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           He sought you as if you were a lost
           and precious jewel. He didn't rest.
           And as days turned into weeks and
           no word came, he grew quite savage
           in his disappointment.
                         
                          JANE
           He stayed at Thornfield?
                         
                          MRS FAIRFAX
           Didn't leave the house...
                         
                         
          I/E. DAY. THORNFIELD - THE FRONT DOOR/GROUNDS.
                         
          Rochester, unshaven and unkempt is standing at his
          threshold.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           Shut himself up like a hermit. He
           only went out at night, when he
           walked like a ghost through the
           grounds.
                         
          We see what he is looking at: an open carriage piled with
          luggage, into which Mrs Fairfax is helping Adele. Leah and
          Sophie are already sitting inside, dressed for a journey.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'd have no one near him. Adele
           was sent off to school. He placed
           me here. Only John and Martha
           stayed - and Mrs Poole of course.
                         
          Adele looks back at Rochester with tears in her eyes. He
          walks across the dark hall and slams the library doors.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE ORCHARD.
                         
          Rochester, in his shirt sleeves, is looking at the tree
          where Jane promised him her hand - now dying, cleft by
          lightning. The rising moon inhabits the sky.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 115.
                         
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           It was harvest time when it
           happened. No one knows how she
           got out.
                         
          Rochester hears a cry from the top floor. He sets off, a
          look of finality on his face.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE KITCHEN.
                         
          Grace Poole is asleep, her empty jug of gin beside her.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           My theory is that when Mrs Poole
           was asleep, having taken too much
           of the gin and water...
                         
          Rochester takes Grace's keys.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE THIRD FLOOR
                         
          Rochester opens the door to the inner chamber.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           ... The mad lady must have stolen
           her keys and let herself out.
                         
          Bertha Antoinetta Mason, standing in the last patch of
          daylight thrown down from her skylight, sees that it is
          Rochester. She calmly walks towards him.
                         
          Rochester graciously bows, indicating that she may leave.
          Bertha glides past him. She is free.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE GALLERY
                         
          Bertha walks past an elegant vase. She tips it to the
          floor. It smashes. Rochester pays it no heed.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LIBRARY.
                         
          Rochester has stood Bertha at his desk. A case of jewels is
          open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond
          necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She
          turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned.
          Bertha begins to laugh.
                         
          She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires
          herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers,
          the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge
          curtains alight.

          Rochester is impassive; he does nothing to stop her. As she
          passes, Rochester realises he is bleeding. She has run the
          brooch pin across him.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE HALL/STAIRS.
                         
          Bertha knocks a lamp onto the floor. The oil springs into
          flames, licking the tapestries and the paintings. Rochester
          sees his ancestors begin to burn.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE SECOND FLOOR
                         
          The conflagration is growing. Rochester sees Bertha leaving
          Jane's room. As he passes, he sees everything inside it
          being consumed by fire. He can't bear to look.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. THORNFIELD - THE LEADS.
                         
          Bertha is watching the rooks. Rochester goes to the edge of
          the roof. Bertha looks at him. The invitation is clear.
          Rochester is ready to die.
                         
          Bertha sees the rooks wheeling away. She runs at the edge
          of the roof. Rochester sees her intention too late. He puts
          out his arm to stop her.
                         
          For the perfect fraction of a second, Bertha flies.
          Rochester sees her fall; almost falls himself - saves
          himself.
                         
          Life reawakens in him. Behind him, he sees Grace Poole,
          coughing, crawling up through the door.
                         
                          GRACE
           Antoinetta?
                         
          Responsibility floods over him. He goes to her side, lifts
          Grace, helps her down the stairs.
                         
           MRS FAIRFAX (V.O.)
           He didn't leave the house until
           everyone was out. Some say it was a
           just judgement on him for having
           her confined there all those years
           but for my part, I pity him.

           When he was taken out from under
           the ruins, a beam had fallen in
           such a way as to protect him,
           partly - but his eye was taken
           out and his left hand so crushed
           that he lost it. The other eye
           inflamed and - he is blind. He's
           blind.
                         
          Tears fall from Jane's eyes.

           he was mad.
                         
          A great sense of urgency is coming over her.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           Where is he?
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
          Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
          to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
          granite pillars. She walks through them.
                         
          She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
          house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
          grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
                         
          Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
          is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
          brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
          sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
          hawk. His strength is undiminished.
                         
          He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
          the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
          for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
          silent.
                         
          A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
          right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
          as if he is looking for something from there. He is
          absolutely still; his expression, serene.
                         
          Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
          loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
          immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.
          Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.
                         
                         
          He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
          it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
          Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
                         
          He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
          and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
          into the dark interior.
                         
          Jane starts to breathe again.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. FERNDEAN - THE SIDE ENTRANCE.
                         
          Jane lightly taps on the side door. Martha opens it; she is
          astonished. Jane puts her finger over her lips.
                         
                         
          INT. EVENING. FERNDEAN - THE DRAWING ROOM.
                         
          Rochester is in an armchair in front of his fire. Pilot is
          at his feet. Jane carries in a tray with a candelabra and a
          jug of water.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I can see the candles, Martha, at
           your side like a luminous glow.
           And the fire; a red haze.
                         
          Pilot notices Jane. He leaps up with a whine, wagging his
          tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help
          finding it funny. Her entrance has been ruined by the dog.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Martha?
                         
          Jane giggles. Rochester's face falls.
                         
                          ROCHESTER (CONT'D)
           Martha, is that you?
                         
                          JANE
           Martha is in the kitchen, sir.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Who's there?
                         
                          JANE
           Pilot knows me. Will you have
           some more water? I've spilt half
           the glass.
                         
          Rochester stands, holding out his hand.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           If you are real, touch me.
                         
          Jane touches his fingers; puts her hand in his. Rochester
          pulls her into his arms.

                          JANE
           I've been with good people; far
           better than you, quite more
           refined and exalted.

                          JANE
           And I'm an independent woman. My
           uncle in Madeira died and left me
           five thousand pounds -
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           This is real. This is practical.
                         
                          JANE
           I'm here. I'm home. I am where I
           love best.

          Jane curled on Rochester's knee by the fire. He is running
          his fingers over her face, feeling its contours.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           You're altogether a human being,

           I conscientiously believe so,

           But I see that you're turning

           undertook to rehumanise you.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           I'm a sightless block -

           I know.
                         
          She kisses his eyes.
                         
                          JANE (CONT'D)
           And the worst of it is, I'm in
           danger of loving you too well for
           this, and making too much of you.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           Am I hideous, Jane?
                         
                          JANE
           Very. But you always were, you
           know.
                         
          A smile cracks Rochester's face.
                         
          Jane runs her fingers over it, feeling its contours.
                         
          He holds her.
                         
          Silence falls.

              He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter
              than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just
              out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats
              the first baseman's butt.  Gotcha.

              A wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink
              with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY
              MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal
              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes
              and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic
              instrumental, "The Lonely Bull."

              INT. SMI CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
 
              The SMI agents are a fierce, happy bunch.  They sit in a
              carefully appointed conference room.
 
              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs
              of global marketing are omnipresent.  Each agent has a silver
              tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water.
              Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up
              into many cubicles.


                                                                     4.

              Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire.  The word
              "millions" appears often and easily in his conversation.

              INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY
 
              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility
              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering
              media members move in on the car. ("Baja!!"  "Baja, over
              here!!")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with
              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.

                        fired the shot in the 7/l1?
 
              Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking
              him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the
              police department.  Professional smile in place, Maguire
              attempts spin.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen, there's no proof of
                        anything except that this guy is
                        a sensational athlete.
 
              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the
              press.
 
              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY
 
              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old
              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.
              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little
              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.
 
                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you
                        sign my card?


                                                                     5.
 
 
              Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face.
 
                                  CALVIN NACK
                        I'm sorry little fella.  I can't
                        sign that particular brand of
                        card.  I can only sign Pro-Jam
                        Blue Dot cards.
 
              The Little Boy looks confused. As Calvin Nack turns to grab
              an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a
              business card to the little boy.

              INT. HOSPITAL BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Hockey Player STEVE REMO, 33, is a big man in a small bed.
              He is in traction, with concussion.  DOCTOR stands nearby,
              shoots Jerry a look of concern.  Family is nearby.
 
                                  DOCTOR
                        Do you know your name?
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                        I uh... wait.  Wait, here it
                        comes. I have it.  My name is
                        Steve Remo. I play for the
                        Blackhawks.
                               (now on a roll)
                        You are my son.  This pretty lady
                        is my wife.  And you are...
 
              Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face.
 
                                  STEVE REMO

                        And I gotta play this weekend,
                        Doc. If I play in 65% of the
                        games, I make my bonus.
 
              EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
              player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.


                                                                     6.
 
 
                                  SON
                        This is his fourth concussion.
                        Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 
              As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (glib, easy)
                        Come on -- it'd take a tank to
                        stop your dad.  It would take all
                        five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
                        right?
 
              The kid stares at Maguire.  It feels as if the kid is peering
              into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
 
                                  SON
                        Fuck you.
 
              The kid turns and exits in disgust.  He leaves Jerry standing
              in the hallway.  Devastated. Music.
 
              EXT. RENTAL CAR SHUTTLE -- DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.  Passing through
              frame. Music.  Phone still ringing.
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Jerry sleeps.

                        Breakthrough.
 
              Jerry's eyes open.  Breathing strangely.  Trembling, he holds
              onto the nightstand for grounding.
 
              He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar.
              Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across
              his face.  This feeling is new to him.

                        It was the oddest, most unexpected
                        thing.  I began writing what they
                        call a Mission Statement for my
                        company. You know -- a Mission
                        Statement -- a suggestion for the
                        future.


                                                                     7.
 
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby.
              we watch his face, alive now.
 
              There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
              words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow
              moist.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        What started out as one page
                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was
                        my father's son.  I was
                        remembering the simple pleasures
                        of this job, how I ended up here
                        out of law school, the way a
                        stadium sounds when one of my
                        players performs well on the
                        field... I was remembering even
                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,
                        the original sports agent, who
                        said:
 
              SHOT OF DICKY FOX
 
                                  DICKY FOX
                        The key to this job is personal
                        relationships.
 
              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        And suddenly it was all pretty
                        clear. The answer was fewer
                        clients.  Caring for them, caring
                        for ourselves, and the games too.
                        Starting our lives, really.
 
              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal
              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
 
              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.

                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit
                        it. What I was writing was
                        somewhat "touchy feely."
 
              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and
              continues on, boldly.


                                                                     8.

                        I didn't care.  I had lost the
                        ability to bullshit.  It was the

                        I printed it up in the middle of
                        the night, before I could re-think
                        it.
 
              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first
              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,
              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the
              counter, for Jerry's approval.

                        That's how you become great, man.
                        You hang your ba11s out there.
 
              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a
              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.

              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
 
              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.
              He looks younger, lighter.
 
              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)
 
              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing
              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.
              ("Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea
              who it was?")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he
              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,
              and dials with urgency.


                                                                     9.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh,
                        listen did those manuscripts
                        get... Oh they did... No no no no
                        no, that's fine...
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry in suit, alone with his
                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,
                        holds onto the handrail to steady
                        himself.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- DAY
 
              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission
              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously
              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the
              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB
              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.
              ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins
              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks
              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26
              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission
              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry
              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen
              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.

                        I was 35.  I had started my life.
 
              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping
              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the
              other.

              INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT
 
              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but
              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working
              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.
              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy
              phone conversation with her boyfriend.


                                                                     10.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,
                        listen... I'm not going to say it
                        here.... no...
 
              Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's
              low.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        ...  oh listen, I got you the
                        perfect white shirt, at this out
                        of the way place... no... quit
                        trying to make me say it!
 
              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying
              not to listen.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        how about if I do it and don't say
                        it... mmmm... see you soon...
 
              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed
              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have to ask.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (protective)
                        What --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Where'd you find the perfect white
                        shirt?
 
              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
 
              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.


                                                                     11.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, my son is allergic to the
                        material in these blankets -
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                        That's all we have.
 
              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to
              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to
              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's okay.  We're in it together
                        now...
 
              The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't take anything I say
                        seriously! I love to flirt!
 
              Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the
              heads that belong to these voices.
 
              BACK TO JERRY AND WOMAN
 
                                  WOMAN

                        Well.  Good luck with that --
 
              He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light.  Politely
              stifles another yawn.  He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep.
              Bobbi leans into his darkness.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Can I just get a quick "man's"
                        opinion from you on something?

              INT.  FIRST CLASS SEATS -- LATER
 
              Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens
              like a priest.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        And I can't say his name without
                        laughing I want to eat him up. I
                        want to say goodbye to every bad
                        thought I ever had about
                        relationships.  I mean, I crave
                        this guy... and yet... why... why
                        did I have that affair this
                        weekend?  Does that mean I'm not
                        in love with my boyfriend?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you'll know when you see
                        him at the gate.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        It's the death rattle of my
                        singlehood, right? Because I
                        finally see the white picket fence
                        looming and I love it/hate it/love
                        it/hate it/ love it... you're
                        right, I'll know when I see him.
                        Why is it so easy to talk with
                        you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
 
              Maguire fights another yawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I uh... don't think we're quite at
                        your pitch yet.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Tell me, and then you can sleep.

                        every moment of her life, which is
                        why I should take a nap now...

              Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen.

                        --so our first date, she told me
                        about her favorite place in the
                        world, the seven pools of Hana on
                        the island of Maui...

                        A year-and-a-half later, we were
                        both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.
                        Now I've always hit a wall at 18
                        months.  Every serious girlfriend
                        lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka-
                        boom.  The curse of 18 months.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        That's when you need to cement,
                        and define define define.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Exactly.  And the world does not
                        need another 35 year-old bachelor.
                        I knew I wanted to propose, so I
                        took her there.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        To the pools?
 
                                  JERRY
                        To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock
                        Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock
                        Climber, but we're hiking up
                        through the pools and there's a
                        fine mist in the air, and I have
                        the ring in my pocket, and I'm a
                        little nervous, I'm lagging
                        behind, and she says to me, get
                        this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh no --

                                  JERRY
                        Well, it bothered me somewhat.
                        And I got quiet.  And now she's
                        quiet and we're both pouting a
                        little, you know.  And I decide
                        I'm not going to propose.  The
                        mood is not right. Why be
                        impulsive? Now at this point I
                        know she knows that I was going to
                        propose and didn't.  And she knows
                        I know.  So the entire sixty mile
                        ride back to the airport, we don't
                        speak. And we're both good at
                        that.  We fly to Honolulu in
                        silence.  We check into the Pro
                        Bowl hotel --
 
                                  WOMAN
                        How sad --
 
                                  JERRY
                        But wait...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story.
              The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of
              Jerry discussing his charmed life.
 
                                  RAY
                               (waking up)
                        Mama --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
 
              He sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more
              kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now little do I know that my
                        assistant. has assumed that I've
                        now proposed. So she has gotten
                        the lounge band to actually play
                        "Here Comes The Bride" when we
                        walk back in.
 
              Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to
              share the laugh with her son, who stares at her.


                                                                     15.
 
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        Which they do.  And we're standing
                        there. All the football guys are
                        in the lobby, watching, there's
                        even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to
                        her and sort of grandly say,
                        "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking
                        you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to
                        marry me." And I took out the
                        ring, and I don't much like big
                        scenes, but she said "yes" right
                        there in the lobby and some of the
                        toughest men in football wept like
                        babies.  We're getting married in
                        February.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Jerry.  You two will be together
                        forever.
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant
              Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy
              blows her nose, moved against her will.
 
                                  RAY
                        What's wrong, mom?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        First class is what's wrong.  It
                        used to be a better meal.  Now
                        it's a better life.
 
              She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been
              listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read.
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
 
              Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quietly, like a
                                coach)
                        You'll know when you see him.
                        You'll know when you see him.
 
              Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
              in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He
              holds flowers.


                                                                     16.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh my God, you're right.  I know.
                               (Jerry smiles)
                        He's not The One.  He's not the
                        One.
 
              Jerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
              faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
              couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
              crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
              loved ones.  Music.
 
              INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
              conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the
              background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Ray! Ray!
 
              Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the
              dark depths behind the flaps.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I help?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office.
                        I was on the junket to the
                        conference. I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know who y6u are.  You're
                        Dorothy Boyd.  You're in...
                        wait... you're in Accounts.  You
                        have the middle cubicle toward the
                        back with that poster of Albert
                        Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0
                        Neal's body.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Hmm.  Pretty good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now what did you lose?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My son... my mind...
 
              Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
              riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
              Delaware.


                                                                     17.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, while I go look for him, why
                        don't you hang onto this curious
                        gentleman behind you --
 
              Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
              him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks
              softly but intensely, with no frills.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Remember "imagination?"...
                        remember what that means?  Well,
                        this is one of my bosses so you
                        will now IMAGINE me screaming at
                        you right now. Do NOT do that
                        again.  Ever ever EVER.
 
              She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young
              woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a
              day.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Well, thanks.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, take care.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And have fun at your bachelor
                        party.
 
              Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy
              freezes.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Oh no.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no. I knew.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (slow sigh)
                        Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm just... anxiously looking
                        past it.  I already had my
                        bachelor party.  It was called "my
                        twenties." See you later.
 
              Jerry takes off.


                                                                     18.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I loved your memo, by the way.
 
              He stops.  Turns.  She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
              purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks... actually, it was just a
                        "Mission Statement."
 
              Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think in this age, optimism like
                        that... it's a revolutionary act.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eager for feedback)
                        You think so?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh tsht. Yes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I appreciate that, because some of
                        that stuff... you know, it was two
                        in the morning and...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- the part about "we should
                        embrace what it is still virginal
                        about our enthusiasm" --
 
              Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
              words.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        -- "and we should all force open
                        the tightly-clenched fist of
                        commerce, and give a little back
                        for the greater good.". I mean, I
                        was inspired, and I'm an
                        accountant.  Ray, don't spill my
                        coffee.
 
              Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
              hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three... swing.


                                                                     19.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey.  To respect yourself enough
                        to say it out loud, to put
                        yourself out there, so openly...
                               (shakes her head)
                        ... I don't know, it got me.
 
              Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three, swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.  May I offer you both a
                        ride?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh no.  I'm sure it would just
                        make your day to drive us all the
                        way to Manhattan Beach, taking
                        that left down to little tiny
                        Waterloo street where you have to
                        play chicken with oncoming
                        traffic, and your life flashes
                        before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
                        obviously had too much coffee and
                        all -- here's my sister Laurel to
                        pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (amused)
                        Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two...
 
              Jerry lets Ray down easy.  The kid is a little disappointed.
              But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
              He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
              Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        ... three, swing.
 
              Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits.  Dorothy
              laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
              no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
              on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, I'm double-parked.
 
              Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
              gathering Ray's toys.  She wipes at Ray's hair.


                                                                     20.
 
 
              ("Don't put food in your hair.")   She is surprised that
              she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
              She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
              looking.   He salutes her, with mock circumstance.  She
              returns it with a guilty smile.  He disappears, and she finds
              herself oddly short of breath.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must
                        be some classy babe --
 
              INT. AVERY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              AVERY BISHOR, 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch.
              They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't ever stop fucking me!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sooner... or later... I'll have to
                        stop.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been
                        better. Never BETTER!!
 
              Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Never BETTER!!
 
              The dog snaps awake, a little shook.  Avery suddenly yanks
              away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
              serious business with Avery.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Open your eyes.
                               (he does)
                        If you ever want me to be with
                        another woman for you, I would do
                        it.  I'm not interested in it.
                        There was a time, yes, it felt
                        normal for me, but it was a phase,
                        a college thing, like torn Levi's
                        or law school for you... people
                        change, but if you ever feel like
                        being adventurous in that way, I
                        would do it for you.  You want
                        anything from the kitchen I'm
                        going to get some fruit --


                                                                     21.
 
 
              She skips off like a colt.  Jerry digests what he's just been
              told.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to the next room)
                        You know.  I don't think we need
                        to do the thing where we tell each
                        other everything!
 
                                  AVERY (O.S.)
                               (laughing)
                        Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
 
              Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex
              information.
 
                                  AVERY (0.5.)
                        Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
                        have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
 
                                  JERRY (0.5.)
                        I know about the bachelor party.
 
              Avery returns.  Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway,
              is a glorious life-long project.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Who told you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        One of the accountants.
 
              She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking
              his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at
              body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked
                        his ass off to make you a tribute
                        film. All those guys from the
                        office are coming.  Everybody
                        loves you.  Just calm down, relax,
                        act surprised, and have an amazing
                        time.  And you'll never guess who
                        narrates your bachelor movie.
 
              INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He
              falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks
              around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets.
 
              THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.
 
              It is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN.


                                                                     22.
 
 
                                  MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I have often wondered where my
                        career would have been had Jerry
                        Maguire been my agent.  The
                        answer -- Yugoslavia.
 
              Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
              looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
              friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
              on steroids.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        You hear those courtesy laughs,
                        Jerry? There is a seething
                        wrongness at the edges of this
                        party.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh come on --
 
                                  DOOLER
                        This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
                        man! They should be screaming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eying crowd)
                        You're imagining it.
 
              They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a
              Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        We still having lunch tomorrow,
                        Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton
                        tested positive for marijuana.
                        That moves Cush solidly up to
                        numero uno in the draft.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Oh, that'll really help this
                        party! Let's all talk business!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (smoothly)
                        The best commercial director in
                        the business.  I hail you.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Sorry I yelled.  You have
                        exquisite taste.


                                                                     23.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Everybody's having a great time.
                        You're both nuts -- the movie's
                        great.
 
              Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        I like that guy.
 
              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)
 
                                  JERRY
                               (wounded good sport)
                        ... this is... uh... too funny...
 
                                  DOOLER
                        They ain't laughing, man.
                        Something's wrong.
 
              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks
              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
              Knoll.


                                                                     24.
 
 
              He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
              encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
              conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
              sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
              The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
              his back office.
 
                                  WENDY
                               (as in 'get ready')
                        Marcee's here.  She's already in
                        your office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks, Wendy.
 
              INT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
              waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already
              standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE
              TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking
              smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee.  How's my favorite
                        player's wife?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Jerry, Rod is very very upset.
                        Tyson, no!
 
              Across the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry
              a plexiglass case off the wall.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tyson, hello.
 
              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
              habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis
              mode like an old shirt.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        How can I make your life better?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I know you say to take the Arizona
                        offer, but my husband needs more
                        recognition.

                                  SUGAR
                        Sorry to interrupt you guys.
 
              Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
              level of intensity.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Now I don't know what you do for
                        your five-percent, but this man,
                        my husband has a whole plan, an
                        image... we majored in marketing,
                        Jerry, and when you put him in a
                        Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
                        excuse me, you are making him
                        common.  He is pure gold and
                        you're giving him "Waterbed
                        Warehouse" when he deserves the
                        big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
                        line, soft-drink.  The four jewels
                        of the celebrity endorsement
                        dollar.
 
              Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
              best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        You gonna get that --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not a chance.
 
              She smiles.

                                                                     26.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Marcee, things are changing around
                        here.  You and Rod will have my
                        total personal attention.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (upping the ante)
                        Damn right, and you can start by
                        taking Rod's poster and putting it
                        where people can see it!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it's infectious)
                        Damn right.
 
              He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
              poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
              the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Look at that handsome man, trying
                        to build a life up there by the
                        air-conditioner. We're coming to
                        get ya, darlin!  We are so close
                        to having it all!
 
              ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
 
              It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
              second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,
              27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl
              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.
              Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash
              ("Tyson!").
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON
 
              Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
              sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
                        Arizona contract... new glass
                        cabinet...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking up)
                        I'm fine.  What's up?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I came here to let you go.


                                                                     27.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Pardon me?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 
              For a long moment there is only silence.  They study each
              other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
              other's next three or four moves.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        It's real, Jerry.  You... you
                        should say something.
 
              Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit...the crowded
                        restaurant... so there's no
                        scene...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
 
              In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
              "Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You...
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (razor sharp)
                        You did this to yourself.  You
                        said "fewer clients."  You put it
                        all on paper.  Scully was very
                        upset.  Heart attacks make some
                        people sweeter, but not him.  You
                        did this to yourself --
 
              Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
              speak, Sugar continues.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        -- although I do gotta hand it to
                        you.  For about five minutes you
                        had everyone applauding smaller
                        revenues.
 
              Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You... ungrateful... unctuous...


                                                                     28.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (unctuous)
                        ... dick?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dick.
 
              Maguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes
              jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Give me a little credit for doing
                        this face-to-face!  What I went
                        through knowing I was going to do
                        this to my mentor!  Can you get
                        past yourself for a second?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You'll lose.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (musically)
                        You wanted smaller.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm over it.  Now I want all my
                        clients and yours too.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Jerry --
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- and I'll get 'em.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (patronizing)
                        You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
                        Always always always.  We're
                        bringing other elements in, we're
                        focusing on endorsements -- it's
                        not about handholding anymore.
                        We're no longer babysitters --
 
              Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the
              table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
              Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
              mind.  Rising percussive music.
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
              lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.


                                                                     29.
 
 
              INT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone.
 
              INT. SMI ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing.  Dorothy Boyd
              sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a
              good time.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to
              the back office.  Music
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a
              breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom
              drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer,
              a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third
              smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he
              dials.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY
 
              Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young
              football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still
              playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks.
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the
              personality of whomever he talks to.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob
                        Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
                        first 'cause you're the most
                        important guy in sports...
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax
              into the machine at the same time.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Carla, right now you're paying 25%
                        of your endorsments to SMI, I
                        would cut my commission by 7%...
 
              As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once
              proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom
              drawer.


                                                                     30.
 
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You read that memo I snuck to you,
                        the guy's tired of the job.  Tired
                        of making you money.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all
              while he talks quickly on the phone.
 
                                  JERRY

                        contract in Chicago, and the fan
                        poll in the Sun-Times was 93%

              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the
              right and left of her are the phones are ringing.


                                                                     31.
 
 
              Something is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts
              Exec CLEO, 32.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What's going on?

                        They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it
                        at Cronin's.
 
              Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat.
              She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her
              roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office
              door.

              KATHY SANDERS, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch.
              Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past
              endorsements. Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the
              Olympics. Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her,
              listening in on the extension.  The Mission Statement is
              folded open on Dad's lap.  Kathy chokes on every other word,
              such is her anguish.
 
                                  KATHY
                        I already heard from Bob Sugar.
                        Jerry I want to cry for what they
                        did to you at SMI.  You helped me
                        win that gold at the Olympics, we
                        have history, and... oh Jerry...
                        if we weren't in the middle of the

                        you!
                               (starts to break down)
                        Oh Jerry, oh God...
 
              There is a click on the line.  She is pained and outraged.
 
                                  KATHY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  Call Waiting... who could be
                        calling me now?...
 
              She clicks the phone once. Her voice is suddenly cheery.
 
                                  KATHY

              She instantly starts "crying" again.
 
                                  KATHY

              Jerry on the phone.  It's getting harder to crank it up.

              INT. TIDWELL KITCHEN/HOUSE -- DAY
 
              ROD TIDWELL, 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen.  He
              is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new
              cellular phone. He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as
              he talks.  In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee
              Tidwell.
 
                                  ROD TIDWELL
                        "How am I doing?"  I'll tell you.
                        I'm sweatin, dude!  That's how I'm
                        "doin." I'm sweatin my contract.
                        I'm sweatin' Bob Sugar calling and
                        telling me I'm blowing the big
                        endorsements if I stay with you.
                        I'm sweatin'. You hear what I'm
                        saying?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I hear what you're saying...
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No.  I hear that you hear what I'm
                        saying.  But do you hear what I'm
                        saying?
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
 
              Sugar works off a wristwatch.  He spends no longer than three
              minutes on each call.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I'll bet he hasn't even called you
                        yet, right Jennifer? Wait, I need
                        to cough...
 
              He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular
              with another call on it.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        Hi, Ben, it's Sugar, hold on a
                        second, have you heard from
                        Maguire? You haven't????  Well,
                        that tells you a lot.  Hold on,
                        gotta cough...
 
              Back to the other call.


                                                                     34.

              Jerry is still on the same Tidwell call.  Looking at his
              watch.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Alright, we're just getting
                        started on my list of things you
                        need to know. Take notes if you
                        want to.

              INT. TIDWELL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell walks down the hallway, past clippings and citations
              from his career. Marcee follows, always listening.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable
                        commodity.  I go across the
                        middle. I see the ball and a dude
                        coming right at me, wanting to
                        kill me, I tell my brain "get
                        killed, catch the ball." That's
                        New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And
                        yet, nobody's giving me LOVE.
                        Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody.
                        I went to Arizona State, I'm from
                        Arizona, I break Arizona records,

                                  TIDWELL
                        Exactly.  And I'm sitting here
                        with an ant problem, look!  And my
                        brother Tee Pee's room is flooded
                        with water.  Say hello to Jerry
                        Maguire --
 
              We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of
              Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in
              Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version
              of his brother.  He says into the phone:
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        Hello Jerry Maguire.


                                                                     35.
 
 
              Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the
              house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family
              monitoring the important call.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        --  the house is fallin' apart, we
                        don't even know where we're gonna
                        live in a year, and I'm supposed
                        to be a "superstar," man!  Are you
                        catching my flow, here?
 
              Jerry looks at his watch.  Doomed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I need a decision from you, Rod.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Sugar has three phones going.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Killer, Steve, good decision.
                               (next call)
                        So it's yes, right?  Excellente.
                               (next call)
                        Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES!
 
              Tidwell enters bedroom.  Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow.
 
                                  TIDWELL

                                  TIDWELL
                        It's a very personal, very
                        important thing.  It's a family
                        motto.  So I want to share it with
                        you.  You ready?

                        Yes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Here it is.  "Show me the money."

                                  JERRY
                        I got it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Now doesn't that just make you
                        feel good to say it?  Say it with
                        me.
 
              The lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a
              chance to turn his own light on.  He sits in the oncoming
              darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone
              bank on the desk.
 
                                  JERRY

                        agent.
 
              Tidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters
              his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe
              collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head.

                        with a little ball, working for
                        white owners and white agents.
                        It's the iconography of rascism...
                               (off Tidwell's
                                dismissive look)
                        ... but I woulda stayed at the
                        bigger company.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself
              on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.
              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks
              back and symbolically flips the light switch off.
              Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off.
              So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly
              turned the lights on.
 
              EXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Bam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He
              is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
              Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.


                                                                     37.

                        Well, don't worry!  I'm not going
                        to do what you think I'm going to
                        do, which is FLIP OUT!

                               (continuing)
 
              Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
              a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
              face..

                               (continuing)
                        But let me just say, as I ease out
                        of the office I helped build --
                        sorry, but it's a fact --
 
              ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
 
              from her cubicle.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- that there is such a thing as
                        manners.  A way of treating
                        people...
 
              He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        These fish have manners!  They
                        have manners.
 
              And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
              Another cup of water as he finds power.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        In fact.  They're coming with me!
                        I'm starting a new company, and
                        the fish will come with me and...
                        you can call me sentimental.
 
              He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
              that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; to fish)
                        it's okay... it's okay...
 
              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.


                                                                     38.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But if anybody else wants to come
                        with me, this moment will be the
                        ground floor of something real and
                        fun and inspiring and true in this
                        godforsaken business and we will
                        do it together!  Who's coming with
                        me besides... "Flipper" here?
 
              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Anybody going with me?
 
              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
              second.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Wendy?  Shall we?
 
              Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.  Painfully polite:
 
                                  WENDY
                        I'm three months away from the pay
                        increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh...
                        you know, stay.
 
              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the
              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, anybody else?
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd
              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,
              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
              onto herself in the process.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'll go with you.
                               (quietly, on her
                                coffee mess)
                        Wonderful...


                                                                     39.
 
 
              She dabs at her pants.  Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              halfway across the office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 
              She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        We will see you all again.  Sleep
                        tight!
 
              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
 
              WIDE-SHOT
 
              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the
              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the
              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to Dorothy)
                        Let's see how they do without us.
 
              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
              carcass of an immense beast.
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
 
              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wonder what he said.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My favorite aunt is hearing
                        impaired. He said "you complete
                        me."


                                                                     40.
 
 
              They continue on in silence.
 
              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud
              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building
              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze
              through with boxes and fish.
 
              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So I know this is a bad time,
                        but -- you will have a medical
                        program, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
 
              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him
              briefly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And I guess we didn't talk about
                        money.  So, I'll just dive in --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Give me your number.  I'll call
                        tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm
                        a little insane right now.
                               (off her look)
                        But it's going to be great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no, I know --
 
              They arrive at her red Camry.  She writes her number on the
              back of a business card.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I mean really... wonderfully...
                               (out of steam)
                        great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsure)
                        Absolutely.
 
              She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when you think about what
                        you've done later, don't panic.


                                                                     41.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good
                        bet.
 
              She starts the engine.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        That took guts.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
              She salutes him as she drives off.  His own move, played back
              to him.  Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
              the parking lot.  Salutes her in return.  Herb Alpert.  "The
              Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
              seems puny.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
              in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's
              voices.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced
              Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks
              shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks.
              She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in
              this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses)
 
                                  JAN
                        I love men.  I respect men.  But
                        that doesn't change the fact that
                        most of them belong in cages...
 
              The other nine women nod with deep understanding.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her
              nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no-
              frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of
              her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid-
              argument.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        What about medical?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Of course, medical!


                                                                     42.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (unconvinced)
                        You are a single mother.  You have
                        given up the right to be frivolous.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (irritated)
                        If you'd read what he wrote, you
                        would have left with him too.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (more irritated)
                        You know how much those Well Child
                        exams cost --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (overlapping)
                        Of course I know --
 
                                  LAUREL/DOROTHY
                        A hundred and fifty dollars.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        And that's just when he's well --
 
              They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then:
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait. Where is he?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        He's in the living room asleep.
 
              Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wonderful.  Next time you lecture
                        me, don't leave my little boy in
                        a room with your Divorced Women's
                        Group...
 
              She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the
              garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she
              says it so nobody can hear:
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Sorry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's
              Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In
              frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the
              group.


                                                                     43.
 
 
                                  ALICE
                        Okay I've finally, finally, gotten
                        my anger straight here.  I'm going
                        to visualize Carl being here and
                        finally tell him --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhhh!
 
              Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 
              INT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT
 
              She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The
              enormity of the day arrives with a thud.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        What did I do?
 
              INT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on.
              They are both in a manic state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The power move is to go
                        unannounced.
                               (sotto)
                        Black suit, right?
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotto)
                        And the egyptian cotton shirt that
                        works with or without the jacket.
                               (full volume)
                        Tell me again, how was it left
                        with Cush?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (perfect imitation)
                        "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Ugh!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (turns, with clothes)
                        Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.
                               (sotto)
                        Jacket on, tie in pocket.


                                                                     44.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotta)
                        Good.
                               (full volume)
                        They're all heatseekers!  All of
                        them, everybody. You keep one
                        superstar and they'll all follow.
                        There's no real loyalty, and the
                        first person who told me that,
                        Jerry Maguire, was you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think I was trying to sleep with
                        you at the time.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Well, it worked, and I will not
                        let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma-
                        fuckin-guire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's right.
 
                                  AVERY
                        King of the Housecalls! Master of
                        the Living Room!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, this is working.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You are not a loser.
 
              Jerry stops, turns.  The way she says "loser" is the most
              elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
              hot dog.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Who said anything about "loser?"
                        Where do you get this word "loser?"
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I
                        meant something else.  When do you
                        want to leave?
 
              Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut.  He is packed and ready.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Let's go.  I'll drive you.


                                                                     45.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (stops, an odd
                                thought)
                        What if I don't get him?
 
              Avery takes his bag, heads for the door.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Function function function.
                        Forward motion is everything.
                        Cush saves all.
 
              Jerry takes a breath, exits.  Music.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up.  Music continues.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR -- MORNING
 
              Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever.
 
              Music continues.
 
              EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry exits car.  Adjusts the jacket.  Takes the tie off too,
              returns to the car and tosses it inside.  He walks to the
              front door with purpose.  Suddenly an intercom crackles,
              jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
 
              Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
              the upper-corner of this rustic home.  The door buzzes.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
 
              Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush
              memorabilia.  Righteous indignation building.
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        I'm in the back den, Jerry.
 
              He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
              at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
              A large draped American flag above the bar.  He is a J. Crew
              cowboy.
 
                                  MATT
                        You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
                        Beer and tomato juice --


                                                                     46.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No thanks.
 
              Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Matt, I came here because in all
                        honesty your son is just another
                        piece of cattle to SMI.  But to
                        me --
 
                                  MATT
                               (overlapping)
                        We decided to stay with you.
 
              On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman.  The move surprises
              them both.  And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few
              surprising tears of relief.  He has been spared.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, thank you.
 
                                  MATT
                        Told myself -- if he shows up,
                        we'll stick with him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know, I'm not a hugger and
                        yet... I can't let go.
 
              Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen.  Little
              brother KEITH, 14, enters with him.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
 
              INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
 
              Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-
              wheel table" where decisions are made in this house.  Jerry
              is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again.
 
                                  MATT
                        I want him to go number one in the
                        draft, and I want him to play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's either going to be Denver or
                        San Diego trading up to take him.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (big grin)
                        Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
                        don't care.


                                                                     47.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        Denver is where he should be.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll give it everything.
 
                                  MATT
                        You know I don't do "contracts."
                        But'cha do have my word, and it's
                        stronger than oak.
 
              Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer.  A good day.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
 
              Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's
              the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he
              knows the words, but...
 
                                  JERRY
                               (sings)
                        Feelin...
 
              He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
              channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will
              ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds
              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
              He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches
              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
              response of the song, like a happy idiot.
 
              INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery
                        there? Where can I reach her?
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about
              the new arrangement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta,
                        didn't leave me her hotel number.


                                                                     48.
 
 
              Through the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red
              hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through
              life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces
              of wood and a hammer.
 
                                  CHAD
                        The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 
                                  RAY
                               (jumping)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey -- later, okay?
                               (Ray jumps on her)
                        Whoop.  Wait.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (back to phone)
                        Sorry, that's my son and the
                        nanny. I had the calls transferred
                        to my home so I could go over your
                        stuff.
 
              Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He
              sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, that's fine.  What calls came
                        in today?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait.  That's yesterday, from the
                        other office. Today is...
 
              She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to
              today, which is blank.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        ... light.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shit, it's just so frustrating to
                        not be able to talk to Avery --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Wait a minute, it has to be one of
                        the NFL hotels we do business
                        with -- let me look -- but in the
                        meantime, about this job --


                                                                     49.
 
 
              She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through
              a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood
              news:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (importantly)
                        Dorothy, let me tell you
                        something, we are back. We are so
                        very very back.  I re-signed Cush.
                        We're set.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We are?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's all going to work.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I just got goosebumps.
 
              She examines her own skin with surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (manic, quiet)
                        It's all going to work.  We're
                        going to save the world.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well, I'm happy for you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Happy for us.
 
              Oddly, the phrase affects her physically.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Happy for us... okay.  Here's the
                        number. 404-453-2222.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Call me later, hon.
 
              She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them
              stare at her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 
                                  CHAD
                               (laughing)
                        Yeah, Dotty. You did.


                                                                     50.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Twenty six years old.  I'm already
                        saying "hon". Hug your mother
                        quickly --
 
              Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy.
              Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
              INT. ATLANTA HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
 
              Avery in mid-conference with four other NFL men in background.
 
                                  AVERY
                        YA-HOOOO-SIE!
 
              It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls
              back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed.
              In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers.
              Part of them lusts after her.  The larger part knows she
              would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know.  Sorry I threw a scare
                        into our lives there --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't worry about it -- I never
                        told you what I thought of that
                        memo either --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, no you didn't --
 
                                  AVERY
                        You lost your head, it happens.
                               (quickly)
                        I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen.
                        I'm going to have to fly to
                        Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we
                        meet in the Dallas airport and we
                        all fly into New York together for
                        the draft?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a plan --  --


                                                                     51.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'll set it up with your girl.
                        Woo!  This is when it's good,
                        Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love
                        it.  And when I see you, I'm going
                        to give you the best blow job of
                        your life.
 
              He hangs up, staring at the phone. In the room with Avery,
              the co-workers look at each other. She is far, far out of
              their league.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S CAR -- LATER MORNING -- DRIVING
 
              Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity
              fills the car. On the radio, a sports station debates the
              future of Cushman. as Jerry whips through a stack of sports
              pages.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Avery'll meet you at the B gate at
                        4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will
                        already be there.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (nods to Ray)
                        Hey, man, you know they have big
                        balloons built into cars?
 
                                  RAY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        They do, my brother.
 
                                  RAY
                               (giggling)
                        I'm not your brother!
 
              Dorothy continues, business on her mind.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... I put Tidwell on the same
                        floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I
                        think it's great you're taking him
                        to the draft. He doesn't smoke,
                        right? I have no idea.


                                                                     52.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have no idea.
                               (continuing to Ray)
                        So Ray, if there's an accident or
                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --
                               (simulates air-bag)
                        -- and you go booooong.  And
                        you're safe.
 
              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is
              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her
              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers
              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,
              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
              this guy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, have we gone over
                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,
                        Ray.  Wish me luck.
 
                           DOROTHY                       RAY
                   Luck.                         LUCK!
 
              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the
              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,
              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small
              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on
              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the
              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,
              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of
              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and
              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,
              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.
              ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?"  "You gonna
              be rich, dude!") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he
              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid
              approaches Tidwell.
 
                                  KID
                        Are you Hootie?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        No man, I'm not Hootie.
 
              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone
              know his stardom, his essence, his power?


                                                                     53.
 
 
                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
                        All those disabled, and Frank
                        Cushman can board now...
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY
 
              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes
              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits
              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at
              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (a big thought)
                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes
                        reward the evil and punish the
                        good?
 
              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Let me think about that.  Want
                        something to drink?
 
                                  CUSH
                               (thoughtful pause)
                        I see what you're saying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  What do you mean?
 
              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell
              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey man, I wish I had a
                        quarterback like you in Arizona.
                        You're the shit.
 
              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Thank ya.
 
              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't
              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (loud mumble)
                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin
                        good.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Say what?


                                                                     54.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus
                        Christ was still in heaven.  And
                        you ain't even played in the NFL.
 
              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell
              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.
 
                                  JERRY
                        This can't be happening to me.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry!  Do something --
 
              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.
 
                                  JERRY
                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,
                        five years old?  Am I taking the
                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow
                        up, both of you!  We are a family.
                        And we go to the draft in an
                        ORDERLY FASHION.
 
              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too
              much.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Me too, dude.  Especially that big
                        old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's
                        just insanity, man.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Heard that.
 
              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.
              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles
              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She
              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites
              her.
 
              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
 
              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.


                                                                     55.
 
 
              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.
 
              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
 
              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        At last I find you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (sharply)
                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel
                        like I'm five years late for the
                        Prom.
 
              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on
              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's
              ego.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're
                        going to take a walk through this
                        lobby. I want every media guy,
                        every player rep, everybody to see
                        you for what you are.  The best-
                        kept secret in the NFL. The
                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.
                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever
                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em
                        see how big you are.  You ready?
                        Let's do it.
 
              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (begrudgingly)
                        A'right.  Let's walk.
 
              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus"
              from Live at Leeds.


                                                                     56.
 
 
              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past
              the reporters, the competing agents, the team
              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a
              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones
              everywhere, in every hand.
 
              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,
              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and
              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does
              not sit down.  Music continues.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY
 
              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire
              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry
                        Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the
                        draft...
 
              INT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT
 
              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone
              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All
              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming
              draft selections.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I
                        can buy a decent quarterback.
                        Who's he talking to?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        They don't look interested do they?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Actually...
 
              Wilburn looks concerned.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the
              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve
              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.


                                                                     57.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I came all the way here for that?
                        To walk the lobby?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  And it might have even
                        worked too.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Let's do it again.
 
              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a
              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is
              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell
              continues talking.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        You believe they're shooting a
                        Nike ad down there?  Did I ever
                        tell you my Nike story?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I gotta get back to Cushman.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it
                        down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they
                        do is ignore me...
 
              Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know what was great about you
                        down there?  For about five
                        minutes, you unloaded that rather
                        expansive, let me just say "large"
                        chip that resides right there on
                        your shoulder, and you know what?
                        You were brilliant.  Take care.
 
              Jerry starts to exit.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (mock serious)
                        I'm not about love -- I'm about
                        "showing you the money."
 
              Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.


                                                                     58.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good.  I was just testing ya.
                               (beat)
                        But just you saying that? Makes me
                        love ya.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Sure you don't want to go out and
                        find some karoake?  I'm a very
                        good singer, man --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Call me tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I might call you later!
 
              Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A
              small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs.
 
              INT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.
              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,
              sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food
              abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend
              ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the
              man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,
              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues
              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's
              "Something In The Way."  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (to hotel waiter)
                        Hey, what size are you?
 
                                  WAITER
                        Eleven.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (grandly)
                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs
                        of them new Nikes by the door --
 
              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.
 
                                  WAITER
                        Dude, you're like a God.


                                                                     59.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                               (immediately)
                        God, you're like a dude.
 
              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma,
              the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues
              strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
                        to make.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
                        they Don't have any feelings...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay. San Diego just came in with
                        a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Something in the way.  Yeah."
 
                                  MATT
                        Well, he's gotta go number one.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Ooooooo."
 
                                  JERRY
                        He still goes number one, but San
                        Diego wants to trade up with New
                        England -- they want him bad.
 
              Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
              the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
 
                                  MATT
                        What happened to Denver?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Denver got very silent about a day
                        ago.  San Diego's got a fever for
                        Cush.  This stuff tends to happen
                        the night before a draft.  People
                        get crazy.  And San Diego, you
                        should know, is crazy to the tune
                        of seven years for thirty. Signing
                        bonus of eight.
                               (beat)
                        Million.
 
              Anne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed,
              and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is
              ringing.


                                                                     60.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        I don't know, Jerry.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Should I unplug the phone?
 
                                  CUSH
                        Reporters, Jerry.  They been
                        callin' all night.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Just be friendly and say "no
                        comment."
 
                                  CUSH
                        Talking and saying nothing, man,
                        it's an art I have not mastered.
 
              Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the
              ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "This is Cush."
 
              Suddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens.
 
              INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        It's Sugar.  He must be there,
                        right? Just sniff or something if
                        he's there.
                               (Jerry sniffs,
                                panicked)
                        Alright, buddydude.  Just
                        remember. You're swimming with the
                        big boys now. You let your dad do
                        all the talking.  I'm the one who
                        got you the deal you needed.  This
                        is business not friendship. Be
                        strong.  You're global now.
 
              Sugar hangs up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "No comment.
 
              Jerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is
              spinning.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
                        again!


                                                                     61.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
                        got "Cushlash."
 
              More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
              speaks casually, directly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, before I go back to Denver.
                        I think we should put something
                        down on paper.  Something that
                        says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
                        Maguire."
 
              He pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few
              lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
 
                                  MATT
                        Not right now, Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do I know everything there is to
                        know here?
                               (silent beat)
                        You fellas aren't talking with Bob
                        Sugar, are you?
 
              More silence.
 
                                  MATT
                        Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
                        with him instead of you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quickly)
                        Said who?  Sugar?
 
                                  MATT
                        Hey, I'm learning as I go.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
                        with Denver behind my back?
 
                                  MATT
                        I'm sorry, I --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I brought Denver to twenty
                        million. Denver deals with me all
                        the time. You listened to Sugar?
                        You let that snake in the door.
 
              Jerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself.


                                                                     62.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll
                        fix this up.  You didn't sign
                        anything with Sugar, right?
 
              Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (blurts)
                        Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
                        a famous athlete and I'm gonna
                        sign with you'.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shut up!
                               (beat)
                        I'm sorry... sorry.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (sympathy for Jerry)
                        S' cool.
 
              Shot moves in on Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually
                        sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
                        you didn't sign.
                               (beat)
                        Because I'm still sort of moved by
                        your "my word is stronger'n oak"
                        thing --
 
                                  MATT
                        We signed an hour ago.  You were
                        in the lobby with the black fella.
 
              Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
              things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
 
                                  CUSH
                        I'm sorry, Jerry.
 
                                  MATT
                        They say it's show "business,"
                        Jerry, not show friends.
 
              Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
              settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
              all it's neon logo glory.


                                                                     63.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well. Okay. Of course. You're
                        twenty years old, and I'm just
                        another guy in a suit.  It's all
                        business. It didn't work out.  You
                        didn't buy my product, which is,
                        unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
                        there's a speech that I'm supposed
                        to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
                        there cheering for you." "The door
                        is always open!"  See? I'm a class
                        act.
                               (breath, directly)
                        But maybe this would have all
                        worked, us being real human
                        beings, coming through for each
                        other, really, and now I'll never
                        know. You'll never know. Weren't
                        you curious?
                               (they aren't)
                        No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine.
                        And you'll be fine.  And Keith I
                        bope you do call me.
 
              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the
              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
              guitar.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby
              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.
 
                                  PATRICIA LOGAN
                        Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
                        had three concussions?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm sorry... excuse me...
 
              INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.


                                                                     64.
 
 
              INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I just heard.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do I do?  How do I spin this?
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh honey.  It's spun.
 
              She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What did I do to you?
 
              She is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know?
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's all about you, isn't it?
                        Soothe me, save me, love me --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Could you just stop moving?
 
                                  AVERY
                        I have to finish my job --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Everything's on the fucking run!
                        Everything --
 
              She stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  You and I are salespeople.
                        We sell --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, I don't want a --
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's not "love me."  It's not
                        "trust my handshake."  It's make
                        the sale. Get it signed.  There
                        shouldn't be "confusion" about
                        that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Go ahead.  Jump right on into my
                        nightmare.  The water's warm.


                                                                     65.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        So honesty is outlawed here, I
                        can't be honest?
 
              She turns and exits again.  He follows.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell you what -- I'd prefer
                        loyalty..
 
                                  AVERY
                        What was our deal when we first
                        got together?  Brutal truth,
                        remember?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you added the "brutal."
 
              She stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a
              troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
                        thing that some people have.  I
                        don't have it.  I don't cry at
                        movies.  I don't gush over babies.
                        I don't start celebrating
                        Christmas five months early, and
                        I don't tell a man who just
                        screwed up both of our lives --
                        'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For
                        better or worse.  But I do love
                        you.
 
              Jerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery
              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
              different to him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery --
 
              She knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't say it.  We're both ragged
                        out right now.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- stop --
 
              She exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she
              stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly
              interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
              45.


                                                                     66.
 
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                        Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the
                        Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you
                        two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
                        Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
                        Hello!
 
              Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis
              gets a whiff of what he walked into.
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                               (continuing; exiting
                                quickly)
                        Goodbye!
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm warning you.  Don't say it.
                        You won't have another chance.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me!
 
                                  AVERY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's over --
 
              She continues moving into the next room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Didn't hear it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        There is something missing here.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You've never been alone and you
                        can't be alone --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me, it's over.
 
              She can barely believe it.  She blinks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        No one has ever dumped me.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not trying to make history.


                                                                     67.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I did the 23 hour nose-route to
                        the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
                        I can make this work.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        No.
 
              She takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small
              voice of her vulnerability.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (steps closer)
                        You know I didn't ever want to
                        hurt you.
 
              She gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away,
              then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with
              the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
              hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He
              sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him,
              addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
                        I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
 
              INT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING
 
              Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
              Both wear sunglasses.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You love me now, don't you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Very much.
 
              ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
 
              is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
              athlete.
 
              INT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY
 
              Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight.
              Jerry nurses a stiff drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Everybody on this show cries now.


                                                                     68.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (off t.v. )
                        You feel bad you tested positive?
                        Quit doing blow!  You feel bad
                        about your baby girl? Why did you
                        leave the mother?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What are you doing with me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Huh?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't you even see -- I'm
                        finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
                        hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
                        a cautionary tale!
 
              Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        See this jacket I'm wearing?  You
                        like it?  I don't really need it,
                        because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
                        I lost the number one draft pick
                        the night before the draft. They
                        will teach my story to other
                        agents on "do not do this" day in
                        agent school. Why? Let's recap.
                        Because a hockey player's kid made
                        me feel like a superficial jerk,
                        I had two slices of bad pizza,
                        went to bed, grew a conscience and
                        wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The least you could do is nod and
                        act sympathetic --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a quality that might come in
                        handy for a commercial sometime.


                                                                     69.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You are not allowed to act this
                        way.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why not?
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY
 
              They sit together. Jerry holds another drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Man, I got a shelf life of ten
                        years, tops!  My next contract's
                        gotta bring me the dollars that'11
                        last me and mine a very long time.
                        I'm out of this sport in five
                        years.  What's my family gonna
                        live on? What you get me.  So I
                        don't want to hear about ya shit,
                        your "nya nya nya."
 
                                  JERRY
                               (ruefully, to
                                attendant)
                        Another drink please.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Anybody else would have left you
                        by now, but I'm sticking with you.
                        I said I would. And if I got to
                        ride your ass like Zorro, you're
                        gonna show me the money.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (the hell that never
                                ends)
                        Oh my God.
 
              He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only
              room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
              sits in it.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's coming over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        At eleven at night?


                                                                     70.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He just lost his best client.  He
                        called from the plane.  I invited
                        the guy over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
                        is a "syndrome."  It's called
                        Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
                        Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-
                        God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
                        Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-
                        Assistant-Without Medical-For-
                        Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing
                        all that, you still allow him to
                        come over, more power to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey, he's engaged.  And for the
                        first time in my professional
                        life, I'm a part of something I
                        believe in.
 
              Dorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Okay, but he better not be good
                        looking!
 
              INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy puts Ray to bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        'Night buddy.  This is my favorite
                        part of your head.
 
              She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the
              mirror.
 
              She checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall
              above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
              later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, turn here!  Sharp right
                        turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 
              The cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both
              sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.


                                                                     71.
 
 
              Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same
              with the oncoming car.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
              hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (super pleasant)
                        You seem just the way I pictured
                        you. I'm her disapproving sister
                        Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Honesty.  Thank you.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi.
 
              The lights are low and his glasses are very dark.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Thanks for inviting me over.
                        Where's the little guy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep.  Watch out for that
                        lamp.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
 
              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.


                                                                     72.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with
                        Avery.
 
              Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
              quite understand.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Too bad.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Better now than later.  We'll
                        still be friends. I'm dying here.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        And just think if I got her the
                        ring she really wanted.
 
              Dorothy laughs.  He looks at her strangely.  Suddenly she
              feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a
                        seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
                        for that cut too.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do you have something to drink?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure --
 
              She moves to the kitchen door.  She is about to exit, when
              Jerry begins to unburden.
 
                                  JERRY
                        My brother works for the White
                        House. He pretends he's an
                        intellectual.  He pretends he's
                        from the east coast.
 
              She turns, not quite sure what his point is.  She waits
              politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I was supposed to be the
                        successful one.
                                  (more)


                                                                     73.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        But I don't want to talk about it.
                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a
                        religion --you don't bitch.  No
                        moaning!  Head down.  Do it,
                        whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
 
              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
              taking.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Beer okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, thanks.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
              Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        I heard.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No kidding.  I looked over and saw
                        the shadow of two curious shoes in
                        the doorway of the kitchen.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        This guy would go home with a
                        gardening tool right now if it
                        showed interest.
                               (off Dorothy's look)
                        Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Look, here's some of that chicken
                        with salsa too, I warmed it up --


                                                                     74.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That's the girl I love.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        But you just gotta hear me out on
                        one thing.  You're very
                        responsible with Ray and you know
                        it's not right for a little boy to
                        hear some strange man's voice in
                        the house.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        As opposed to twenty angry women?
 
              Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
              collide in the small kitchen.  Dorothy deftly catches the
              food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate.  But
              her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
              Laurel takes command.  They know each other well.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, let's get you another
                        top --
 
              They exit to nearby laundry room.
 
              EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
              showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
              room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room
              and stare at Jerry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
              up to see Ray.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi Ray.
 
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
 
                                  LAUREL
                        All I'm saying.  You don't have
                        the luxury of falling for some
                        drowning man.  Be practical.  Now.
                        Which top?
 
              She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down
              front. The other is striped, cute, functional.


                                                                     75.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, you want to talk about
                        practical? Let's talk about my
                        wonderful life. Do you know what
                        most other women my age are doing
                        right now? They are partying in
                        clubs, trying to act stupid,
                        trying to get a man, trying to
                        keep a man... not me. I'm trying
                        to RAISE a man.
 
              She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
                        of Roger, for the rest of my life.
                        I have had three lovers in four
                        years, all boring, all achingly
                        self-sufficient all friends of
                        yours I might add, and all of them
                        running a distant second to a warm
                        bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at
                        me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in
                        the world!  How do I look?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
              piece of rope.
 
                                  RAY
                        And then my dad died and my mom
                        took me to the zoo and I love the
                        zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
                        love the zoo?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  I want to tell you more
                        about my dad.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  I've been hogging it.
                        You're right.
                                  (more)


                                                                     76.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        All my life I've been trying to
                        talk, really talk, and no one
                        wants to listen.  You know that
                        feeling?
 
              Ray nods vigorously.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go right now.  Let's go to
                        the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
                        the zoo is closed.
 
                                  RAY
                        You said "fuck".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah I know.  I did.
 
              Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee.
 
                                  RAY
                        I won't tell.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll go to the zoo sometime.
                        Okay? I think I might have some
                        time on my hands.
 
              Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
 
                                  RAY
                        I don't see any.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (points respectfully)
                        Funny.
 
                                  RAY
                        Funny...
                               (imitates him)
                               (hears mom
                                approaching)
                        I better go to bed.
 
              Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid
              for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
              appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
              attitude, and a tray.


                                                                     77.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you
                        a cab.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (slightly confused)
                        Good idea.  Thank you.
 
              And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little
              boy asleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Right.  Of course.
 
              Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
              not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it,
              inelegantly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So.  Our company.
 
              She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
              little. Then stands.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 
              He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your.
                        Job.
                               (beat)
                        Our company is in good shape. You
                        and your son... we... are just
                        fine.  You still have a job. I
                        want you to feel confident!  In.
                        Me.  And I have a problem with
                        people who talk about themselves
                        in the third person, but let me
                        tell you something about Jerry
                        Maguire.
 
              His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
              poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Come after me and you will lose I
                        am a survivor!  Do not
                        underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've
                        got wits!
                                  (more)


                                                                     78.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        I've got the instincts of a
                        panther!
                               (joust)
                        I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about me.  I can get
                        jobs --
 
                                  JERRY
                        We will be fine!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- especially one like this.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I am...
 
              He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
              stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I am drunk.
 
              He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head.
              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the
              personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
              tip of the aloe vera plant.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Truth?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure.
 
              Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
              visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She
              gets closer.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure, I care about the job.  Of
                        course.  But mostly...
                               (very honest)
                        ...  I want to be inspired.
 
              There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
              "inspiring."
 
                                  JERRY
                        Me too.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What you wrote inspired me.


                                                                     79.
 
 
              He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A
              woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm working with you because of
                        that memo...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Mission... statement...
 
              They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool
              hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The
              taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on
              her breast.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sorry about this hand.
                               (he rises unsteadily)
                        You know that feeling -- you're
                        not completely embarrassed yet,
                        but you glimpe tomorrow's
                        embarrassment?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about it, boss.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh shit.  You said "boss."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah, I did.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  No don't feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I do.  I feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
                               (the worst day ever)
                        I'm like... harrassing you...
                        right now.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I may not sue.
 
              He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry
              rubs his face.  And then:


                                                                     80.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, good evening.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good evening.
 
              He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll be okay.  And I'm going to
                        take my... one client and we're
                        gonna go all the way.
 
              He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
              little.  He is a mess, and he knows it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; loving
                                the dark humor)
                        Hey. I'm back.
 
              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking
              back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
              He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
              He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM
              we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
              look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We gotta talk about his contract,
                        Dennis.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Your timing is impeccable,
                        Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
                        you ever lost Cush...


                                                                     81.
 
 
              Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
 
              Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear
              a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
              signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I started talking with Dennis
                        Wilburn about your renegotation.
 
              Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Did you tell him about the "ten
                        million for four years?"
 
                                  JERRY
                        Uh, not today, but --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre
                        Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools,
                        and yet they're making the big
                        sweet dollars. They're making the
                        money, and I got an agent that
                        ain't even put the number on the
                        table.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I understand your anxiety.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Maybe you don't.  Because it's not
                        just the money I deserve.  It's
                        not just the "coin."  It's the...
 
              He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        --  the kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's your word?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
                        community... and the dollars too.
                        The package.  The kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (impressed)
                        But how did you get "kwan?"


                                                                     82.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        I got there from "coin," dude.
                        Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Great word.  Towel?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, I air-dry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I say this with great
                        respect, but those players you
                        mentioned are marquee players
                        and --
 
              A portable phone beeps.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Is that your porty or mine?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You.
 
              Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and
              answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
                        in the new agent.  He says I'm not
                        marquee.  I know... I know...
 
              Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
              Marcee going off.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        My wife is upset with you.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
 
              The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
              mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on,
              gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
              be listening.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Here's what I'm saying.  This is
                        a renegotiation.  We want more
                        from them, so let's show them more
                        from us. Let's show them your pure
                        joy of the game, let's bury the
                        Attitude a little, let's show
                        them --


                                                                     83.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        You're telling me to dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm saying to be --
 
              He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (little voice)
                        "Love me love me love me... put me
                        on t.v."
                               (pissed)
                        That's the iconography of rascism,
                        man!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm
                        telling you to be the best version
                        of you, to get back to the guy who
                        first started playing this game.
                        Way back when you were a kid.  It
                        wasn't just about the money, was
                        it?
 
              Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Do your job, man, don't tell me to
                        dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
              He begins gathering his things.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm an athlete, not an
                        entertainer. These are the ABC's
                        of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 
              Jerry rubs face.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        What's wrong.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Forget it.  Forget it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No tell me.


                                                                     84.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm out here for you!  You don't
                        know what it's like to be me out
                        here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
                        pride-swallowing seige that I will
                        never fully tell you about! Okay?!
                        Help me help you help me help you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're hanging by a very thin
                        thread, dude.  And I dig that
                        about you.
 
              Jerry has had enough for one day.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (loopy, punch-drunk,
                                arms flailing)
                        Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you!
                        I'll see you in L.A.!
 
              Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        See, man, that's the difference.
                        between us.  You think we're
                        fighting, I think we're finally
                        talking!
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
              thought.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They
              are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
              encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his
              calls.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
                        to say he's faxing in the new
                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
                        and you'll be happy.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (jolted into
                                happiness)
                        Happy. He said "happy?"
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Actually he said "glad."


                                                                     85.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Plus, you could use that
                        commission.
 
              She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a
              quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I sunk most of what I had into
                        this condo, which devalued, and --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        You don't have to explain.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, the other night, I want to
                        apologize.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (can't read her)
                        Yeah, what happened there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We're two people working together
                        and we can't have an atmosphere.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm relieved you said that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I mean, the other night was... I
                        felt like you understood something
                        I could barely even say, something
                        way down deep in the murk --
                               (beat)
                        -- but we have a company here to
                        think about.  I won't ever take
                        advantage of you in that way again.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Oh good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You walked out on a job for me,
                        and I won't ruin that.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Exactly because I know this is a
                        time when you need to be alone
                        with your thoughts.
                                  (more)


                                                                     86.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Think about everything that's gone
                        wrong, how to fix them, and just
                        be... alone, alone, alone.
 
              Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want to go out to dinner?
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her
              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
 
                                  JAN
                        I broke up with the Cowboy. And
                        now he's stalking me...
 
                                  ALICE
                        What's the current definition of
                        stalking?
 
                                  WOMAN # 1
                        Coming over uninvited.
 
                                  JAN
                               (thoughtful)
                        So Romeo under the trellis... was
                        a stalker.
 
              Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as
              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,
              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
              wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging
              Jerry.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.


                                                                     87.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (outdressed)
                        Wow.  That's more than a dress.
                        That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
                        the idea of an evening among
                        adults -- no offense buster.
                               (then)
                        You meet Chad the nanny?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
                        I guess I didn't realize we were...
 
              He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The
              cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new
              sensation for this bachelor.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't let him stay up too late.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (grandly)
                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
                        teach Ray about jazz.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good, that'll put him to sleep
                        early. No offense.
 
              She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
 
                                  CHAD
                        You know, you people have a jazz
                        problem in this house.
 
              Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
 
                                  RAY
                        I wanna go too.
 
              Laurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
              room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bye you guys.


                                                                     88.
 
 
              Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down
              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
              one.
 
              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
 
              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on
              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
              the lawn. "All Shook Down."  Replacements.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of
              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
              them.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Hey!
 
              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
              have privacy with her sister.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (continuing)
                        Forgot your keys --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (privately)
                        That's the first time I ever saw
                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
                        that just... thrilling?
                               (eyes tear up)
                        I mean, he must have been needing
                        that.
 
              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        No no.  Don't cry at the beginning
                        of the date.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (laughing, wiping
                                tear)
                        Oh, knock it off!


                                                                     89.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (can't help it)
                        And don't be a shoulder for him to
                        cry on either.
 
              We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music
              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
              street.
 
              INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican
              restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It was laziness1 my whole breakup
                        with Avery. You know that thing
                        you say, "it's nobody's fault."
                        It's one of the great lies, right?
                        Someone is always to blame -- if
                        you go for it, go for it like you
                        do a job, work at it --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Maybe love shouldn't be such hard
                        work. I know, but --
 
              Mariachis approach the table.
 
                                  HEAD MARIACHI
                        A song for the lovers?
 
                                  JERRY/DOROTHY
                               (too quickly)
                        No.  No thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We work together.
 
              Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so,
              reluctantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        See, you choose. If you fall for
                        someone, if you make a commitment,
                        you should make it work.  It's
                        only when "options" entered the
                        picture that things got bad. I'm
                        speaking historically now.  It's
                        a modern day concept,
                        nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel?
                        -- I think the only good thing to
                                  (more)


                                                                     90.

                        come from this period in history
                        is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Maybe you should call her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no no.  I just underestimated
                        her...
                               (touches wound)
                        her temper, I guess.  Why are we
                        even talking about this?
 
              A FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses.
 
                                  FLOWER GIRL
                        A rose for the lady.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want a --

                        No.  No way.
 
              Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage
                        to Roger was so great, even
                        before --
                               (stops herself)
                        Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (simply)
                        Let's not tell our sad stories.
 
              Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be right back. Quit thinking
                        those murky thoughts, okay? We're
                        young, we're semi-successful. Life
                        is good.
 
              She exits and we hang on him for a moment.


                                                                     91.
 
 
              INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No, now... come on... let Chad
                        catch the bee in a glass.  He
                        won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
                        such a good heart. I love you,
                        I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to
                        see you.
 
              EXT. BATHROOM
 
              Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
              happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
              a mournful "Tears in Heaven."  She smiles at the image, in
              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
              in another direction.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, let's take a walk.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the
              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well -- this would be goodnight.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              They don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you tomorrow.
 
              They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
              close. Kisses him.  It's a good one.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.
              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
              she's brought back from the restaurant.


                                                                     92.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing; breath)
                        I think you should not come in, or
                        come in depending on how you feel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right.  I'll come in.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay. Wait here a second.
                               (beat, then)
                        Do we really want to do this?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (half-unsure)
                        Oh hell yes.
 
              She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when
              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now
              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
              evidence.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep, right?
 
                                  CHAD
                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Still going.
 
              Chad raises his eyebrows.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Shhh.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the
              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and
              down.
 
                                  CHAD
                        Treat her right, man.  She's...


                                                                     93.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... well...
 
                                  CHAD
                        She's great.  And I know this is
                        a little awkward, but I want you
                        to use this.
 
              Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat
              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a
              cassette tape.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (continuing; intense)
                        This... is Miles Davis and John
                        Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two
                        masters of freedom, playing in a
                        time before their art was
                        corrupted by a zillion cocktail
                        lounge performers who destroyed
                        the legacy of the only American
                        artform -- JAZZ.
 
              Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
              Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
 
              INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
 
              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
              gone.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What is this MUSIC?
 
              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter
              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
 
              Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night
              joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter
              from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers
              her sister brought back from dinner.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
              Radio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the
              digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls
              on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on
              toys.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
              possible drops of coffee.
 
                                  DOROTHY

                        Ray will never see his mother's
                        raging physical needs.
 
              She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.

              INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
 
              Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.

                        who, because of the way things are

              listening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
              honesty an agent rarely hears.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... so what am I, for taking the

                        Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am
                        I a bad person? All I know is that
                        I found someone who was charming
                        and popular and not-so-nice to
                        me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why
                        should I let this guy go, when
                        everything in my body says This

                        fun details --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
                        And oh, I don't know if you're
                        interested in this detail, but I
                        was just about to tell you that I
                        love him.  I love him, and I don't
                        care what you think.  I love him
                        for the guy he wants to be, and I
                        love him for the guy he almost is.
                        I love him.
 
              They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              rubbing his face.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi Jerry!
 
              Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
              there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway
              in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
              to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
              her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Easy, easy --
 
              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but
                        I won't, I heard everything.
                               (to Laurel)
                        Thank you for your honesty, as
                        always.


                                                                     96.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (frozen polite)
                        Coffee, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders
                        prefer cereal first --
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's have Apple Jacks!
 
              Apple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still
              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly
              complete-looking family.
 
                                  RAY
                               (continuing)
                        What's going on, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        A lot.  We got a big fax today...
                        we need this commission, buddy.
 
              The sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels
              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs
              and continues to feel happy.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
              cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That was great of you this morning.
 
              The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (friendly, dismissive)
                        Look, let's just root for a big
                        offer so we can move out of this
                        room to a real office.
 
              She feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a
              window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
 
              ON FAX
 
              Connecting.


                                                                     97.
 
 
              FOUR FACES
 
              waiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax.
              Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts
              her eyes.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Read it to me, and don't say
                        anything unless it's over nine.
 
              There is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart
              sinks.  His face slackens.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit --
 
              Rod turns away.  Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        One-point-seven for three years.
                        That's below average.  We owe more
                        than that...
 
              It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
              in a seat too small for him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll go back to them.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (explodes)
                        And say what?  "Please remove your
                        dick from my ass?!"
 
              Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant
                        right now.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I feel like crying.  I feel like
                        breaking the room up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, we don't take this
                        emotionally. We roll with this
                        problem.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What are you talking about --
                        "don't get emotional." If you ask
                        me, you haven't gotten emotional
                        ENOUGH about this man.


                                                                     98.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What DO you stand for???
 
              Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        How about a little piece of
                        integrity in this world that is so
                        filled with greed and a lack of
                        honorability that I don't know
                        what to tell my kid except take a
                        look at a guy who isn't shouting
                        "show me the money," he's quietly
                        broke and working for you for free!
                               (off Jerry's pained
                                look)
                        Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
                        at the insults as she is.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        No, that was pretty good.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (impressed)
                        No shit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        In fact, you should read something
                        that meant the world to me...
 
              She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
              is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
              swiftly intercepts it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Another time, okay Dorothy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Fine, I just --
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I appreciate that impulse.
 
              Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
              Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
              without his protective shield of attitude.  Scared.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You
                        tell me to eat lima beans, I'll
                        eat lima beans.

                                                                     99.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL (cont'd)
                        If you say take the shitty deal,
                        that's all we can get --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "All we can get?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
 
              Marcee is passionate.  Focused on Rod.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You know what you're qonna do,
                        Rodney. You're gonna reject this
                        shitty contract. You're gonna play
                        out your existihg shitty contract
                        and go be a free agent next year
                        and the hell with Arizona. This is
                        us, and we determine our worth.
                        You're a fine, proud, surviving,
                        splendid black man.
 
              Beat.  Truer words...  The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Honey, you are just --
 
              No one else in the world exists.  They are focused totally on
              each other.  Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
              watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        -- the shit.
 
              She caresses the back of his neck.  He pulls her to him.  He
              gives her a small kiss.  Dorothy and Jerry look at the
              couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable.  There is a
              palpable forcefield around the Tidwells.  They are a couple
              in every passionate sense of the word.  After a beat:
 
                                  JERRY
                        If you get injured, you get
                        nothing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Won't happen.  I'm strong in my
                        mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a risk.
 
              Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
              implications of the decision.


                                                                     100.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like
                        I bet on you.
 
              Tidwell puts his hand out.  Maguire is conflicted, but he
              takes a breath and shakes.
 
              EXT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Tidwell and Marcee exit.  Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll get you some quick work --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good deal, man.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm sorry what I said back there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't be silly.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My husband believes in you.  We're
                        gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Take care you guys.
 
              Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The
              Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Look...  I was up for a job in San
                        Diego before I left SMI. It's with
                        the Chargers.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              touching down.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't even talk about that yet.
                        I'll find something fast for
                        Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
 
              EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
 
              Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
              commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large
              Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
              director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is
              arguing with Tidwell.


                                                                     101.
 
 
              Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a
              camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bill, Rod, wait --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Dude, know your art form.  If you
                        put the camera down here, looking
                        up, I look more powerful.  There's
                        no need for a camel... you got ME.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, get on the camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                               (shoots look to Jerry)
                        The sponsor wants a camel --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry, back me up.  It's either
                        the camel or me...
 
              Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
              stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (takes the bullet)
                        Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him
                        out of this.  This isn't what I
                        had in mind anyway.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Then you shouldn't have begged me
                        to hire him.
 
              EXT. SET -- LATER
 
              Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the
              background, another athlete rides the camel.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        There you go, dude.  You're
                        learning how to represent me.  We
                        ain't gonna bring Nike to their
                        knees with some regional camel
                        ad --
 
              Jerry rubs his face.


                                                                     102.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I ask you a question totally
                        unrelated to your career?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh, we gonna be friends now?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do you know about dating a
                        single mother?
 
              Tidwell warms to the personal question.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by
                        a single mother.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell me, because it's been a
                        month, and she's about to take
                        another job in San Diego.
 
              Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        First, single mothers don't
                        "date." They have been to the
                        circus, you know what I'm saying?
                        They have been to the puppet show
                        and they have seen the strings.
                        You love her?
 
                                  JERRY
                        How do I know?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You know when you know.  It makes
                        you shivver, it eats at your
                        insides. You know?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I don't know.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then you gotta have The Talk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I sure don't like that she's
                        leaving.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, that ain't fair to her.  A
                        single mother, that's a sacred
                        thing, man.


                                                                     103.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        The kid is amazing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.  A real man does not shoplift
                        the "pooty" from a single mom.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We
                        were thrown together and -- I mean
                        it's two mutual people who --
                               (a look)
                        Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
 
              INT. ZOO -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's
              arm. Life-changing decisions in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        They offered me everything I asked
                        for, it's only 2 hours away. I
                        think it's good for us.
 
              Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray.
              They approach the reptile house.
 
                                  RAY
                        Show me the animal, Jerry!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right up ahead, buddy --
 
              They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is
              gathered.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        -- I give you my favorite animal
                        in the zoo.  Are you ready for the
                        weirdness, the strange perfection
                        and truth of...
 
                                  RAY
                        I'm scared.  What is it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's in a cage.  Do not be scared
                        of...
 
              A few people peel away, revealing...


                                                                     104.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
 
              THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two
              heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other
              for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from
              "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn
              away.
 
                                  RAY
                        Whoa.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (quietly)
                        Two heads.  My God...
 
              Jerry is happy to play tour-guide.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Both heads have brains.  Both
                        heads eat, both heads battle for
                        direction all day long.
                               (meaningful)
                        Man, can I relate.
 
              The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly.
 
                                  RAY
                        Me too.
 
              Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to
              Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Is this a guy thing?
 
                                  ANONYMOUS MAN
                        It is, and it isn't.
 
              ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY
 
              A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very
              sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at
              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.


                                                                     105.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        You're doing the right thing. I
                        mean, come on.  You need to start
                        your life and he... he needs a
                        warm body to cushion the fall.
                        Check out exhibit A on the front
                        lawn --
 
              POV -- THE SISTERS
 
              We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
              sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows
              Ray to the car.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
 
              Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not good at this.
 
              Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll see you this weekend, okay?
                        Promise.
 
              Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
              he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Sure you're okay to drive this?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        This rig? Phht.  No problem.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So I'll see you this weekend.
 
              She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Airight, so goodbye and --
                               (simple, with shrug)
                        I love you.
 
              Jerry blinks.


                                                                     106.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (too quick, weirdly)
                        ... I love you too, you know.
 
              She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right,
              and he knows that she knows.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, just in case this weekend
                        becomes next month and next month
                        becomes... whatever...
                               (beat)
                        Don't make a joke of your life.
                        Go back and read what you wrote.
                        You're better than the rest of
                        them, better than the Bob Sugars,
                        and don't forget it.
 
              He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She
              kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
              alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He
              watches her leave.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait a second.
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for
              her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        WAIT A SECOND!
 
              She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
              She turns and he is now close to her.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I know a way to s... to save on
                        Medical and rent and... look...
 
              He grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his
              strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
              making a sad face at him through the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  what if we stayed together?
                        What if we uh... got married.


                                                                     107.
 
 
              She looks at him.  It's an odd proposal.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        If I said that, would you stay?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say
                        that if you don't...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Will you marry me?
 
              She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In
              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
              are Chad and Dooler.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
              well-dressed BROTHER.
 
                                  BROTHER
                        Where are all your friends?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking around)
                        In the band.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend
              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.
 
              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him
              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and
              he offers the ring.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the
              hallway of the small home where the event has taken place.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wow.  We actually --


                                                                     108.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, we did.
 
              Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and
              relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the
              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the
              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (as she exits)
                        Glad we had this talk!
 
              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry.
              Confidentially:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You never had The Talk, did you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, this was another way to go.
 
              Jerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,
              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.
              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the
              room:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        This is my agent, man!  And we're
                        all gonna have a great season!
 
              He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY
 
              Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
              on.
 
              INT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY
 
              Across the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with
              Avery.


                                                                     109.
 
 
              He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the
              country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
 
              This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on
              the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell.
              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then
              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular
              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a
              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the
              t.v., Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy.
 
                                  TYSON
                               (proudly, to family)
                        That's my motherfucker!
 
              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Why don't you be the first man in
                        your family not to say that word?
                        And then we'll let you live.
 
              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (cooly)
                        That's why they cheer, you know.
                        The white man sending the black
                        man into battle...
 
              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.
 
              INT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback
              JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell.
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
              bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                        How's your head? Bubblicious.


                                                                     110.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tidwell moves to a tan in a
                        wheelchair, signs an autograph and
                        moves on.  Jerry alongside. The
                        quarterback sucks, man.  He's
                        gonna get me killed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm a little worried --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm worried too.  I'm worried that
                        the only reason I'm here getting
                        my brains blown loose is that you
                        weren't asshole enough to get my
                        ten million three months ago.
 
                                  INSANE FAN
                               (interrupting loudly)
                        FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
                        RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
                        MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
                        ROTLISS...
 
              With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
              other tired players.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd
                        don't discuss gambling with me.
 
              Insane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We can still take the offer, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (stops)
                        No.
 
              Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, just stay healthy. I will
                        show you the kwan.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Hey, that's my word, okay?
 
              Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the
              parking lot.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you in Arizona.


                                                                     111.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm gonna have the game of my life
                        on Monday Night Football, and show
                        all these motherfuckers.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, okay? You're my entire
                        client roster.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't I know.  Now go home to your
                        wife.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What's that supposed to mean?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why are you even here, man? You
                        could have told me all this over
                        the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I don't know -- how's "dedication"
                        for an answer?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You don't want to go home, do you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm asking you a question --
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, you're --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm trying to talk to you.  How's
                        your marriage?
 
              Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest
              question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not everyone has what you have.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then why'd you get married?  I'm
                        asking you as a friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (shaking his head)
                        You're jabbing at me.


                                                                     112.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm sorry I asked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm going to answer you.  You
                        want an answer?  I'll give it to
                        you.
                               (beat)
                        Loyalty.  She was loyal.
                               (unconvincing)
                        Everything grew from there.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        That's an answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Damn right.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (jab)
                        For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For
                        love, you get married.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look.  I'm happy to entertain you,
                        as always, but I have a question
                        for you.  Are we really "friends?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why not --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, friends can tell each other
                        anything, right? If we have our
                        "friends" hats on --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (wary)
                        I think so.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (intense)
                        Airight.  Here's why you don't
                        have your ten million dollars yet.
                        You are a paycheck player.  You
                        play with your head.  Not your

                        -- you're a businessman.  It's
                        wide-angle lenses and who fucked
                        you over and who owes you for it.
                        That's not what inspires people.
                        I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
                        can you handle it? Just a
                        "question," Rod.  Between friends.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I don't want to be friends anymore.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.

                        Only 'cause my wife likes your
                        wife!
 
              Jerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)

              The Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the
              table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very
              pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each
              other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body.

                        cars crashing... blood blood blood
                        blood. Is this all they think we
                        want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed
                        Shindler's List.  Give me a little

              Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this
              intricate and perfect marriage.
 
              SHOT OF MARCEE
 
              She takes a breath and gets a weird look.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        What baby?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
 
              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch
              from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder,
              looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with
              dry throat.
 
              INT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed.
              Dorothy sits down near him on the bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What were you thinking tonight?
                        Watching them go through the
                        complete human emotional
                        experience?


                                                                     115.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I was thinking I hope he doesn't
                        get injured. I felt responsible.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sometimes I can't tell at all,
                        what's going through that head of
                        yours.
 
              He makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        And I really don't know your
                        noises yet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsatisfied)
                        Okay... I will...
 
              Beat.  He feels inadequate.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why do you love me?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why do you love me?
 
              It is, of course, the better question.  And before he can
              answer, there is a pounding at the door.
 
                                  RAY
                        Jerry, can I come in and watch
                        t.v.?
 
                           DOROTHY                       JERRY
                   I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes,
                   second --                     buddy --
 
              The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed,
              stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for
              the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A
              steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen.
 
              INT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY
 
              Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
              the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing
              together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music.

              EXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
              exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
                        be in Arizona on Monday...
 
              Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.   Dorothy
              approaches.  She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
              Beat of silence.  He sees a look on her face that is
              unfamiliar.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's my fault.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's not fair to you.  This
                        whole --

                        Tell me -- let me help --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I took advantage of you and worst
                        of all, I'm not alone. I did this
                        with a kid.  I was just on some
                        ride where I thought I was in 1ove
                        enough for both of us.  I did
                        this.  And at least I can do
                        something about it now.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (damage control)
                        Well -- I'm not the guy who's
                        going to run.  I stick.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't need you to "stick."
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want...
 
                                  DOROTHY

                                  DOROTHY
                        Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (direct)
                        Dorothy -- what if I'm just not
                        built that way?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think we made a mistake here.
 
              But now he can't stop.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What if it's true?  "Great at
                        friendship bad at intimacy." I
                        mean, come on.  It's the theme of
                        my bachelor film --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I know.  I watched it.  I sort of
                        know it by heart.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (absorbs it)
                        I don't like to give up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh please.  My need to make the
                        best of things, and your need to
                        be what, "responsible"... if one
                        of us doesn't say something now we
                        might lose ten years being polite
                        about it. Why don't we call this
                        next road trip what it is.  A nice
                        long break.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What about Ray?
 
              She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        There's no question you'll be
                        friends. Of course you'll be
                        friends.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So this break... is a break-up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, Jerry.  You know this
                        isn't easy for me.

                        I mean, on the surface, you'd
                        almost think everything was fine.
                        See, I've got this great guy who
                        loves my kid --
                               (resolute, no tears)
                        -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 
              Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
              say.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I can't live that way.  It's not
                        the way I'm "built."
 
              He moves to embrace her.  She pulls away first.
 
              INT. RAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't wake up...
 
              And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's
              table.  He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac.  The
              fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him.

                               (continuing;
                                defensive)
                        ...  it was just a Mission
                        Statement...
 
              INT. AIRPORT --  DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out.  A security wand passes
              over him.  Deadness in his eyes. The glaze of the road on
              him.  Music.
 
              EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM -- ARIZONA
 
              We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
 
              The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell's family in the living room.  A buzz in the air.  The
              pregame show is on, sound-muted. Old-school on the stereo.
              Everybody is happy.  Marcee sits in the position of honor,
              her new baby KAYDEE in her arms.   She is a tired mother, and
              the family celebrates her.


                                                                     119.
 
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He'd better not mess up on Monday
                        Night Football.
 
              Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (continuing)
                        What did I say?  He gets nervous
                        for the t.v. games... it's not a
                        secret.
 
              INT. TUNNEL AREA/PRE-GAME -- NIGHT
 
              Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out
              the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle
              suit.
 
                                  PICKLE MAN
                        Nothing like Monday Night, huh?
                        What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Shouldn't you be out there doing
                        some pickle dance or something --
                        Pickle Man nods and goes out to
                        dance for the crowd.
 
                                  VOICE
                        Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
 
              Tidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready
              to feed on his insecurity.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Listen, I spoke to your
                        quarterback. He's my client, you
                        know.  And I said, "take care to
                        get those passes down, let Tidwell
                        look good on t.v."
 
              Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        You should let me do more for you.
                        I would have had you your deal by
                        tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend
                        of mine. I would have had him on
                        the air, talking about you,
                        tonight, when it counts.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Get outta here.  Go.


                                                                     120.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Where's your agent tonight?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't know.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to
                        do this now, but you belong with
                        the big boys.  You belong with the
                        money. You belong with --
 
              Here comes Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get the fuck away from my guy,
                        Sugar.
 
              Tidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent
              approach.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry!  You made it --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (off Sugar)
                        Go.  Flee.
 
              Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about
              what I said.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Thanks for coming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (bittersweet)
                        I missed ya.  What can I say?
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              They watch the game.
 
                                  GIFFORD (ON T.V.)
                        It's a bruiser out there tonight.

                        Arizona refusing to go into the
                        quiet night of this rough football
                        season. Come on, I'm trying to be
                        poetic here.
 
              Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly.


                                                                     121.

                        Ooof.  Another rough hit across
                        the middle on Rod Tidwell.
                        Nothing poetic about that.
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire moves through the box.
 
              INT. FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
              loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
              unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to
              her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only
              thing in her world, as she says:
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What does daddy say?
 
                                  TYSON
                        "It looks worse than it is...
 
              Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling
              gain on the field.
 
                                  FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        They don't pay enough for a man to
                        take that kind of ugly hit --
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (to others)
                        Boy, no s-h-i-t.
 
              Big laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He's gonna have nothing left for
                        next season.  They're letting him
                        kill himself.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can you be quiet?
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        What'd I say?
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops
              back for a pass, and is sacked.


                                                                     122.
 
 
              Philadelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier
              by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
              look at the next play.
 
              ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
 
              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies
              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
 
              TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
 
              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Silence.  Utter silence.
 
                                  GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        --   you sure hope his family
                        wasn't watching that.
 
              And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
              begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
              panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother.
 
              INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
 
              Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He
              turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a
              guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football
              field.


                                                                     123.
 
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Gathering around the television, the family waits through a
              commercial for more information on Rod's injury.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He should have kept his head
                        tucked down.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (immediately)
                        Shut up!!!
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        I'm not putting him down, I just
                        have a commitment to the truth.
 
              Marcee lunges for him.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can't you be loyal to your brother
                        who LOVES you??
                               (she is held back)
                        Get out of my house!
 
              Across the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers.
 
                                  COUSIN
                        It's Jerry Maguire!

                        He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Keep the phone open.  I'll call
                        back. Stay calm. He's got some
                        good doctors out there.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Alright, I'm freaking too.  But
                        they need you to stay calm.  I'll
                        call back.


                                                                     124.

                        Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
 
              She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
              run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
              Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
 
                                  JERRY
                        DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
 
              EXT. CENTER OF PLAYING FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,
              sleeping face.  They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out.

              Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
              silence.
 
              POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
 
              The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We
              don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly
              manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read
              their lips.  ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")  We see the
              anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer
              leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
              right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward
              each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
              of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together,
              bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.

              who blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very
              loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the
              absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd
              noise begins to rise.


                                                                     125.
 
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Let's get you off the field!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wait.
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Can you feel your legs?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for
                        a minute.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who watches.  Only marginally relieved.  Is he okay?
 
              ON FANS
 
              Crowd noise rises.  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Can he move?  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Not a breath is taken.  Is he okay?
 
              He rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he
              raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
              crowd.  Crowd noise doubles.
 
              ON MAGUIRE
 
              gasping for breath.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Has never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure
              and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans.
 
              And then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in
              a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a
              high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let
              go of the spotlight.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Going absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and
              crying.


                                                                     126.

                               (to Tee Pee)
                        You ain't talking now, are you???
                        You're a silent motherfucker!
 
              Tyson watches in silent awe of his mother.
 
              BACK ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE
 
              Finishes his small but heartfelt dance.  It is a personal
              catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (to himself)
                        Nike.
 
              He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
              casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
              with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his
              hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
 
                                  OVERHEARD FAN
                        I always knew he was great.
 
              Maguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others
              rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
 
              INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
 
              Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
              Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's
              superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association.
              We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he
              can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void.
              Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
              nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire,
              but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all.
 
                                  REPORTER
                        It's Tidwell!
 
              Tidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him.
              Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to
              squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to
              Maguire.
 
              They hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his
              purple shades.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        We did it.
 
              And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
              phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's
              Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers.


                                                                     127.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.
                               (beat)
                        It's Marcee.  She says she
                        couldn't get through on your phone.
 
              Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with
              his wife.  Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder.
 
              ON SUGAR AND SWENSON (WATCHING THEM)
 
              Bob Sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with
              his client, quarterback John Swenson.
 
                                  SWENSON
                        Why don't we have that kind of
                        relationship?
 
              INT. ARIZONA KAROAKE BAR -- NIGHT
 
              Rod Tidwell sings karoake, on stage.  He's struggling through
              U2's "One."  In the audience are many Arizona players, as
              well as most of Tidwell's family.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        One love... you got to share it...
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Tee Pee is stuck at home, babysitting twenty kids.
 
              INT. KAROAKE BAR -- NIGHT
 
              We move past many Big Men celebrating Tidwell, singing along,
              sharing their Monday Night victory, onto melancholy Jerry
              Maguire. He watches, cellular at his side, as a YOUNG AGENT
              approaches.
 
                                  YOUNG AGENT
                        Jerry Maguire.  I'm Tommy Bendis.
                        You don't know me, I'm a new
                        agent, just getting started.  I
                        represent that place kicker over
                        there.
                               (indicates kicker)
                        I wondered if you would sign this
                        for me. Because it inspired me.
 
              He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission
              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.


                                                                     128.
 
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              He feels the cover, flips through it a little.  Memories
              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think
              of Dorothy.
 
                                  AGENT
                        Just make it out "To Tommy".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tommy.  I love you.
 
              INT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry Maquire sprints through the empty airport, heading for
              the last flight out of town.  Music.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Divorced Women's Group in session.  Laurel stands near
              the doorway, blowing cigarette smoke into the night.  Dorothy
              is now a part of this group.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I've listened to you all tell a
                        thousand sob stories, and I have
                        been very judgmental. Frankly, I
                        think you've all been waaaay too
                        comfortable with your pain.  Plus,
                        Jan, you always spill your red
                        wine on the couch.
                               (off Jan's guilty
                                look)
                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
                        you're all correct. Men are the
                        enemy.
 
              Murmurs of agreement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        But I still love the enemy.
 
              Murmurs of disappointment.


                                                                     129.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.  Looks at the house.
              On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
              still a part of.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters.  Dorothy is seated toward the back.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 
              Dorothy looks up, robbed of words.  Stunned, she does not
              move.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Alright.  If this is where it has
                        to happen, then this is where it
                        has to happen.
 
              Dorothy says nothing.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm not letting you get rid of me.
                        How about that?
 
              He shares a look with some of the other women.  She's not
              going to say a word.  Neither do they.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        This used to be my specialty. I
                        was good in a living room.  Send
                        me in there, I'll do it alone. And
                        now I just... I don't know... but
                        on what was supposed to be the
                        happiest night of my business
                        life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
                        nearly close to being in the same
                        vicinity as complete, because I
                        couldn't share it with you.  I
                        couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
                        about it with you.  I missed my
                        wife.  We live in a cynical world,
                        and we work in a business of tough
                        competitors, so try not to laugh --
                               (directly)
                        I love you.  You complete me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.


                                                                     130.
 
 
              He moves to her.  They embrace.  Ray watches in b.g.  Jerry
              has given this room hope.  It's on their faces. At last, even
              Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a
              look with Chad.

                        Arizona organization, a little
                        slow, but they do come around.
                        I'm leaving somebody out...
 
              Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry
              leans over to Marcee.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you
                        at the restaurant.
 
              She nods, emotionally, biting her lip.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent!
                        This is a fierce, loving
                        individual, I love this man, he is
                        love, he is about love -- my
                        ambassador of kwan.

                        one. Wanna thank them for all my
                        Sundays, and of course my Monday
                        nights too.  That about says it...
 
              Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving. TV
              credits are rolling on the show.
 
                                  TIDWELL

              EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to
              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few
              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
              a great little throw.


                                                                     132.
 
 
              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,
              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to
              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
              say quickly to the boy:
 
                           JERRY                         DOROTHY
                   Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
 
              Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.  A family.
              Music.

              He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter

              A wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink
              with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY
              MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal
              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes
              and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic
              instrumental, "The Lonely Bull."

              INT. SMI CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
 
              The SMI agents are a fierce, happy bunch.  They sit in a
              carefully appointed conference room.
 
              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs
              of global marketing are omnipresent.  Each agent has a silver
              tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water.
              Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up
              into many cubicles.

              Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire.  The word

              INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY
 
              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility
              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering
              media members move in on the car. ("Baja!!"  "Baja, over
              here!!")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with
              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.

                        fired the shot in the 7/l1?
 
              Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking
              him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the
              police department.  Professional smile in place, Maguire
              attempts spin.
 
                                  JERRY

                        a sensational athlete.
 
              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the
              press.
 
              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY
 
              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old
              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.
              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little
              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.
 
                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you

              Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face.

                        I'm sorry little fella.  I can't
                        sign that particular brand of
                        card.  I can only sign Pro-Jam
                        Blue Dot cards.
 
              The Little Boy looks confused. As Calvin Nack turns to grab
              an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a
              business card to the little boy.

              Hockey Player STEVE REMO, 33, is a big man in a small bed.
              He is in traction, with concussion.  DOCTOR stands nearby,
              shoots Jerry a look of concern.  Family is nearby.
 
                                  DOCTOR
                        Do you know your name?

              Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face.

                        Doc. If I play in 65% of the
                        games, I make my bonus.

              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
              player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.

                        Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 
              As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (glib, easy)
                        Come on -- it'd take a tank to
                        stop your dad.  It would take all
                        five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
                        right?
 
              The kid stares at Maguire.  It feels as if the kid is peering
              into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
 
                                  SON
                        Fuck you.
 
              The kid turns and exits in disgust.  He leaves Jerry standing
              in the hallway.  Devastated. Music.
 
              EXT. RENTAL CAR SHUTTLE -- DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.  Passing through
              frame. Music.  Phone still ringing.
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Jerry sleeps.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Two nights later in Miami at our
                        corporate conference, a
                        breakthrough. Breakdown?
                        Breakthrough.
 
              Jerry's eyes open.  Breathing strangely.  Trembling, he holds
              onto the nightstand for grounding.
 
              He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar.
              Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across
              his face.  This feeling is new to him.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        It was the oddest, most unexpected
                        thing.  I began writing what they
                        call a Mission Statement for my
                        company. You know -- a Mission
                        Statement -- a suggestion for the
                        future.


                                                                     7.
 
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby.
              we watch his face, alive now.
 
              There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
              words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow
              moist.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        What started out as one page
                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was
                        my father's son.  I was
                        remembering the simple pleasures
                        of this job, how I ended up here
                        out of law school, the way a
                        stadium sounds when one of my
                        players performs well on the
                        field... I was remembering even
                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,
                        the original sports agent, who
                        said:
 
              SHOT OF DICKY FOX
 
                                  DICKY FOX
                        The key to this job is personal
                        relationships.
 
              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        And suddenly it was all pretty
                        clear. The answer was fewer
                        clients.  Caring for them, caring
                        for ourselves, and the games too.
                        Starting our lives, really.
 
              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal
              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
 
              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit
                        it. What I was writing was
                        somewhat "touchy feely."
 
              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and
              continues on, boldly.


                                                                     8.
 
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        I didn't care.  I had lost the
                        ability to bullshit.  It was the
                        me I'd always wanted to be.
 
              INT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out.
              Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the
              Night nearby.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I printed it up in the middle of
                        the night, before I could re-think
                        it.
 
              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first
              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,
              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the
              counter, for Jerry's approval.
 
                          THE THINGS WE THINK AND DO NOT SAY
                            (The Future of Our Business)
 
                                  KINKO'S GUY
                        That's how you become great, man.
                        You hang your ba11s out there.
 
              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a
              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-effacing)
                        Thanks.
 
              ON MEMOS
 
              being stuffed into mail-slots.
 
              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
 
              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.
              He looks younger, lighter.
 
              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)
 
              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing
              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.
              ("Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea
              who it was?")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he
              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,
              and dials with urgency.


                                                                     9.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh,
                        listen did those manuscripts
                        get... Oh they did... No no no no
                        no, that's fine...
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry in suit, alone with his
                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,
                        holds onto the handrail to steady
                        himself.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- DAY
 
              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission
              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously
              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the
              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB
              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.
              ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins
              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks
              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26
              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission
              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry
              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen
              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I was 35.  I had started my life.
 
              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping
              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the
              other.
 
                                  AGENT # 1 (RACHEL)
                        How long you give him?
 
                                  AGENT # 2 (CHRIS)
                        Mmmm.  A week.

              folding up into a plane, as music and credits end.
 
              INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT
 
              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but
              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working
              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.
              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy
              phone conversation with her boyfriend.


                                                                     10.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,
                        listen... I'm not going to say it
                        here.... no...
 
              Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's
              low.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        ...  oh listen, I got you the
                        perfect white shirt, at this out
                        of the way place... no... quit
                        trying to make me say it!
 
              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying
              not to listen.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        how about if I do it and don't say
                        it... mmmm... see you soon...
 
              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed
              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have to ask.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (protective)
                        What --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Where'd you find the perfect white
                        shirt?
 
              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
 
              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.


                                                                     11.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, my son is allergic to the
                        material in these blankets -
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                        That's all we have.
 
              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to
              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to
              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's okay.  We're in it together
                        now...
 
              The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't take anything I say
                        seriously! I love to flirt!
 
              Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the
              heads that belong to these voices.
 
              BACK TO JERRY AND WOMAN
 
                                  WOMAN
                        You're with the sports people on

                        Well.  Good luck with that --
 
              He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light.  Politely
              stifles another yawn.  He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep.
              Bobbi leans into his darkness.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Can I just get a quick "man's"

              INT.  FIRST CLASS SEATS -- LATER
 
              Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens
              like a priest.

                        And I can't say his name without
                        laughing I want to eat him up. I
                        want to say goodbye to every bad
                        thought I ever had about
                        relationships.  I mean, I crave
                        this guy... and yet... why... why
                        did I have that affair this
                        weekend?  Does that mean I'm not
                        in love with my boyfriend?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you'll know when you see
                        him at the gate.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        It's the death rattle of my
                        singlehood, right? Because I
                        finally see the white picket fence
                        looming and I love it/hate it/love
                        it/hate it/ love it... you're
                        right, I'll know when I see him.
                        Why is it so easy to talk with
                        you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
 
              Maguire fights another yawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I uh... don't think we're quite at
                        your pitch yet.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Tell me, and then you can sleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                        She's an NFL publicist... amazing
                        sense of style... former
                        athlete... volleyball... world
                        class... really knows how to live
                        every moment of her life, which is
                        why I should take a nap now...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Tell me how you proposed.  I
                        collect romantic proposal stories.


                                                                     13.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (impatient)
                        Oh, tell the story.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh, tell the story.
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        --so our first date, she told me
                        about her favorite place in the
                        world, the seven pools of Hana on
                        the island of Maui...
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Gorgeous.
 
                                  JERRY
                        A year-and-a-half later, we were
                        both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.
                        Now I've always hit a wall at 18
                        months.  Every serious girlfriend
                        lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka-
                        boom.  The curse of 18 months.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        That's when you need to cement,
                        and define define define.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Exactly.  And the world does not
                        need another 35 year-old bachelor.
                        I knew I wanted to propose, so I
                        took her there.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        To the pools?
 
                                  JERRY
                        To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock
                        Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock
                        Climber, but we're hiking up
                        through the pools and there's a
                        fine mist in the air, and I have
                        the ring in my pocket, and I'm a
                        little nervous, I'm lagging
                        behind, and she says to me, get
                        this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh no --


                                                                     14.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, it bothered me somewhat.
                        And I got quiet.  And now she's
                        quiet and we're both pouting a
                        little, you know.  And I decide
                        I'm not going to propose.  The
                        mood is not right. Why be
                        impulsive? Now at this point I
                        know she knows that I was going to
                        propose and didn't.  And she knows
                        I know.  So the entire sixty mile
                        ride back to the airport, we don't
                        speak. And we're both good at
                        that.  We fly to Honolulu in
                        silence.  We check into the Pro
                        Bowl hotel --
 
                                  WOMAN
                        How sad --
 
                                  JERRY
                        But wait...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story.
              The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of
              Jerry discussing his charmed life.
 
                                  RAY
                               (waking up)
                        Mama --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
 
              He sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more
              kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now little do I know that my
                        assistant. has assumed that I've
                        now proposed. So she has gotten
                        the lounge band to actually play
                        "Here Comes The Bride" when we
                        walk back in.
 
              Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to
              share the laugh with her son, who stares at her.


                                                                     15.
 
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        Which they do.  And we're standing
                        there. All the football guys are
                        in the lobby, watching, there's
                        even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to
                        her and sort of grandly say,
                        "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking
                        you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to
                        marry me." And I took out the
                        ring, and I don't much like big
                        scenes, but she said "yes" right
                        there in the lobby and some of the
                        toughest men in football wept like
                        babies.  We're getting married in
                        February.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Jerry.  You two will be together
                        forever.
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant
              Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy
              blows her nose, moved against her will.
 
                                  RAY
                        What's wrong, mom?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        First class is what's wrong.  It
                        used to be a better meal.  Now
                        it's a better life.
 
              She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been
              listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read.
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
 
              Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quietly, like a
                                coach)
                        You'll know when you see him.
                        You'll know when you see him.
 
              Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
              in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He
              holds flowers.


                                                                     16.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh my God, you're right.  I know.
                               (Jerry smiles)
                        He's not The One.  He's not the
                        One.
 
              Jerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
              faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
              couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
              crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
              loved ones.  Music.
 
              INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
              conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the
              background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Ray! Ray!
 
              Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the
              dark depths behind the flaps.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I help?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office.
                        I was on the junket to the
                        conference. I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know who y6u are.  You're
                        Dorothy Boyd.  You're in...
                        wait... you're in Accounts.  You
                        have the middle cubicle toward the
                        back with that poster of Albert
                        Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0
                        Neal's body.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Hmm.  Pretty good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now what did you lose?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My son... my mind...
 
              Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
              riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
              Delaware.


                                                                     17.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, while I go look for him, why
                        don't you hang onto this curious
                        gentleman behind you --
 
              Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
              him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks
              softly but intensely, with no frills.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Remember "imagination?"...
                        remember what that means?  Well,
                        this is one of my bosses so you
                        will now IMAGINE me screaming at
                        you right now. Do NOT do that
                        again.  Ever ever EVER.
 
              She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young
              woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a
              day.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Well, thanks.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, take care.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And have fun at your bachelor
                        party.
 
              Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy
              freezes.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Oh no.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no. I knew.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (slow sigh)
                        Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm just... anxiously looking
                        past it.  I already had my
                        bachelor party.  It was called "my
                        twenties." See you later.
 
              Jerry takes off.


                                                                     18.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I loved your memo, by the way.
 
              He stops.  Turns.  She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
              purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks... actually, it was just a
                        "Mission Statement."
 
              Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think in this age, optimism like
                        that... it's a revolutionary act.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eager for feedback)
                        You think so?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh tsht. Yes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I appreciate that, because some of
                        that stuff... you know, it was two
                        in the morning and...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- the part about "we should
                        embrace what it is still virginal
                        about our enthusiasm" --
 
              Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
              words.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        -- "and we should all force open
                        the tightly-clenched fist of
                        commerce, and give a little back
                        for the greater good.". I mean, I
                        was inspired, and I'm an
                        accountant.  Ray, don't spill my
                        coffee.
 
              Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
              hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three... swing.


                                                                     19.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey.  To respect yourself enough
                        to say it out loud, to put
                        yourself out there, so openly...
                               (shakes her head)
                        ... I don't know, it got me.
 
              Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three, swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.  May I offer you both a
                        ride?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh no.  I'm sure it would just
                        make your day to drive us all the
                        way to Manhattan Beach, taking
                        that left down to little tiny
                        Waterloo street where you have to
                        play chicken with oncoming
                        traffic, and your life flashes
                        before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
                        obviously had too much coffee and
                        all -- here's my sister Laurel to
                        pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (amused)
                        Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two...
 
              Jerry lets Ray down easy.  The kid is a little disappointed.
              But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
              He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
              Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        ... three, swing.
 
              Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits.  Dorothy
              laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
              no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
              on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, I'm double-parked.
 
              Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
              gathering Ray's toys.  She wipes at Ray's hair.


                                                                     20.
 
 
              ("Don't put food in your hair.")   She is surprised that
              she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
              She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
              looking.   He salutes her, with mock circumstance.  She
              returns it with a guilty smile.  He disappears, and she finds
              herself oddly short of breath.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must
                        be some classy babe --
 
              INT. AVERY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              AVERY BISHOR, 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch.
              They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't ever stop fucking me!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sooner... or later... I'll have to
                        stop.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been
                        better. Never BETTER!!
 
              Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Never BETTER!!
 
              The dog snaps awake, a little shook.  Avery suddenly yanks
              away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
              serious business with Avery.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Open your eyes.
                               (he does)
                        If you ever want me to be with
                        another woman for you, I would do
                        it.  I'm not interested in it.
                        There was a time, yes, it felt
                        normal for me, but it was a phase,
                        a college thing, like torn Levi's
                        or law school for you... people
                        change, but if you ever feel like
                        being adventurous in that way, I
                        would do it for you.  You want
                        anything from the kitchen I'm
                        going to get some fruit --


                                                                     21.
 
 
              She skips off like a colt.  Jerry digests what he's just been
              told.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to the next room)
                        You know.  I don't think we need
                        to do the thing where we tell each
                        other everything!
 
                                  AVERY (O.S.)
                               (laughing)
                        Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
 
              Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex
              information.
 
                                  AVERY (0.5.)
                        Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
                        have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
 
                                  JERRY (0.5.)
                        I know about the bachelor party.
 
              Avery returns.  Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway,
              is a glorious life-long project.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Who told you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        One of the accountants.
 
              She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking
              his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at
              body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked
                        his ass off to make you a tribute
                        film. All those guys from the
                        office are coming.  Everybody
                        loves you.  Just calm down, relax,
                        act surprised, and have an amazing
                        time.  And you'll never guess who
                        narrates your bachelor movie.
 
              INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He
              falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks
              around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets.
 
              THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.
 
              It is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN.


                                                                     22.
 
 
                                  MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I have often wondered where my
                        career would have been had Jerry
                        Maguire been my agent.  The
                        answer -- Yugoslavia.
 
              Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
              looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
              friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
              on steroids.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        You hear those courtesy laughs,
                        Jerry? There is a seething
                        wrongness at the edges of this
                        party.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh come on --
 
                                  DOOLER
                        This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
                        man! They should be screaming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eying crowd)
                        You're imagining it.
 
              They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a
              Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        We still having lunch tomorrow,
                        Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton
                        tested positive for marijuana.
                        That moves Cush solidly up to
                        numero uno in the draft.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Oh, that'll really help this
                        party! Let's all talk business!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (smoothly)
                        The best commercial director in
                        the business.  I hail you.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Sorry I yelled.  You have
                        exquisite taste.


                                                                     23.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Everybody's having a great time.
                        You're both nuts -- the movie's
                        great.
 
              Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        I like that guy.
 
              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)
 
                                  JERRY
                               (wounded good sport)
                        ... this is... uh... too funny...
 
                                  DOOLER
                        They ain't laughing, man.
                        Something's wrong.
 
              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks
              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
              Knoll.


                                                                     24.
 
 
              He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
              encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
              conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
              sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
              The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
              his back office.
 
                                  WENDY
                               (as in 'get ready')
                        Marcee's here.  She's already in
                        your office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks, Wendy.
 
              INT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
              waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already
              standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE
              TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking
              smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee.  How's my favorite
                        player's wife?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Jerry, Rod is very very upset.
                        Tyson, no!
 
              Across the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry
              a plexiglass case off the wall.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tyson, hello.
 
              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
              habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis
              mode like an old shirt.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        How can I make your life better?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I know you say to take the Arizona
                        offer, but my husband needs more
                        recognition.
                                  (more)


                                                                     25.
 
 
                                  MARCEE (cont'd)
                        He is the biggest, fastest,
                        raddest wide-receiver in the
                        league.  Now I don't know what you
                        do for your four-percent
 
              --The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cronin's okay for lunch?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee -- this is one of our
                        agents. This is Bob Sugar, who
                        needs to learn to knock.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Pleasure.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You've called our house, right?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Sorry to interrupt you guys.
 
              Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
              level of intensity.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Now I don't know what you do for
                        your five-percent, but this man,
                        my husband has a whole plan, an
                        image... we majored in marketing,
                        Jerry, and when you put him in a
                        Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
                        excuse me, you are making him
                        common.  He is pure gold and
                        you're giving him "Waterbed
                        Warehouse" when he deserves the
                        big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
                        line, soft-drink.  The four jewels
                        of the celebrity endorsement
                        dollar.
 
              Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
              best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        You gonna get that --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not a chance.
 
              She smiles.

                                                                     26.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Marcee, things are changing around
                        here.  You and Rod will have my
                        total personal attention.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (upping the ante)
                        Damn right, and you can start by
                        taking Rod's poster and putting it
                        where people can see it!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it's infectious)
                        Damn right.
 
              He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
              poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
              the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Look at that handsome man, trying
                        to build a life up there by the
                        air-conditioner. We're coming to
                        get ya, darlin!  We are so close
                        to having it all!
 
              ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
 
              It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
              second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,
              27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl
              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.
              Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash
              ("Tyson!").
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON
 
              Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
              sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
                        Arizona contract... new glass
                        cabinet...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking up)
                        I'm fine.  What's up?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I came here to let you go.


                                                                     27.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Pardon me?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 
              For a long moment there is only silence.  They study each
              other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
              other's next three or four moves.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        It's real, Jerry.  You... you
                        should say something.
 
              Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit...the crowded
                        restaurant... so there's no
                        scene...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
 
              In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
              "Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You...
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (razor sharp)
                        You did this to yourself.  You
                        said "fewer clients."  You put it
                        all on paper.  Scully was very
                        upset.  Heart attacks make some
                        people sweeter, but not him.  You
                        did this to yourself --
 
              Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
              speak, Sugar continues.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        -- although I do gotta hand it to
                        you.  For about five minutes you
                        had everyone applauding smaller
                        revenues.
 
              Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You... ungrateful... unctuous...


                                                                     28.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (unctuous)
                        ... dick?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dick.
 
              Maguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes
              jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Give me a little credit for doing
                        this face-to-face!  What I went
                        through knowing I was going to do
                        this to my mentor!  Can you get
                        past yourself for a second?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You'll lose.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (musically)
                        You wanted smaller.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm over it.  Now I want all my
                        clients and yours too.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Jerry --
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- and I'll get 'em.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (patronizing)
                        You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
                        Always always always.  We're
                        bringing other elements in, we're
                        focusing on endorsements -- it's
                        not about handholding anymore.
                        We're no longer babysitters --
 
              Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the
              table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
              Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
              mind.  Rising percussive music.
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
              lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.


                                                                     29.

              Sugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone.

              sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a
              good time.

              Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to
              the back office.  Music
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a
              breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom
              drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer,
              a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third
              smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he
              dials.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY
 
              Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young
              football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still
              playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks.
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the
              personality of whomever he talks to.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob
                        Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
                        first 'cause you're the most
                        important guy in sports...
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax
              into the machine at the same time.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Carla, right now you're paying 25%
                        of your endorsments to SMI, I
                        would cut my commission by 7%...
 
              As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once
              proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom
              drawer.


                                                                     30.
 
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You read that memo I snuck to you,
                        the guy's tired of the job.  Tired
                        of making you money.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all
              while he talks quickly on the phone.
 
                                  JERRY

              Several other agents working the cause behind Sugar, who
              breezes through the calls.

              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the
              right and left of her are the phones are ringing.


                                                                     31.
 
 
              Something is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts
              Exec CLEO, 32.

                        They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it
                        at Cronin's.
 
              Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat.
              She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her
              roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office
              door.

              KATHY SANDERS, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch.
              Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past
              endorsements. Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the
              Olympics. Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her,
              listening in on the extension.  The Mission Statement is
              folded open on Dad's lap.  Kathy chokes on every other word,
              such is her anguish.
 
                                  KATHY
                        I already heard from Bob Sugar.
                        Jerry I want to cry for what they
                        did to you at SMI.  You helped me

              There is a click on the line.  She is pained and outraged.

              ROD TIDWELL, 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen.  He
              is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new
              cellular phone. He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as
              he talks.  In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee
              Tidwell.
 
                                  ROD TIDWELL
                        "How am I doing?"  I'll tell you.

              Sugar works off a wristwatch.  He spends no longer than three
              minutes on each call.

                        to cough...
 
              He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular
              with another call on it.

              Back to the other call.

              Tidwell walks down the hallway, past clippings and citations
              from his career. Marcee follows, always listening.

                        Maguire --
 
              We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of
              Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in
              Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version
              of his brother.  He says into the phone:
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        Hello Jerry Maguire.

              Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the
              house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family
              monitoring the important call.

                        to be a "superstar," man!  Are you

              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Sugar has three phones going.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Killer, Steve, good decision.
                               (next call)
                        So it's yes, right?  Excellente.
                               (next call)
                        Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES!
 
              Tidwell enters bedroom.  Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        --  now to recap, I want to stay
                        in Arizona, I want my new
                        contract, I like you, you're nice
                        to my wife, I will stay with you,
                        that's what I'm doing for you, but
                        here's what you're gonna do for
                        me. You listening?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (dying)
                        Mmm.  Hmm.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        It's a very personal, very
                        important thing.  It's a family
                        motto.  So I want to share it with
                        you.  You ready?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Here it is.  "Show me the money."
                               (pause)
                        Show.  Me.  The.  Money.


                                                                     36.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I got it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Now doesn't that just make you
                        feel good to say it?  Say it with
                        me.
 
              The lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a
              chance to turn his own light on.  He sits in the oncoming
              darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone
              bank on the desk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Congratulations.  You're still my
                        agent.
 
              Tidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters
              his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe
              collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        An African-American man running
                        with a little ball, working for
                        white owners and white agents.
                        It's the iconography of rascism...
                               (off Tidwell's
                                dismissive look)
                        ... but I woulda stayed at the
                        bigger company.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself
              on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.
              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks
              back and symbolically flips the light switch off.
              Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off.
              So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly
              turned the lights on.
 
              EXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Bam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He
              is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
              Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.


                                                                     37.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, don't worry!  I'm not going
                        to do what you think I'm going to
                        do, which is FLIP OUT!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
 
              Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
              a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
              face..
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But let me just say, as I ease out
                        of the office I helped build --
                        sorry, but it's a fact --
 
              ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
 
              from her cubicle.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- that there is such a thing as
                        manners.  A way of treating
                        people...
 
              He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        These fish have manners!  They
                        have manners.
 
              And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
              Another cup of water as he finds power.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        In fact.  They're coming with me!
                        I'm starting a new company, and
                        the fish will come with me and...
                        you can call me sentimental.
 
              He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
              that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; to fish)
                        it's okay... it's okay...
 
              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.


                                                                     38.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But if anybody else wants to come
                        with me, this moment will be the
                        ground floor of something real and
                        fun and inspiring and true in this
                        godforsaken business and we will
                        do it together!  Who's coming with
                        me besides... "Flipper" here?
 
              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Anybody going with me?
 
              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
              second.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Wendy?  Shall we?
 
              Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.  Painfully polite:
 
                                  WENDY
                        I'm three months away from the pay
                        increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh...
                        you know, stay.
 
              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the
              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, anybody else?
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd
              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,
              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
              onto herself in the process.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'll go with you.
                               (quietly, on her
                                coffee mess)
                        Wonderful...


                                                                     39.
 
 
              She dabs at her pants.  Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              halfway across the office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 
              She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        We will see you all again.  Sleep
                        tight!
 
              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
 
              WIDE-SHOT
 
              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the
              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the
              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to Dorothy)
                        Let's see how they do without us.
 
              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
              carcass of an immense beast.
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
 
              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wonder what he said.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My favorite aunt is hearing
                        impaired. He said "you complete
                        me."


                                                                     40.
 
 
              They continue on in silence.
 
              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud
              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building
              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze
              through with boxes and fish.
 
              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So I know this is a bad time,
                        but -- you will have a medical
                        program, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
 
              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him
              briefly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And I guess we didn't talk about
                        money.  So, I'll just dive in --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Give me your number.  I'll call
                        tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm
                        a little insane right now.
                               (off her look)
                        But it's going to be great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no, I know --
 
              They arrive at her red Camry.  She writes her number on the
              back of a business card.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I mean really... wonderfully...
                               (out of steam)
                        great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsure)
                        Absolutely.
 
              She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when you think about what
                        you've done later, don't panic.


                                                                     41.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good
                        bet.
 
              She starts the engine.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        That took guts.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
              She salutes him as she drives off.  His own move, played back
              to him.  Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
              the parking lot.  Salutes her in return.  Herb Alpert.  "The
              Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
              seems puny.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
              in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's
              voices.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced
              Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks
              shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks.
              She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in
              this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses)
 
                                  JAN
                        I love men.  I respect men.  But
                        that doesn't change the fact that
                        most of them belong in cages...
 
              The other nine women nod with deep understanding.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her
              nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no-
              frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of
              her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid-
              argument.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        What about medical?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Of course, medical!


                                                                     42.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (unconvinced)
                        You are a single mother.  You have
                        given up the right to be frivolous.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (irritated)
                        If you'd read what he wrote, you
                        would have left with him too.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (more irritated)
                        You know how much those Well Child
                        exams cost --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (overlapping)
                        Of course I know --
 
                                  LAUREL/DOROTHY
                        A hundred and fifty dollars.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        And that's just when he's well --
 
              They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then:
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait. Where is he?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        He's in the living room asleep.
 
              Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wonderful.  Next time you lecture
                        me, don't leave my little boy in
                        a room with your Divorced Women's
                        Group...
 
              She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the
              garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she
              says it so nobody can hear:
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Sorry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's
              Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In
              frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the
              group.


                                                                     43.
 
 
                                  ALICE
                        Okay I've finally, finally, gotten
                        my anger straight here.  I'm going
                        to visualize Carl being here and
                        finally tell him --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhhh!
 
              Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 
              INT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT
 
              She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The
              enormity of the day arrives with a thud.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        What did I do?
 
              INT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on.
              They are both in a manic state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The power move is to go
                        unannounced.
                               (sotto)
                        Black suit, right?
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotto)
                        And the egyptian cotton shirt that
                        works with or without the jacket.
                               (full volume)
                        Tell me again, how was it left
                        with Cush?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (perfect imitation)
                        "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Ugh!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (turns, with clothes)
                        Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.
                               (sotto)
                        Jacket on, tie in pocket.


                                                                     44.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotta)
                        Good.
                               (full volume)
                        They're all heatseekers!  All of
                        them, everybody. You keep one
                        superstar and they'll all follow.
                        There's no real loyalty, and the
                        first person who told me that,
                        Jerry Maguire, was you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think I was trying to sleep with
                        you at the time.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Well, it worked, and I will not
                        let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma-
                        fuckin-guire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's right.
 
                                  AVERY
                        King of the Housecalls! Master of
                        the Living Room!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, this is working.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You are not a loser.
 
              Jerry stops, turns.  The way she says "loser" is the most
              elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
              hot dog.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Who said anything about "loser?"
                        Where do you get this word "loser?"
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I
                        meant something else.  When do you
                        want to leave?
 
              Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut.  He is packed and ready.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Let's go.  I'll drive you.


                                                                     45.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (stops, an odd
                                thought)
                        What if I don't get him?
 
              Avery takes his bag, heads for the door.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Function function function.
                        Forward motion is everything.
                        Cush saves all.
 
              Jerry takes a breath, exits.  Music.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up.  Music continues.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR -- MORNING
 
              Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever.
 
              Music continues.
 
              EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry exits car.  Adjusts the jacket.  Takes the tie off too,
              returns to the car and tosses it inside.  He walks to the
              front door with purpose.  Suddenly an intercom crackles,
              jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
 
              Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
              the upper-corner of this rustic home.  The door buzzes.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
 
              Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush
              memorabilia.  Righteous indignation building.
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        I'm in the back den, Jerry.
 
              He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
              at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
              A large draped American flag above the bar.  He is a J. Crew
              cowboy.
 
                                  MATT
                        You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
                        Beer and tomato juice --


                                                                     46.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No thanks.
 
              Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Matt, I came here because in all
                        honesty your son is just another
                        piece of cattle to SMI.  But to
                        me --
 
                                  MATT
                               (overlapping)
                        We decided to stay with you.
 
              On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman.  The move surprises
              them both.  And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few
              surprising tears of relief.  He has been spared.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, thank you.
 
                                  MATT
                        Told myself -- if he shows up,
                        we'll stick with him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know, I'm not a hugger and
                        yet... I can't let go.
 
              Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen.  Little
              brother KEITH, 14, enters with him.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
 
              INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
 
              Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-
              wheel table" where decisions are made in this house.  Jerry
              is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again.
 
                                  MATT
                        I want him to go number one in the
                        draft, and I want him to play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's either going to be Denver or
                        San Diego trading up to take him.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (big grin)
                        Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
                        don't care.


                                                                     47.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        Denver is where he should be.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll give it everything.
 
                                  MATT
                        You know I don't do "contracts."
                        But'cha do have my word, and it's
                        stronger than oak.
 
              Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer.  A good day.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
 
              Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's
              the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he
              knows the words, but...
 
                                  JERRY
                               (sings)
                        Feelin...
 
              He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
              channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will
              ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds
              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
              He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches
              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
              response of the song, like a happy idiot.
 
              INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery
                        there? Where can I reach her?
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about
              the new arrangement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta,
                        didn't leave me her hotel number.


                                                                     48.
 
 
              Through the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red
              hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through
              life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces
              of wood and a hammer.
 
                                  CHAD
                        The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 
                                  RAY
                               (jumping)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey -- later, okay?
                               (Ray jumps on her)
                        Whoop.  Wait.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (back to phone)
                        Sorry, that's my son and the
                        nanny. I had the calls transferred
                        to my home so I could go over your
                        stuff.
 
              Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He
              sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, that's fine.  What calls came
                        in today?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait.  That's yesterday, from the
                        other office. Today is...
 
              She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to
              today, which is blank.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        ... light.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shit, it's just so frustrating to
                        not be able to talk to Avery --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Wait a minute, it has to be one of
                        the NFL hotels we do business
                        with -- let me look -- but in the
                        meantime, about this job --


                                                                     49.
 
 
              She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through
              a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood
              news:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (importantly)
                        Dorothy, let me tell you
                        something, we are back. We are so
                        very very back.  I re-signed Cush.
                        We're set.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We are?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's all going to work.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I just got goosebumps.
 
              She examines her own skin with surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (manic, quiet)
                        It's all going to work.  We're
                        going to save the world.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well, I'm happy for you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Happy for us.
 
              Oddly, the phrase affects her physically.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Happy for us... okay.  Here's the
                        number. 404-453-2222.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Call me later, hon.
 
              She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them
              stare at her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 
                                  CHAD
                               (laughing)
                        Yeah, Dotty. You did.


                                                                     50.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Twenty six years old.  I'm already
                        saying "hon". Hug your mother
                        quickly --
 
              Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy.
              Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.

              INT. ATLANTA HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
 
              Avery in mid-conference with four other NFL men in background.
 
                                  AVERY
                        YA-HOOOO-SIE!
 
              It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls
              back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed.
              In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers.
              Part of them lusts after her.  The larger part knows she
              would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know.  Sorry I threw a scare
                        into our lives there --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't worry about it -- I never
                        told you what I thought of that
                        memo either --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, no you didn't --
 
                                  AVERY
                        You lost your head, it happens.
                               (quickly)
                        I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen.
                        I'm going to have to fly to
                        Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we
                        meet in the Dallas airport and we
                        all fly into New York together for
                        the draft?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a plan --  --


                                                                     51.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'll set it up with your girl.
                        Woo!  This is when it's good,
                        Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love
                        it.  And when I see you, I'm going
                        to give you the best blow job of
                        your life.
 
              He hangs up, staring at the phone. In the room with Avery,
              the co-workers look at each other. She is far, far out of
              their league.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S CAR -- LATER MORNING -- DRIVING
 
              Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity
              fills the car. On the radio, a sports station debates the
              future of Cushman. as Jerry whips through a stack of sports
              pages.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Avery'll meet you at the B gate at
                        4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will
                        already be there.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (nods to Ray)
                        Hey, man, you know they have big
                        balloons built into cars?
 
                                  RAY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        They do, my brother.
 
                                  RAY
                               (giggling)
                        I'm not your brother!
 
              Dorothy continues, business on her mind.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... I put Tidwell on the same
                        floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I
                        think it's great you're taking him
                        to the draft. He doesn't smoke,
                        right? I have no idea.


                                                                     52.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have no idea.
                               (continuing to Ray)
                        So Ray, if there's an accident or
                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --
                               (simulates air-bag)
                        -- and you go booooong.  And
                        you're safe.
 
              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is
              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her
              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers
              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,
              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
              this guy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, have we gone over
                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,
                        Ray.  Wish me luck.
 
                           DOROTHY                       RAY
                   Luck.                         LUCK!
 
              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the
              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,
              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small
              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on
              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the
              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,
              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of
              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and
              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,
              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.
              ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?"  "You gonna
              be rich, dude!") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he
              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid
              approaches Tidwell.
 
                                  KID
                        Are you Hootie?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        No man, I'm not Hootie.
 
              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone
              know his stardom, his essence, his power?


                                                                     53.
 
 
                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
                        All those disabled, and Frank
                        Cushman can board now...
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY
 
              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes
              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits
              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at
              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (a big thought)
                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes
                        reward the evil and punish the
                        good?
 
              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Let me think about that.  Want
                        something to drink?
 
                                  CUSH
                               (thoughtful pause)
                        I see what you're saying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  What do you mean?
 
              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell
              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey man, I wish I had a
                        quarterback like you in Arizona.
                        You're the shit.
 
              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Thank ya.
 
              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't
              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (loud mumble)
                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin
                        good.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Say what?


                                                                     54.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus
                        Christ was still in heaven.  And
                        you ain't even played in the NFL.
 
              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell
              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.
 
                                  JERRY
                        This can't be happening to me.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry!  Do something --
 
              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.
 
                                  JERRY
                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,
                        five years old?  Am I taking the
                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow
                        up, both of you!  We are a family.
                        And we go to the draft in an
                        ORDERLY FASHION.
 
              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too
              much.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Me too, dude.  Especially that big
                        old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's
                        just insanity, man.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Heard that.
 
              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.
              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles
              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She
              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites
              her.
 
              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
 
              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.


                                                                     55.
 
 
              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.
 
              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
 
              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        At last I find you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (sharply)
                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel
                        like I'm five years late for the
                        Prom.
 
              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on
              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's
              ego.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're
                        going to take a walk through this
                        lobby. I want every media guy,
                        every player rep, everybody to see
                        you for what you are.  The best-
                        kept secret in the NFL. The
                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.
                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever
                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em
                        see how big you are.  You ready?
                        Let's do it.
 
              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (begrudgingly)
                        A'right.  Let's walk.
 
              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus"
              from Live at Leeds.


                                                                     56.
 
 
              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past
              the reporters, the competing agents, the team
              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a
              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones
              everywhere, in every hand.
 
              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,
              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and
              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does
              not sit down.  Music continues.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY
 
              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire
              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry
                        Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the
                        draft...
 
              INT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT
 
              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone
              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All
              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming
              draft selections.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I
                        can buy a decent quarterback.
                        Who's he talking to?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        They don't look interested do they?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Actually...
 
              Wilburn looks concerned.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the
              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve
              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.


                                                                     57.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I came all the way here for that?
                        To walk the lobby?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  And it might have even
                        worked too.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Let's do it again.
 
              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a
              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is
              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell
              continues talking.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        You believe they're shooting a
                        Nike ad down there?  Did I ever
                        tell you my Nike story?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I gotta get back to Cushman.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it
                        down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they
                        do is ignore me...
 
              Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know what was great about you
                        down there?  For about five
                        minutes, you unloaded that rather
                        expansive, let me just say "large"
                        chip that resides right there on
                        your shoulder, and you know what?
                        You were brilliant.  Take care.
 
              Jerry starts to exit.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (mock serious)
                        I'm not about love -- I'm about
                        "showing you the money."
 
              Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.


                                                                     58.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good.  I was just testing ya.
                               (beat)
                        But just you saying that? Makes me
                        love ya.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Sure you don't want to go out and
                        find some karoake?  I'm a very
                        good singer, man --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Call me tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I might call you later!
 
              Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A
              small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs.
 
              INT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.
              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,
              sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food
              abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend
              ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the
              man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,
              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues
              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's
              "Something In The Way."  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (to hotel waiter)
                        Hey, what size are you?
 
                                  WAITER
                        Eleven.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (grandly)
                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs
                        of them new Nikes by the door --
 
              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.
 
                                  WAITER
                        Dude, you're like a God.


                                                                     59.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                               (immediately)
                        God, you're like a dude.
 
              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma,
              the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues
              strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
                        to make.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
                        they Don't have any feelings...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay. San Diego just came in with
                        a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Something in the way.  Yeah."
 
                                  MATT
                        Well, he's gotta go number one.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Ooooooo."
 
                                  JERRY
                        He still goes number one, but San
                        Diego wants to trade up with New
                        England -- they want him bad.
 
              Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
              the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
 
                                  MATT
                        What happened to Denver?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Denver got very silent about a day
                        ago.  San Diego's got a fever for
                        Cush.  This stuff tends to happen
                        the night before a draft.  People
                        get crazy.  And San Diego, you
                        should know, is crazy to the tune
                        of seven years for thirty. Signing
                        bonus of eight.
                               (beat)
                        Million.
 
              Anne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed,
              and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is
              ringing.


                                                                     60.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        I don't know, Jerry.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Should I unplug the phone?
 
                                  CUSH
                        Reporters, Jerry.  They been
                        callin' all night.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Just be friendly and say "no
                        comment."
 
                                  CUSH
                        Talking and saying nothing, man,
                        it's an art I have not mastered.
 
              Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the
              ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "This is Cush."
 
              Suddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens.
 
              INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        It's Sugar.  He must be there,
                        right? Just sniff or something if
                        he's there.
                               (Jerry sniffs,
                                panicked)
                        Alright, buddydude.  Just
                        remember. You're swimming with the
                        big boys now. You let your dad do
                        all the talking.  I'm the one who
                        got you the deal you needed.  This
                        is business not friendship. Be
                        strong.  You're global now.
 
              Sugar hangs up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "No comment.
 
              Jerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is
              spinning.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
                        again!


                                                                     61.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
                        got "Cushlash."
 
              More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
              speaks casually, directly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, before I go back to Denver.
                        I think we should put something
                        down on paper.  Something that
                        says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
                        Maguire."
 
              He pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few
              lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
 
                                  MATT
                        Not right now, Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do I know everything there is to
                        know here?
                               (silent beat)
                        You fellas aren't talking with Bob
                        Sugar, are you?
 
              More silence.
 
                                  MATT
                        Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
                        with him instead of you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quickly)
                        Said who?  Sugar?
 
                                  MATT
                        Hey, I'm learning as I go.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
                        with Denver behind my back?
 
                                  MATT
                        I'm sorry, I --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I brought Denver to twenty
                        million. Denver deals with me all
                        the time. You listened to Sugar?
                        You let that snake in the door.
 
              Jerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself.


                                                                     62.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll
                        fix this up.  You didn't sign
                        anything with Sugar, right?
 
              Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (blurts)
                        Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
                        a famous athlete and I'm gonna
                        sign with you'.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shut up!
                               (beat)
                        I'm sorry... sorry.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (sympathy for Jerry)
                        S' cool.
 
              Shot moves in on Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually
                        sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
                        you didn't sign.
                               (beat)
                        Because I'm still sort of moved by
                        your "my word is stronger'n oak"
                        thing --
 
                                  MATT
                        We signed an hour ago.  You were
                        in the lobby with the black fella.
 
              Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
              things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
 
                                  CUSH
                        I'm sorry, Jerry.
 
                                  MATT
                        They say it's show "business,"
                        Jerry, not show friends.
 
              Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
              settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
              all it's neon logo glory.


                                                                     63.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well. Okay. Of course. You're
                        twenty years old, and I'm just
                        another guy in a suit.  It's all
                        business. It didn't work out.  You
                        didn't buy my product, which is,
                        unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
                        there's a speech that I'm supposed
                        to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
                        there cheering for you." "The door
                        is always open!"  See? I'm a class
                        act.
                               (breath, directly)
                        But maybe this would have all
                        worked, us being real human
                        beings, coming through for each
                        other, really, and now I'll never
                        know. You'll never know. Weren't
                        you curious?
                               (they aren't)
                        No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine.
                        And you'll be fine.  And Keith I
                        bope you do call me.
 
              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the
              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
              guitar.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby
              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.
 
                                  PATRICIA LOGAN
                        Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
                        had three concussions?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm sorry... excuse me...
 
              INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.


                                                                     64.
 
 
              INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I just heard.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do I do?  How do I spin this?
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh honey.  It's spun.
 
              She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What did I do to you?
 
              She is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know?
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's all about you, isn't it?
                        Soothe me, save me, love me --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Could you just stop moving?
 
                                  AVERY
                        I have to finish my job --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Everything's on the fucking run!
                        Everything --
 
              She stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  You and I are salespeople.
                        We sell --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, I don't want a --
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's not "love me."  It's not
                        "trust my handshake."  It's make
                        the sale. Get it signed.  There
                        shouldn't be "confusion" about
                        that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Go ahead.  Jump right on into my
                        nightmare.  The water's warm.


                                                                     65.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        So honesty is outlawed here, I
                        can't be honest?
 
              She turns and exits again.  He follows.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell you what -- I'd prefer
                        loyalty..
 
                                  AVERY
                        What was our deal when we first
                        got together?  Brutal truth,
                        remember?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you added the "brutal."
 
              She stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a
              troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
                        thing that some people have.  I
                        don't have it.  I don't cry at
                        movies.  I don't gush over babies.
                        I don't start celebrating
                        Christmas five months early, and
                        I don't tell a man who just
                        screwed up both of our lives --
                        'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For
                        better or worse.  But I do love
                        you.
 
              Jerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery
              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
              different to him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery --
 
              She knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't say it.  We're both ragged
                        out right now.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- stop --
 
              She exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she
              stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly
              interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
              45.


                                                                     66.
 
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                        Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the
                        Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you
                        two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
                        Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
                        Hello!
 
              Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis
              gets a whiff of what he walked into.
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                               (continuing; exiting
                                quickly)
                        Goodbye!
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm warning you.  Don't say it.
                        You won't have another chance.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me!
 
                                  AVERY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's over --
 
              She continues moving into the next room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Didn't hear it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        There is something missing here.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You've never been alone and you
                        can't be alone --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me, it's over.
 
              She can barely believe it.  She blinks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        No one has ever dumped me.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not trying to make history.


                                                                     67.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I did the 23 hour nose-route to
                        the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
                        I can make this work.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        No.
 
              She takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small
              voice of her vulnerability.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (steps closer)
                        You know I didn't ever want to
                        hurt you.
 
              She gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away,
              then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with
              the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
              hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He
              sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him,
              addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
                        I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
 
              INT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING
 
              Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
              Both wear sunglasses.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You love me now, don't you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Very much.
 
              ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
 
              is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
              athlete.
 
              INT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY
 
              Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight.
              Jerry nurses a stiff drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Everybody on this show cries now.


                                                                     68.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (off t.v. )
                        You feel bad you tested positive?
                        Quit doing blow!  You feel bad
                        about your baby girl? Why did you
                        leave the mother?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What are you doing with me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Huh?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't you even see -- I'm
                        finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
                        hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
                        a cautionary tale!
 
              Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        See this jacket I'm wearing?  You
                        like it?  I don't really need it,
                        because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
                        I lost the number one draft pick
                        the night before the draft. They
                        will teach my story to other
                        agents on "do not do this" day in
                        agent school. Why? Let's recap.
                        Because a hockey player's kid made
                        me feel like a superficial jerk,
                        I had two slices of bad pizza,
                        went to bed, grew a conscience and
                        wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The least you could do is nod and
                        act sympathetic --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a quality that might come in
                        handy for a commercial sometime.


                                                                     69.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You are not allowed to act this
                        way.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why not?
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY
 
              They sit together. Jerry holds another drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Man, I got a shelf life of ten
                        years, tops!  My next contract's
                        gotta bring me the dollars that'11
                        last me and mine a very long time.
                        I'm out of this sport in five
                        years.  What's my family gonna
                        live on? What you get me.  So I
                        don't want to hear about ya shit,
                        your "nya nya nya."
 
                                  JERRY
                               (ruefully, to
                                attendant)
                        Another drink please.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Anybody else would have left you
                        by now, but I'm sticking with you.
                        I said I would. And if I got to
                        ride your ass like Zorro, you're
                        gonna show me the money.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (the hell that never
                                ends)
                        Oh my God.
 
              He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only
              room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
              sits in it.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's coming over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        At eleven at night?


                                                                     70.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He just lost his best client.  He
                        called from the plane.  I invited
                        the guy over.

                        Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
                        is a "syndrome."  It's called
                        Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
                        Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-

                        Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing
                        all that, you still allow him to
                        come over, more power to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey, he's engaged.  And for the
                        first time in my professional
                        life, I'm a part of something I
                        believe in.
 
              Dorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Okay, but he better not be good
                        looking!
 
              INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy puts Ray to bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        'Night buddy.  This is my favorite
                        part of your head.
 
              She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the
              mirror.
 
              She checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall
              above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
              later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, turn here!  Sharp right
                        turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 
              The cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both
              sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.


                                                                     71.
 
 
              Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same
              with the oncoming car.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
              hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (super pleasant)
                        You seem just the way I pictured
                        you. I'm her disapproving sister
                        Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Honesty.  Thank you.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi.
 
              The lights are low and his glasses are very dark.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Thanks for inviting me over.
                        Where's the little guy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep.  Watch out for that
                        lamp.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
 
              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.


                                                                     72.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with
                        Avery.
 
              Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
              quite understand.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Too bad.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Better now than later.  We'll
                        still be friends. I'm dying here.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        And just think if I got her the
                        ring she really wanted.
 
              Dorothy laughs.  He looks at her strangely.  Suddenly she
              feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a
                        seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
                        for that cut too.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do you have something to drink?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure --
 
              She moves to the kitchen door.  She is about to exit, when
              Jerry begins to unburden.
 
                                  JERRY
                        My brother works for the White
                        House. He pretends he's an
                        intellectual.  He pretends he's
                        from the east coast.
 
              She turns, not quite sure what his point is.  She waits
              politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I was supposed to be the
                        successful one.
                                  (more)


                                                                     73.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        But I don't want to talk about it.
                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a
                        religion --you don't bitch.  No
                        moaning!  Head down.  Do it,
                        whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
 
              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
              taking.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Beer okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, thanks.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
              Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        I heard.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No kidding.  I looked over and saw
                        the shadow of two curious shoes in
                        the doorway of the kitchen.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        This guy would go home with a
                        gardening tool right now if it
                        showed interest.
                               (off Dorothy's look)
                        Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Look, here's some of that chicken
                        with salsa too, I warmed it up --


                                                                     74.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That's the girl I love.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        But you just gotta hear me out on
                        one thing.  You're very
                        responsible with Ray and you know
                        it's not right for a little boy to
                        hear some strange man's voice in
                        the house.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        As opposed to twenty angry women?
 
              Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
              collide in the small kitchen.  Dorothy deftly catches the
              food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate.  But
              her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
              Laurel takes command.  They know each other well.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, let's get you another
                        top --
 
              They exit to nearby laundry room.
 
              EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
              showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
              room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room
              and stare at Jerry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
              up to see Ray.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi Ray.
 
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
 
                                  LAUREL
                        All I'm saying.  You don't have
                        the luxury of falling for some
                        drowning man.  Be practical.  Now.
                        Which top?
 
              She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down
              front. The other is striped, cute, functional.


                                                                     75.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, you want to talk about
                        practical? Let's talk about my
                        wonderful life. Do you know what
                        most other women my age are doing
                        right now? They are partying in
                        clubs, trying to act stupid,
                        trying to get a man, trying to
                        keep a man... not me. I'm trying
                        to RAISE a man.
 
              She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
                        of Roger, for the rest of my life.
                        I have had three lovers in four
                        years, all boring, all achingly
                        self-sufficient all friends of
                        yours I might add, and all of them
                        running a distant second to a warm
                        bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at
                        me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in
                        the world!  How do I look?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
              piece of rope.
 
                                  RAY
                        And then my dad died and my mom
                        took me to the zoo and I love the
                        zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
                        love the zoo?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  I want to tell you more
                        about my dad.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  I've been hogging it.
                        You're right.
                                  (more)


                                                                     76.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        All my life I've been trying to
                        talk, really talk, and no one
                        wants to listen.  You know that
                        feeling?
 
              Ray nods vigorously.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go right now.  Let's go to
                        the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
                        the zoo is closed.
 
                                  RAY
                        You said "fuck".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah I know.  I did.
 
              Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee.
 
                                  RAY
                        I won't tell.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll go to the zoo sometime.
                        Okay? I think I might have some
                        time on my hands.
 
              Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
 
                                  RAY
                        I don't see any.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (points respectfully)
                        Funny.
 
                                  RAY
                        Funny...
                               (imitates him)
                               (hears mom
                                approaching)
                        I better go to bed.
 
              Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid
              for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
              appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
              attitude, and a tray.


                                                                     77.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you
                        a cab.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (slightly confused)
                        Good idea.  Thank you.
 
              And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little
              boy asleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Right.  Of course.
 
              Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
              not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it,
              inelegantly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So.  Our company.
 
              She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
              little. Then stands.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 
              He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your.
                        Job.
                               (beat)
                        Our company is in good shape. You
                        and your son... we... are just
                        fine.  You still have a job. I
                        want you to feel confident!  In.
                        Me.  And I have a problem with
                        people who talk about themselves
                        in the third person, but let me
                        tell you something about Jerry
                        Maguire.
 
              His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
              poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Come after me and you will lose I
                        am a survivor!  Do not
                        underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've
                        got wits!
                                  (more)


                                                                     78.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        I've got the instincts of a
                        panther!
                               (joust)
                        I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about me.  I can get
                        jobs --
 
                                  JERRY
                        We will be fine!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- especially one like this.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I am...
 
              He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
              stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I am drunk.
 
              He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head.
              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the
              personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
              tip of the aloe vera plant.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Truth?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure.
 
              Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
              visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She
              gets closer.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure, I care about the job.  Of
                        course.  But mostly...
                               (very honest)
                        ...  I want to be inspired.
 
              There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
              "inspiring."
 
                                  JERRY
                        Me too.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What you wrote inspired me.


                                                                     79.
 
 
              He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A
              woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm working with you because of
                        that memo...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Mission... statement...
 
              They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool
              hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The
              taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on
              her breast.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sorry about this hand.
                               (he rises unsteadily)
                        You know that feeling -- you're
                        not completely embarrassed yet,
                        but you glimpe tomorrow's
                        embarrassment?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about it, boss.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh shit.  You said "boss."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah, I did.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  No don't feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I do.  I feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
                               (the worst day ever)
                        I'm like... harrassing you...
                        right now.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I may not sue.
 
              He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry
              rubs his face.  And then:


                                                                     80.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, good evening.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good evening.
 
              He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll be okay.  And I'm going to
                        take my... one client and we're
                        gonna go all the way.
 
              He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
              little.  He is a mess, and he knows it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; loving
                                the dark humor)
                        Hey. I'm back.
 
              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking
              back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
              He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
              He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM
              we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
              look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We gotta talk about his contract,
                        Dennis.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Your timing is impeccable,
                        Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
                        you ever lost Cush...


                                                                     81.
 
 
              Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
 
              Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear
              a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
              signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I started talking with Dennis
                        Wilburn about your renegotation.
 
              Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Did you tell him about the "ten
                        million for four years?"
 
                                  JERRY
                        Uh, not today, but --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre
                        Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools,
                        and yet they're making the big
                        sweet dollars. They're making the
                        money, and I got an agent that
                        ain't even put the number on the
                        table.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I understand your anxiety.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Maybe you don't.  Because it's not
                        just the money I deserve.  It's
                        not just the "coin."  It's the...
 
              He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        --  the kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's your word?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
                        community... and the dollars too.
                        The package.  The kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (impressed)
                        But how did you get "kwan?"


                                                                     82.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        I got there from "coin," dude.
                        Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Great word.  Towel?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, I air-dry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I say this with great
                        respect, but those players you
                        mentioned are marquee players
                        and --
 
              A portable phone beeps.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Is that your porty or mine?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You.
 
              Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and
              answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
                        in the new agent.  He says I'm not
                        marquee.  I know... I know...
 
              Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
              Marcee going off.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        My wife is upset with you.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
 
              The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
              mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on,
              gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
              be listening.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Here's what I'm saying.  This is
                        a renegotiation.  We want more
                        from them, so let's show them more
                        from us. Let's show them your pure
                        joy of the game, let's bury the
                        Attitude a little, let's show
                        them --


                                                                     83.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        You're telling me to dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm saying to be --
 
              He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (little voice)
                        "Love me love me love me... put me
                        on t.v."
                               (pissed)
                        That's the iconography of rascism,
                        man!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm
                        telling you to be the best version
                        of you, to get back to the guy who
                        first started playing this game.
                        Way back when you were a kid.  It
                        wasn't just about the money, was
                        it?
 
              Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Do your job, man, don't tell me to
                        dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
              He begins gathering his things.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm an athlete, not an
                        entertainer. These are the ABC's
                        of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 
              Jerry rubs face.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        What's wrong.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Forget it.  Forget it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No tell me.


                                                                     84.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm out here for you!  You don't
                        know what it's like to be me out
                        here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
                        pride-swallowing seige that I will
                        never fully tell you about! Okay?!
                        Help me help you help me help you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're hanging by a very thin
                        thread, dude.  And I dig that
                        about you.
 
              Jerry has had enough for one day.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (loopy, punch-drunk,
                                arms flailing)
                        Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you!
                        I'll see you in L.A.!
 
              Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        See, man, that's the difference.
                        between us.  You think we're
                        fighting, I think we're finally
                        talking!
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
              thought.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They
              are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
              encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his
              calls.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
                        to say he's faxing in the new
                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
                        and you'll be happy.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (jolted into
                                happiness)
                        Happy. He said "happy?"
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Actually he said "glad."


                                                                     85.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Plus, you could use that
                        commission.
 
              She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a
              quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I sunk most of what I had into
                        this condo, which devalued, and --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        You don't have to explain.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, the other night, I want to
                        apologize.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (can't read her)
                        Yeah, what happened there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We're two people working together
                        and we can't have an atmosphere.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm relieved you said that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I mean, the other night was... I
                        felt like you understood something
                        I could barely even say, something
                        way down deep in the murk --
                               (beat)
                        -- but we have a company here to
                        think about.  I won't ever take
                        advantage of you in that way again.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Oh good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You walked out on a job for me,
                        and I won't ruin that.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Exactly because I know this is a
                        time when you need to be alone
                        with your thoughts.
                                  (more)


                                                                     86.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Think about everything that's gone
                        wrong, how to fix them, and just
                        be... alone, alone, alone.
 
              Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want to go out to dinner?
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her
              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
 
                                  JAN
                        I broke up with the Cowboy. And
                        now he's stalking me...
 
                                  ALICE
                        What's the current definition of
                        stalking?
 
                                  WOMAN # 1
                        Coming over uninvited.
 
                                  JAN
                               (thoughtful)
                        So Romeo under the trellis... was
                        a stalker.
 
              Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as
              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,
              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
              wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging
              Jerry.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.


                                                                     87.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (outdressed)
                        Wow.  That's more than a dress.
                        That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
                        the idea of an evening among
                        adults -- no offense buster.
                               (then)
                        You meet Chad the nanny?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
                        I guess I didn't realize we were...
 
              He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The
              cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new
              sensation for this bachelor.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't let him stay up too late.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (grandly)
                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
                        teach Ray about jazz.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good, that'll put him to sleep
                        early. No offense.
 
              She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
 
                                  CHAD
                        You know, you people have a jazz
                        problem in this house.
 
              Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
 
                                  RAY
                        I wanna go too.
 
              Laurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
              room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bye you guys.


                                                                     88.
 
 
              Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down
              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
              one.
 
              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
 
              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on
              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
              the lawn. "All Shook Down."  Replacements.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of
              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
              them.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Hey!
 
              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
              have privacy with her sister.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (continuing)
                        Forgot your keys --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (privately)
                        That's the first time I ever saw
                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
                        that just... thrilling?
                               (eyes tear up)
                        I mean, he must have been needing
                        that.
 
              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        No no.  Don't cry at the beginning
                        of the date.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (laughing, wiping
                                tear)
                        Oh, knock it off!


                                                                     89.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (can't help it)
                        And don't be a shoulder for him to
                        cry on either.
 
              We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music
              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
              street.
 
              INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican
              restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It was laziness1 my whole breakup
                        with Avery. You know that thing
                        you say, "it's nobody's fault."
                        It's one of the great lies, right?
                        Someone is always to blame -- if
                        you go for it, go for it like you
                        do a job, work at it --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Maybe love shouldn't be such hard
                        work. I know, but --
 
              Mariachis approach the table.
 
                                  HEAD MARIACHI
                        A song for the lovers?
 
                                  JERRY/DOROTHY
                               (too quickly)
                        No.  No thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We work together.
 
              Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so,
              reluctantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        See, you choose. If you fall for
                        someone, if you make a commitment,
                        you should make it work.  It's
                        only when "options" entered the
                        picture that things got bad. I'm
                        speaking historically now.  It's
                        a modern day concept,
                        nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel?
                        -- I think the only good thing to
                                  (more)


                                                                     90.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        come from this period in history
                        is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Maybe you should call her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no no.  I just underestimated
                        her...
                               (touches wound)
                        her temper, I guess.  Why are we
                        even talking about this?
 
              A FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses.
 
                                  FLOWER GIRL
                        A rose for the lady.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want a --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        (   (scoffs)
                        No.  No way.
 
              Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage
                        to Roger was so great, even
                        before --
                               (stops herself)
                        Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (simply)
                        Let's not tell our sad stories.
 
              Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be right back. Quit thinking
                        those murky thoughts, okay? We're
                        young, we're semi-successful. Life
                        is good.
 
              She exits and we hang on him for a moment.


                                                                     91.
 
 
              INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No, now... come on... let Chad
                        catch the bee in a glass.  He
                        won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
                        such a good heart. I love you,
                        I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to
                        see you.
 
              EXT. BATHROOM
 
              Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
              happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
              a mournful "Tears in Heaven."  She smiles at the image, in
              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
              in another direction.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, let's take a walk.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the
              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well -- this would be goodnight.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              They don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you tomorrow.
 
              They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
              close. Kisses him.  It's a good one.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.
              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
              she's brought back from the restaurant.


                                                                     92.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing; breath)
                        I think you should not come in, or
                        come in depending on how you feel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right.  I'll come in.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay. Wait here a second.
                               (beat, then)
                        Do we really want to do this?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (half-unsure)
                        Oh hell yes.
 
              She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when
              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now
              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
              evidence.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep, right?
 
                                  CHAD
                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Still going.
 
              Chad raises his eyebrows.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Shhh.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the
              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and
              down.
 
                                  CHAD
                        Treat her right, man.  She's...


                                                                     93.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... well...
 
                                  CHAD
                        She's great.  And I know this is
                        a little awkward, but I want you
                        to use this.
 
              Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat
              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a
              cassette tape.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (continuing; intense)
                        This... is Miles Davis and John
                        Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two
                        masters of freedom, playing in a
                        time before their art was
                        corrupted by a zillion cocktail
                        lounge performers who destroyed
                        the legacy of the only American
                        artform -- JAZZ.
 
              Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
              Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
 
              INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
 
              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
              gone.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What is this MUSIC?
 
              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter
              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
 
              Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night
              joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter
              from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers
              her sister brought back from dinner.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
              Radio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the
              digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls
              on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on
              toys.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
              possible drops of coffee.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm getting him up, don't worry.'
                        Ray will never see his mother's
                        raging physical needs.
 
              She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.

                                  DOROTHY
                        No--
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
 
              Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.

                        who, because of the way things are
                        going, may not have an emotional

              listening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
              honesty an agent rarely hears.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... so what am I, for taking the
                        opportunity, Laurel?

                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am
                        I a bad person? All I know is that
                        I found someone who was charming
                        and popular and not-so-nice to
                        me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why
                        should I let this guy go, when
                        everything in my body says This
                        One is The One.

                        Easy, hon, I was just looking for
                        fun details --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
                        And oh, I don't know if you're
                        interested in this detail, but I
                        was just about to tell you that I
                        love him.  I love him, and I don't
                        care what you think.  I love him
                        for the guy he wants to be, and I
                        love him for the guy he almost is.
                        I love him.
 
              They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              rubbing his face.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi Jerry!
 
              Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
              there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway
              in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
              to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
              her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh God.

              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.

                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but
                        I won't, I heard everything.
                               (to Laurel)
                        Thank you for your honesty, as
                        always.

                                  JERRY
                        Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders
                        prefer cereal first --
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's have Apple Jacks!
 
              Apple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still
              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly
              complete-looking family.
 
                                  RAY
                               (continuing)
                        What's going on, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        A lot.  We got a big fax today...
                        we need this commission, buddy.
 
              The sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels
              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs
              and continues to feel happy.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
              cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That was great of you this morning.
 
              The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (friendly, dismissive)
                        Look, let's just root for a big
                        offer so we can move out of this
                        room to a real office.
 
              She feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a
              window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
 
              ON FAX
 
              Connecting.

              FOUR FACES
 
              waiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax.
              Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts
              her eyes.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Read it to me, and don't say
                        anything unless it's over nine.
 
              There is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart
              sinks.  His face slackens.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit --
 
              Rod turns away.  Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        One-point-seven for three years.
                        That's below average.  We owe more
                        than that...
 
              It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
              in a seat too small for him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll go back to them.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (explodes)
                        And say what?  "Please remove your
                        dick from my ass?!"
 
              Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant
                        right now.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I feel like crying.  I feel like
                        breaking the room up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, we don't take this
                        emotionally. We roll with this
                        problem.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What are you talking about --
                        "don't get emotional." If you ask
                        me, you haven't gotten emotional
                        ENOUGH about this man.

                        Marcee --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What DO you stand for???
 
              Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        How about a little piece of
                        integrity in this world that is so
                        filled with greed and a lack of
                        honorability that I don't know
                        what to tell my kid except take a
                        look at a guy who isn't shouting
                        "show me the money," he's quietly
                        broke and working for you for free!
                               (off Jerry's pained
                                look)
                        Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
                        at the insults as she is.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        No, that was pretty good.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (impressed)
                        No shit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        In fact, you should read something
                        that meant the world to me...
 
              She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
              is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
              swiftly intercepts it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Another time, okay Dorothy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Fine, I just --
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I appreciate that impulse.
 
              Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
              Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
              without his protective shield of attitude.  Scared.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You
                        tell me to eat lima beans, I'll

                        If you say take the shitty deal,
                        that's all we can get --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "All we can get?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
 
              Marcee is passionate.  Focused on Rod.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You know what you're qonna do,
                        Rodney. You're gonna reject this
                        shitty contract. You're gonna play
                        out your existihg shitty contract
                        and go be a free agent next year
                        and the hell with Arizona. This is
                        us, and we determine our worth.
                        You're a fine, proud, surviving,
                        splendid black man.
 
              Beat.  Truer words...  The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Honey, you are just --
 
              No one else in the world exists.  They are focused totally on
              each other.  Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
              watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        -- the shit.
 
              She caresses the back of his neck.  He pulls her to him.  He
              gives her a small kiss.  Dorothy and Jerry look at the
              couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable.  There is a
              palpable forcefield around the Tidwells.  They are a couple
              in every passionate sense of the word.  After a beat:
 
                                  JERRY
                        If you get injured, you get
                        nothing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Won't happen.  I'm strong in my
                        mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a risk.
 
              Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
              implications of the decision.


                                                                     100.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like
                        I bet on you.
 
              Tidwell puts his hand out.  Maguire is conflicted, but he
              takes a breath and shakes.
 
              EXT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Tidwell and Marcee exit.  Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll get you some quick work --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good deal, man.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm sorry what I said back there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't be silly.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My husband believes in you.  We're
                        gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Take care you guys.
 
              Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The
              Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Look...  I was up for a job in San
                        Diego before I left SMI. It's with
                        the Chargers.

              touching down.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't even talk about that yet.
                        I'll find something fast for
                        Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
 
              EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
 
              Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
              commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large
              Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
              director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is
              arguing with Tidwell.


                                                                     101.
 
 
              Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a
              camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bill, Rod, wait --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Dude, know your art form.  If you
                        put the camera down here, looking
                        up, I look more powerful.  There's
                        no need for a camel... you got ME.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, get on the camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                               (shoots look to Jerry)
                        The sponsor wants a camel --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry, back me up.  It's either
                        the camel or me...
 
              Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
              stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (takes the bullet)
                        Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him
                        out of this.  This isn't what I
                        had in mind anyway.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Then you shouldn't have begged me
                        to hire him.
 
              EXT. SET -- LATER
 
              Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the
              background, another athlete rides the camel.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        There you go, dude.  You're
                        learning how to represent me.  We
                        ain't gonna bring Nike to their
                        knees with some regional camel
                        ad --
 
              Jerry rubs his face.


                                                                     102.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I ask you a question totally
                        unrelated to your career?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh, we gonna be friends now?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do you know about dating a
                        single mother?
 
              Tidwell warms to the personal question.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by
                        a single mother.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell me, because it's been a
                        month, and she's about to take
                        another job in San Diego.
 
              Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        First, single mothers don't
                        "date." They have been to the
                        circus, you know what I'm saying?
                        They have been to the puppet show
                        and they have seen the strings.
                        You love her?
 
                                  JERRY
                        How do I know?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You know when you know.  It makes
                        you shivver, it eats at your
                        insides. You know?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I don't know.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then you gotta have The Talk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I sure don't like that she's
                        leaving.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, that ain't fair to her.  A
                        single mother, that's a sacred
                        thing, man.


                                                                     103.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        The kid is amazing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.  A real man does not shoplift
                        the "pooty" from a single mom.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We
                        were thrown together and -- I mean
                        it's two mutual people who --
                               (a look)
                        Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
 
              INT. ZOO -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's
              arm. Life-changing decisions in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        They offered me everything I asked
                        for, it's only 2 hours away. I
                        think it's good for us.
 
              Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray.
              They approach the reptile house.
 
                                  RAY
                        Show me the animal, Jerry!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right up ahead, buddy --
 
              They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is
              gathered.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        -- I give you my favorite animal
                        in the zoo.  Are you ready for the
                        weirdness, the strange perfection
                        and truth of...
 
                                  RAY
                        I'm scared.  What is it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's in a cage.  Do not be scared
                        of...
 
              A few people peel away, revealing...


                                                                     104.

                               (continuing)
                        The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
 
              THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two
              heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other
              for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from
              "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn
              away.
 
                                  RAY
                        Whoa.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (quietly)
                        Two heads.  My God...
 
              Jerry is happy to play tour-guide.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Both heads have brains.  Both
                        heads eat, both heads battle for
                        direction all day long.
                               (meaningful)
                        Man, can I relate.
 
              The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly.
 
                                  RAY
                        Me too.
 
              Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to
              Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Is this a guy thing?
 
                                  ANONYMOUS MAN
                        It is, and it isn't.
 
              ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY
 
              A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very
              sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at
              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.


                                                                     105.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        You're doing the right thing. I
                        mean, come on.  You need to start
                        your life and he... he needs a
                        warm body to cushion the fall.

              POV -- THE SISTERS
 
              We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
              sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows
              Ray to the car.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
 
              Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not good at this.
 
              Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll see you this weekend, okay?
                        Promise.
 
              Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
              he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Sure you're okay to drive this?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        This rig? Phht.  No problem.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So I'll see you this weekend.
 
              She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Airight, so goodbye and --
                               (simple, with shrug)
                        I love you.
 
              Jerry blinks.


                                                                     106.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (too quick, weirdly)
                        ... I love you too, you know.
 
              She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right,
              and he knows that she knows.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, just in case this weekend
                        becomes next month and next month
                        becomes... whatever...
                               (beat)
                        Don't make a joke of your life.
                        Go back and read what you wrote.
                        You're better than the rest of
                        them, better than the Bob Sugars,
                        and don't forget it.
 
              He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She
              kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
              alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He
              watches her leave.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait a second.
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for
              her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        WAIT A SECOND!
 
              She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
              She turns and he is now close to her.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I know a way to s... to save on
                        Medical and rent and... look...
 
              He grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his
              strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
              making a sad face at him through the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  what if we stayed together?
                        What if we uh... got married.


                                                                     107.
 
 
              She looks at him.  It's an odd proposal.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        If I said that, would you stay?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say
                        that if you don't...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Will you marry me?
 
              She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In
              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
              are Chad and Dooler.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
              well-dressed BROTHER.
 
                                  BROTHER
                        Where are all your friends?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking around)
                        In the band.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend
              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.
 
              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him
              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and
              he offers the ring.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the
              hallway of the small home where the event has taken place.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wow.  We actually --


                                                                     108.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, we did.
 
              Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and
              relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the
              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the
              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (as she exits)
                        Glad we had this talk!
 
              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry.
              Confidentially:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You never had The Talk, did you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, this was another way to go.
 
              Jerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,
              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.
              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the
              room:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        This is my agent, man!  And we're
                        all gonna have a great season!
 
              He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY
 
              Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
              on.
 
              INT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY
 
              Across the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with
              Avery.


                                                                     109.
 
 
              He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the
              country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
 
              This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on
              the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell.
              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then
              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular
              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a
              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the
              t.v., Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy.
 
                                  TYSON
                               (proudly, to family)
                        That's my motherfucker!
 
              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Why don't you be the first man in
                        your family not to say that word?
                        And then we'll let you live.
 
              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (cooly)
                        That's why they cheer, you know.
                        The white man sending the black
                        man into battle...
 
              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.
 
              INT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback
              JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell.
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
              bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                        How's your head? Bubblicious.


                                                                     110.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tidwell moves to a tan in a
                        wheelchair, signs an autograph and
                        moves on.  Jerry alongside. The
                        quarterback sucks, man.  He's
                        gonna get me killed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm a little worried --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm worried too.  I'm worried that
                        the only reason I'm here getting
                        my brains blown loose is that you
                        weren't asshole enough to get my
                        ten million three months ago.
 
                                  INSANE FAN
                               (interrupting loudly)
                        FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
                        RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
                        MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
                        ROTLISS...
 
              With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
              other tired players.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd
                        don't discuss gambling with me.
 
              Insane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We can still take the offer, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (stops)
                        No.
 
              Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, just stay healthy. I will
                        show you the kwan.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Hey, that's my word, okay?
 
              Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the
              parking lot.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you in Arizona.


                                                                     111.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm gonna have the game of my life
                        on Monday Night Football, and show
                        all these motherfuckers.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, okay? You're my entire
                        client roster.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't I know.  Now go home to your
                        wife.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What's that supposed to mean?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why are you even here, man? You
                        could have told me all this over
                        the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I don't know -- how's "dedication"
                        for an answer?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You don't want to go home, do you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm asking you a question --
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, you're --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm trying to talk to you.  How's
                        your marriage?
 
              Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest
              question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not everyone has what you have.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then why'd you get married?  I'm
                        asking you as a friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (shaking his head)
                        You're jabbing at me.


                                                                     112.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm sorry I asked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm going to answer you.  You
                        want an answer?  I'll give it to
                        you.
                               (beat)
                        Loyalty.  She was loyal.
                               (unconvincing)
                        Everything grew from there.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        That's an answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Damn right.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (jab)
                        For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For
                        love, you get married.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look.  I'm happy to entertain you,
                        as always, but I have a question
                        for you.  Are we really "friends?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why not --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, friends can tell each other
                        anything, right? If we have our
                        "friends" hats on --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (wary)
                        I think so.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (intense)
                        Airight.  Here's why you don't
                        have your ten million dollars yet.
                        You are a paycheck player.  You
                        play with your head.  Not your
                        heart.  In your personal life?
                               (points)
                        Heart. But when you get on the
                        field --

                                                                     113.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                               (finger rises to
                                Tidwell's head)
                        -- you're a businessman.  It's
                        wide-angle lenses and who fucked
                        you over and who owes you for it.
                        That's not what inspires people.
                        I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
                        can you handle it? Just a
                        "question," Rod.  Between friends.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I don't want to be friends anymore.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Beautiful.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (angry)
                        We still having dinner in L.A.?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (anqry)
                        Only 'cause my wife likes your
                        wife!
 
              Jerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        "No heart."  "No heart?"
                               (yells after him)
                        I'm all heart, motherfucker!
 
              He gets on the bus.
 
              INT. CRAB RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the
              table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very
              pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each
              other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        -- so I go to see a so-called
                        "black" film the other day --
                               (then)
                        -- honey, no more salt for you, I
                        don't want you dehydrated for
                        Monday Night Football.  Most
                        important game of your career.

                               (then)
                        -- TWENTY minutes of coming
                        attractions. All black films, all
                        violent, I'm talking about
                        brothers shooting brothers, Wesley
                        Snipes with guns the size of our
                        house, killing, blood flowing,
                        cars crashing... blood blood blood
                        blood. Is this all they think we
                        want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed
                        Shindler's List.  Give me a little
                        credit, I mean hooo --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I hate you going to movies alone
                        withoutme --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Oh baby --
 
              He cracks more crab, gives her the biggest piece.
 
              SHOT OF JERRY AND DOROTHY
 
              Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this
              intricate and perfect marriage.
 
              SHOT OF MARCEE
 
              She takes a breath and gets a weird look.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        What baby?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
 
              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch
              from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder,
              looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with
              dry throat.
 
              INT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed.
              Dorothy sits down near him on the bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What were you thinking tonight?
                        Watching them go through the
                        complete human emotional
                        experience?


                                                                     115.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I was thinking I hope he doesn't
                        get injured. I felt responsible.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sometimes I can't tell at all,
                        what's going through that head of
                        yours.
 
              He makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        And I really don't know your
                        noises yet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsatisfied)
                        Okay... I will...
 
              Beat.  He feels inadequate.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why do you love me?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why do you love me?
 
              It is, of course, the better question.  And before he can
              answer, there is a pounding at the door.
 
                                  RAY
                        Jerry, can I come in and watch
                        t.v.?
 
                           DOROTHY                       JERRY
                   I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes,
                   second --                     buddy --
 
              The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed,
              stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for
              the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A
              steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen.
 
              INT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY
 
              Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
              the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing
              together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music.

              EXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
              exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
                        be in Arizona on Monday...
 
              Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.   Dorothy
              approaches.  She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
              Beat of silence.  He sees a look on her face that is
              unfamiliar.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's my fault.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's not fair to you.  This
                        whole --

                               (instant crisis mode)
                        Tell me -- let me help --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I took advantage of you and worst
                        of all, I'm not alone. I did this
                        with a kid.  I was just on some
                        ride where I thought I was in 1ove
                        enough for both of us.  I did
                        this.  And at least I can do
                        something about it now.

                               (damage control)
                        Well -- I'm not the guy who's
                        going to run.  I stick.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't need you to "stick."
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't know --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        ...my soul or something.


                                                                     117.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (direct)
                        Dorothy -- what if I'm just not
                        built that way?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think we made a mistake here.
 
              But now he can't stop.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What if it's true?  "Great at
                        friendship bad at intimacy." I
                        mean, come on.  It's the theme of
                        my bachelor film --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I know.  I watched it.  I sort of
                        know it by heart.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (absorbs it)
                        I don't like to give up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh please.  My need to make the
                        best of things, and your need to
                        be what, "responsible"... if one
                        of us doesn't say something now we
                        might lose ten years being polite
                        about it. Why don't we call this
                        next road trip what it is.  A nice
                        long break.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What about Ray?
 
              She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        There's no question you'll be
                        friends. Of course you'll be
                        friends.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So this break... is a break-up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, Jerry.  You know this
                        isn't easy for me.

                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        I mean, on the surface, you'd
                        almost think everything was fine.
                        See, I've got this great guy who
                        loves my kid --
                               (resolute, no tears)
                        -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 
              Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
              say.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I can't live that way.  It's not
                        the way I'm "built."
 
              He moves to embrace her.  She pulls away first.
 
              INT. RAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't wake up...
 
              And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's
              table.  He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac.  The
              fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing;
                                defensive)
                        ...  it was just a Mission
                        Statement...
 
              INT. AIRPORT --  DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out.  A security wand passes
              over him.  Deadness in his eyes. The glaze of the road on
              him.  Music.
 
              EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM -- ARIZONA
 
              We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
 
              The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell's family in the living room.  A buzz in the air.  The
              pregame show is on, sound-muted. Old-school on the stereo.
              Everybody is happy.  Marcee sits in the position of honor,
              her new baby KAYDEE in her arms.   She is a tired mother, and
              the family celebrates her.


                                                                     119.
 
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He'd better not mess up on Monday
                        Night Football.
 
              Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (continuing)
                        What did I say?  He gets nervous
                        for the t.v. games... it's not a
                        secret.
 
              INT. TUNNEL AREA/PRE-GAME -- NIGHT
 
              Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out
              the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle
              suit.
 
                                  PICKLE MAN
                        Nothing like Monday Night, huh?
                        What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Shouldn't you be out there doing
                        some pickle dance or something --
                        Pickle Man nods and goes out to
                        dance for the crowd.
 
                                  VOICE
                        Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
 
              Tidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready
              to feed on his insecurity.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Listen, I spoke to your
                        quarterback. He's my client, you
                        know.  And I said, "take care to
                        get those passes down, let Tidwell
                        look good on t.v."
 
              Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        You should let me do more for you.
                        I would have had you your deal by
                        tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend
                        of mine. I would have had him on
                        the air, talking about you,
                        tonight, when it counts.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Get outta here.  Go.


                                                                     120.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Where's your agent tonight?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't know.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to
                        do this now, but you belong with
                        the big boys.  You belong with the
                        money. You belong with --
 
              Here comes Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get the fuck away from my guy,
                        Sugar.
 
              Tidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent
              approach.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry!  You made it --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (off Sugar)
                        Go.  Flee.
 
              Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about
              what I said.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Thanks for coming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (bittersweet)
                        I missed ya.  What can I say?
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              They watch the game.

                        quiet night of this rough football
                        season. Come on, I'm trying to be
                        poetic here.
 
              Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly.


                                                                     121.

                        Ooof.  Another rough hit across
                        the middle on Rod Tidwell.
                        Nothing poetic about that.
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire moves through the box.
 
              INT. FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
              loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
              unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to
              her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only
              thing in her world, as she says:
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What does daddy say?
 
                                  TYSON
                        "It looks worse than it is...
 
              Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling
              gain on the field.
 
                                  FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        They don't pay enough for a man to
                        take that kind of ugly hit --
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (to others)
                        Boy, no s-h-i-t.
 
              Big laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He's gonna have nothing left for
                        next season.  They're letting him
                        kill himself.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can you be quiet?

              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops
              back for a pass, and is sacked.


                                                                     122.
 
 
              Philadelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier
              by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
              look at the next play.
 
              ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
 
              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies
              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
 
              TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
 
              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Silence.  Utter silence.
 
                                  GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        --   you sure hope his family
                        wasn't watching that.
 
              And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
              begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
              panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother.
 
              INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
 
              Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He
              turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a
              guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football
              field.


                                                                     123.
 
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Gathering around the television, the family waits through a
              commercial for more information on Rod's injury.

                        He should have kept his head
                        tucked down.

                        I'm not putting him down, I just
                        have a commitment to the truth.
 
              Marcee lunges for him.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can't you be loyal to your brother
                        who LOVES you??

                        Get out of my house!
 
              Across the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers.
 
                                  COUSIN
                        It's Jerry Maguire!

                        Keep the phone open.  I'll call
                        back. Stay calm. He's got some
                        good doctors out there.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Alright, I'm freaking too.  But
                        they need you to stay calm.  I'll
                        call back.

                        Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
 
              She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
              run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
              Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
 
                                  JERRY
                        DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
 
              EXT. CENTER OF PLAYING FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,
              sleeping face.  They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out.
 
              SHOTS OF NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCES
 
              1)   A full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday
              Night Football.
 
              2)   Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell
              pinned to the screen.
 
              3)   Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t.V.

              Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
              silence.
 
              POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
 
              The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We
              don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly
              manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read
              their lips.  ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")  We see the
              anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer
              leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
              right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward
              each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
              of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together,
              bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              who blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very
              loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the
              absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd
              noise begins to rise.


                                                                     125.

                        Let's get you off the field!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wait.
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Can you feel your legs?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for
                        a minute.

              Crowd noise rises.  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Can he move?  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Not a breath is taken.  Is he okay?
 
              He rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he
              raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
              crowd.  Crowd noise doubles.
 
              ON MAGUIRE
 
              gasping for breath.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Has never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure
              and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans.
 
              And then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in
              a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a
              high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let
              go of the spotlight.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Going absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and
              crying.

              Finishes his small but heartfelt dance.  It is a personal
              catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people.

                        Nike.
 
              He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
              casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
              with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his
              hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
 
                                  OVERHEARD FAN
                        I always knew he was great.
 
              Maguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others
              rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
 
              INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
 
              Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
              Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's
              superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association.
              We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he
              can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void.
              Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
              nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire,
              but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all.
 
                                  REPORTER
                        It's Tidwell!
 
              Tidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him.
              Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to
              squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to
              Maguire.
 
              They hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his
              purple shades.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        We did it.
 
              And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
              phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's
              Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers.


                                                                     127.

                        It's Marcee.  She says she
                        couldn't get through on your phone.
 
              Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with
              his wife.  Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder.

              well as most of Tidwell's family.

              We move past many Big Men celebrating Tidwell, singing along,
              sharing their Monday Night victory, onto melancholy Jerry
              Maguire. He watches, cellular at his side, as a YOUNG AGENT
              approaches.
 
                                  YOUNG AGENT
                        Jerry Maguire.  I'm Tommy Bendis.
                        You don't know me, I'm a new
                        agent, just getting started.  I
                        represent that place kicker over
                        there.
                               (indicates kicker)
                        I wondered if you would sign this
                        for me. Because it inspired me.
 
              He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission
              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.


                                                                     128.
 
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              He feels the cover, flips through it a little.  Memories
              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think
              of Dorothy.
 
                                  AGENT
                        Just make it out "To Tommy".

              The Divorced Women's Group in session.  Laurel stands near
              the doorway, blowing cigarette smoke into the night.  Dorothy
              is now a part of this group.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I've listened to you all tell a
                        thousand sob stories, and I have
                        been very judgmental. Frankly, I
                        think you've all been waaaay too
                        comfortable with your pain.  Plus,
                        Jan, you always spill your red
                        wine on the couch.
                               (off Jan's guilty
                                look)
                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
                        you're all correct. Men are the
                        enemy.
 
              Murmurs of agreement.

                               (continuing)
                        But I still love the enemy.
 
              Murmurs of disappointment.

              Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.  Looks at the house.
              On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
              still a part of.

                                  JERRY
                        Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 
              Dorothy looks up, robbed of words.  Stunned, she does not
              move.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Alright.  If this is where it has
                        to happen, then this is where it
                        has to happen.
 
              Dorothy says nothing.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm not letting you get rid of me.
                        How about that?
 
              He shares a look with some of the other women.  She's not
              going to say a word.  Neither do they.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        This used to be my specialty. I
                        was good in a living room.  Send
                        me in there, I'll do it alone. And
                        now I just... I don't know... but
                        on what was supposed to be the
                        happiest night of my business
                        life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
                        nearly close to being in the same
                        vicinity as complete, because I
                        couldn't share it with you.  I
                        couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
                        about it with you.  I missed my
                        wife.  We live in a cynical world,
                        and we work in a business of tough
                        competitors, so try not to laugh --
                               (directly)
                        I love you.  You complete me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.


                                                                     130.
 
 
              He moves to her.  They embrace.  Ray watches in b.g.  Jerry
              has given this room hope.  It's on their faces. At last, even
              Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a
              look with Chad.
 
                                  JAN
                               (sloshing wine)
                        I think we'd better go...
 
              INT. ROY FIRESTONE SHOW -- NIGHT
 
              Roy Firestone leans forward.
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                        ...your father who left the family
                        on Christmas eve, the mother who
                        cleaned the steps of a prison to
                        make your tuition. The older
                        brother who lost a leg in that
                        tragic bass fishing accident --
 
              Tidwell is wearing glasses now, in a somewhat scholarly mode.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.

                        -- well, Rod, your agent passed me
                        a note before the show. He says
                        that your deal memo has been
                        signed by the Arizona Cardinals.

              ON TIDWELL -- WEEPING
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I... I love everybody, man.  I
                        love my wife.  My kids.  Little
                        Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My
                        brother Tee Pee. I love my
                        friends, my teammates, who am I
                        leaving out?
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                               (laughing)
                        It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY
 
              watching off-camera.  Marcee crying too.  Shot takes us to
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray.


                                                                     131.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wanna send some beautiful love out
                        to my offensive line, just a
                        beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna
                        thank a beautiful individual --
                        God, and of course the entire
                        Arizona organization, a little
                        slow, but they do come around.
                        I'm leaving somebody out...
 
              Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry
              leans over to Marcee.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you
                        at the restaurant.
 
              She nods, emotionally, biting her lip.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent!
                        This is a fierce, loving
                        individual, I love this man, he is
                        love, he is about love -- my
                        ambassador of kwan.
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                        Ten seconds, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        And I love my fans, of which he is
                        one. Wanna thank them for all my
                        Sundays, and of course my Monday
                        nights too.  That about says it...
 
              Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving. TV
              credits are rolling on the show.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        Wait!  And thank you Melvin from
                        the Casual Man, thank you for the
                        suit...
 
              EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to
              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few
              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
              a great little throw.


                                                                     132.
 
 
              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,
              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to
              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
              say quickly to the boy:
 
                           JERRY                         DOROTHY
                   Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
 
              Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.  A family.
              Music.
 
                                                       FADE OUT
 
 
 
                                                 THE END

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK

               JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript 
               subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen 
               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces 
               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object 
               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned 
               curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking 
               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless 
               latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It started with a chair.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT

               FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's 
               sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers 
               herself onto his lap.

               A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.

                                     WHISPERED VOICE
                         Do you know how long I've wanted 
                         this?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah.

                                     WHISPERED VOICE
                         Wizard.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED

               A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

                                     JUNO
                         Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob 
                         for a second, okay?

               We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away 
               from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         This is the most magnificent discarded 
                         living room set I've ever seen.

               She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and 
               wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

               BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:

               Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a 
               jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of 
               juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly 
               on a mission.

               EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 
               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.

               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 
               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 
               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 
               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

               She enters the DRUGSTORE.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

               ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from 
               behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

                                     ROLLO
                         Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the 
                         Crime Dog! Back for another test?

                                     JUNO
                         I think the last one was defective. 
                         The plus sign looked more like a 
                         division sign.

               Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

                                     JUNO
                         I remain unconvinced.

               Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

                                     ROLLO
                         This is your third test today, Mama 
                         Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt 
                         about it!

               An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and 
               lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

                                     TOUGH GIRL
                         Three times? Oh girl, you are way 
                         pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your 
                         nipples real brown?

               A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl's jacket 
               and clatters to the floor.

                                     TOUGH GIRL
                         Balls!

               Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It's 
               obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

                                     ROLLO
                         Maybe you're having twins. Maybe 
                         your little boyfriend's got mutant 
                         sperms and he knocked you up twice!

                                     JUNO
                         Silencio! I just drank my weight in 
                         Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

               Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down 
               one of the aisles.

                                     ROLLO
                         Well, you know where the lavatory 
                         is.
                              (calling after her)
                         You pay for that pee stick when you're 
                         done! Don't think it's yours just 
                         because you've marked it with your 
                         urine!

                                     JUNO
                         Jesus, I didn't say it was.

                                     ROLLO
                         Well, it's not. You're not a lion in 
                         a pride!
                              (to himself)
                         These kids, acting like lions with 
                         their unplanned pregnancies and their 
                         Sunny Delights.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY

               In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the 
               commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily 
               tries to use the pregnancy test.

               We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave 
               Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package 
               photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. 
               The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz 
               Lightening Hair Spritz!"

               INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY

               Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the 
               open test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags 
               it indifferently.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, and this too.

               She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

                                     ROLLO
                         So what's the prognosis, Fertile 
                         Myrtle? Minus or plus?

                                     JUNO
                              (examining stick)
                         I don't know. It's not... seasoned 
                         yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that 
                         pink plus sign again. God, it's 
                         unholy.

               She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the 
               results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

                                     ROLLO
                         That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch. This is 
                         one doodle that can't be undid,

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING

               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 
               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 
               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 
               fashion a noose.

               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 
               prairie grass and wild flowers.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Juno's BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned, 
               The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She 
               picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend, 
               LEAH.

               INT. LEAH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that 
               certain girls love to hoard. The PHONE rings.

                                     LEAH
                              (answering phone)
                         Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

                                     JUNO
                         I am a suicide risk.

                                     LEAH
                         Is this Juno?

                                     JUNO
                         No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones 
                         that need collecting?

                                     LEAH
                         Only the one in my pants.

                                     JUNO
                              (in low tones)
                         Dude, I'm pregnant.

                                     LEAH
                         Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you 
                         have a big lunch?

                                     JUNO
                         It's not a food baby. I took three 
                         pregnancy tests today. I am definitely 
                         up the spout.

                                     LEAH
                         How did you even generate enough pee 
                         for three pregnancy tests?

                                     JUNO
                         I drank like ten tons of Sunny 
                         Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. 
                         And you're shockingly cavalier.

                                     LEAH
                         Is this for real? Like for real, for 
                         real?

                                     JUNO
                         Unfortunately, yes.

                                     LEAH
                         Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

                                     JUNO
                         That's the kind of emotion I was 
                         looking for in the first take.

                                     LEAH
                         Well, are you going to go to 
                         Havenbrooke or Women Now for the 
                         abortion? You need a note from your 
                         parents for Havenbrooke.

                                     JUNO
                         I know. Women Now, I guess. The 
                         commercial says they help women now.

                                     LEAH
                         Want me to call for you? I called 
                         for Becky last year.

                                     JUNO
                         Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do 
                         need your help with something very 
                         urgent.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

               Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well 
               manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.

                                     LEAH
                         Heavy lifting can only help you at 
                         this point.

                                     JUNO
                         That is sick, man.

               Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate 
               portrayal of Bleeker's parents.

                                     LEAH
                         So, you were bored? Is that how this 
                         blessed miracle came to be?

                                     JUNO
                         Nah, it was a premeditated act. The 
                         sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

                                     LEAH
                         When did you decide you were going 
                         to do Bleeker?

                                     JUNO
                         Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a 
               teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a 
               POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, 
               reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher 
               obediently.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

                                     LEAH
                         Aha! You love him.

                                     JUNO
                         It's extremely complicated, and I'd 
                         rather not talk about it in my fragile 
                         state.

               She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing 
               her father's LIFTING BELT.

                                     LEAH
                         So, what was it like humping Bleeker's 
                         bony bod?

                                     JUNO
                         It was magnificent, man!

               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               CU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed.

               CU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands.

               CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide.

               INT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

               PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for 
               early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform 
               that reads "DANCING ELK CONDORS." He is eating some kind of 
               microwaved snack gimmick.

               Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting 
               for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the 
               front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe 
               officiously.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey Bleek.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Cool.

                                     JUNO
                         Your shorts are looking especially 
                         gold today.

                                     BLEEKER
                         My mom uses color-safe bleach.

                         Go Carole.
                              (a beat)
                         So, guess what?

                                     BLEEKER
                              (shrugs)
                         I don't know...

                                     JUNO
                         I'm pregnant.

               Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner 
               and leans back comfortably.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I guess so.
                              (fidgeting)
                         What are you going to do?

               The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's 
               house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of 
               warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves. 
               They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         When I see them all running like 
                         that, with their things bouncing 
                         around in their shorts, I always 
                         picture them naked, even if I don't 
                         want to. I have intrusive thoughts 
                         all the time.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - CONTINUED

                                     BLEEKER
                         I'm supposed to be running.

                                     JUNO
                         I know.

               There's an awkward silence.

                                     BLEEKER
                         So, what do you think we should do?

                                     JUNO
                         I thought I might, you know, nip it 
                         in the bud before it gets worse. 
                         Because I heard in health class that 
                         pregnancy often results in an infant.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, typically. That's what happens 
                         when our moms and teachers get 
                         pregnant.

                                     JUNO
                         So that's cool with you, then?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do 
                         what you think is right.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I 
                         know it wasn't your idea.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Whose idea was it?

                                     JUNO
                         I'll see you at school, O.K.?

               She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (to nobody in 
                              particular)
                         Whose idea was it?

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - DAY

               Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a 
               lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a 
               live-action RPG.

                                     NERD
                         You did not! You don't have the armor. 
                         That Orc Armor you bought from the 
                         wizard doesn't have the power level 
                         to parry my hit!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno tries to push through the masses, but the throng of 
               students is thick and unwielding.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

               Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with 
               photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop 
               in his heyday.

               She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip 
               out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she 
               walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

                                     STEVE RENDAZO
                         Hey, your book fell apart!

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah.

                                     STEVE RENDAZO
                         It must have looked at your face. 
                         PWAH!

               He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo 
                         secretly wants me. Jocks like him 
                         always want freaky girls. Girls with 
                         horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear 
                         and Goth makeup. Girls who play the 
                         cello and wear Converse All-Stars 
                         and want to be children's librarians 
                         when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks 
                         eat that shit up.

               We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with 
               mixed feelings.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         They just won't admit it, because 
                         they're supposed to be into perfect 
                         cheerleaders like Leah. Who, 
                         incidentally, is into teachers.

               We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly 
               with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.

                                     LEAH
                              (from a distance)
                         Me too! I love Woody Allen!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY

               STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to 
               maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her 
               bag.

                                     MR. TINKER
                         People! We're doing our photomagnetism 
                         lab today, so find your partner and 
                         break out into fours.

               Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: 
               Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!

               Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab 
               station and unpack their bags in silence.

                                     JUNO
                         Well! Nothing like experimenting.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I did the prep questions for this 
                         lab last night. You can copy my 
                         answers if you need to.

               He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without 
               looking at her.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, I couldn't copy your work.

                                     BLEEKER
                         But you copy my work every week.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab 
                         partner, huh?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't mind. You definitely bring 
                         something to the table.

                                     JUNO

                                     BLEEKER
                         Or something.

               The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at 
               the station.

                         So, who's ready for some 
                         photomagnificence?

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         I have a menstrual migraine, and I 
                         can't look at bright lights today.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Amanda, I told you to go to the 
                         infirmary and lie down. You never 
                         listen.

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         No Josh, I don't take orders. Not 
                         from you and not from any man.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         You know, you've been acting like 
                         this ever since I went up to see my 
                         brother at Mankato. I told you, 
                         nothing happened!

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Something happened. Because your 
                         eyes? Are very cold? They're very 
                         cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         What? My eyes are not lying!

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, 
                         they have been lying eyes.

               Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, 
               fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Okay... I'm going to set up the 
                         apparatus. Juno, want to get a C 
                         clamp out of that drawer?

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         I'm going to the infirmary.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Good. Call me when you're OFF the 
                         rag.

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Fine. Call me when you learn how to 
                         love just one person and not cheat 
                         at your brother's college just because 
                         you had four Smirnoff Ices and a 
                         bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored 
                         Boone's!

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. 
                         I'll make a note of it.

               He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.

                                     JUNO
                         Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor 
                         of Boone's. Right, Bleek?

               Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus. 
               GIRL LAB PARTNER stalks off dramatically.

               Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

               Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a 
               distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged 
               conflict. The ad reads: "Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives 
               women choice. Women's Choice Health Center."

               Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment, 
               she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad, 
               checking herself out in the mirror.

                                     JUNO

                              voice prompt)
                         "Para instruciones en Espanol, oprima 
                         numero dos."

               She presses a few buttons in succession.

                                     JUNO
                         Yes, hello, I need to procure a hasty 
                         abortion?... What was that? I'm sorry, 
                         I'm on my hamburger phone and it's 
                         kind of awkward to talk on. It's 
                         really more of a novelty than a 
                         functional appliance.

               She SMACKS the phone a couple of times.

                                     JUNO
                         Better? Okay, good. Yeah, as I said, 
                         I need an abortion, two... sixteen... 
                         Um, it was approximately two months 
                         and four days ago that I had the 
                         sex. That's a guestimate. Okay, next 
                         Saturday? Great.

               She hangs up the phone.

                         I hate it when adults use the term

                         Bleeker went live that night we did 
                         it. I guess he hadn't done it before, 
                         and that's why he got that look on 
                         his face.

                         Which maneuver, sir? The one in which 
                         I moved an entire living room set 
                         from one lawn to another, or the one 
                         in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce 
                         blue slushie in ten minutes?

                         Juno? Did you happen to barf in my 
                         urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by 
                         the front door, the one I got up in 
                         Stillwater? I found some weird blue

                         on that potato, I'm gonna kick your 
                         monkey ass.

               EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY

               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 
               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 
               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 
               MURDERING."

                                     LONE PROTESTER
                              (chanting in extremely 
                              shy, accented voice)
                         All babies want to get borned! All 
                         babies want to get borned!

               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.

                                     JUNO
                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.

                                     SU-CHIN
                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?

                                     JUNO
                         Good. I'm good.
                              (pause)
                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 
                         class yet?

                                     SU-CHIN
                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 
                         little last night, but I'm having 
                         trouble concentrating.

                                     JUNO
                         You should try Adderall.

                                     SU-CHIN
                         No thanks. I'm off pills.

                                     JUNO
                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 
                         a huge crazy freakout because she 
                         took too many behavioral meds at 
                         once. She took off her clothes and 
                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 
                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 
                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"

                                     SU-CHIN
                         I heard that was you.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, it was nice seeing you.

               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.

                                     SU-CHIN
                              (calling out)
                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 
                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 
                         And it has fingernails.

                                     JUNO
                         Really? Fingernails?

               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY

               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 
               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 
               women, teens and ill-behaved children.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 
                         women are trusted friends. Please 
                         put your hands where I can see them 
                         and surrender any bombs.

               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Your name, please?

                                     JUNO
                         Juno MacGuff.

               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 
               paperwork on a clipboard.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 
                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         I need you to fill these out, both 
                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 
                         details. We need to know about every 
                         score and every sore.

               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 
               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Would you like some free condoms? 
                         They're boysenberry.

                                     JUNO
                         No thank you. I'm off sex.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         My partner uses these every time we 
                         have intercourse. They make his balls 
                         smell like pie.

                                     JUNO
                         Congrats.

               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 
               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 
               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 
               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 
               moments.

               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 
               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 
               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 
               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 
               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 
               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 
               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 
               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?

               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.

               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 
               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 
               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               EXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY

               Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno 
               standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.

                                     LEAH
                         What are you doing here, dumbass? I 
                         thought I was supposed to pick you 
                         up at four.

                                     JUNO
                         I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled 
                         like a dentist in there. They had 
                         these really horrible magazines, 
                         with, like, spritz cookie recipes 
                         and bad fiction and water stains, 
                         like someone read them in the tub. 
                         And the receptionist tried to give 
                         me these weird condoms that looked 
                         like grape suckers, and she told me 
                         about her boyfriend's pie balls, and 
                         Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told 
                         me the baby had fingernails. 
                         Fingernails!

                                     LEAH
                         Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's 
                         claws could scratch your vag on the 
                         way out?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm staying pregnant, Le.

                                     LEAH
                         Keep your voice down dude, my mom's 
                         around here somewhere. She doesn't 
                         know we're sexually active.

                                     JUNO
                         What does that even mean? Anyway, I 
                         got to thinking on the way over. I 
                         was thinking maybe I could give the 
                         baby to somebody who actually likes 
                         that kind of thing. You know, like a 
                         woman with a bum ovary or something. 
                         Or some nice lesbos.

                                     LEAH
                         But then you'll get huge. Your chest 
                         is going to milktate. And you have 
                         to tell everyone you're pregnant.

                                     JUNO
                         I know. Maybe they'll canonize me 
                         for being so selfless.

                                     LEAH
                         Maybe they'll totally shit and be 
                         super mad at you and not let you 
                         graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for 
                         spring break.

                                     JUNO
                         Bleeker and I were going to go to 
                         Gettysburg for spring break.

               Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.

                                     LEAH
                         Well, maybe you could look at one of 
                         those adoption ads. I see them all 
                         the time in the Penny Saver.

                                     JUNO
                         There are ads? For parents?

                                     LEAH
                         Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." 
                         They're right by the ads for like, 
                         iguanas and terriers and used fitness 
                         equipment. It's totally legit.

                                     JUNO
                         Come on, Leah. I can't scope out 
                         wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! 
                         That's tacky. That's like buying 
                         clothes at the Pump n' Munch.

               EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

               Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp 
               giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers.

               Juno has her pipe with her.

                                     JUNO
                         The Penny Saver sucks.

                                     LEAH
                         Yeah, but it sucks for free.

               They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and 
               teeth are Windex-blue.

                                     LEAH
                         Look at this one "Wholesome, 
                         spiritually wealthy couple have found 
                         true love with each other."
                              (checks to see that 
                              Juno is paying 
                              attention)
                         "All that's missing is your bastard."

                                     JUNO
                              (reading a different 
                              page)
                         There's a guy in here who's giving 
                         away a piano. Free for the hauling! 
                         We should put it in Bleeker's yard.

                                     LEAH
                         You're not listening to me.

                                     JUNO
                         No, I heard you. I just can't give 
                         the baby to people who describe 
                         themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking 
                         for something a little edgier.

                                     LEAH
                         What did you have in mind, a family 
                         of disturbed loners who are into 
                         gunplay and incest?

                                     JUNO
                         I was thinking a graphic designer, 
                         mid-thirties, and his cool Asian 
                         wife who dresses awesome and plays 
                         bass. But I'm trying to not be too 
                         particular.

                                     LEAH
                         All right, how about this one? 
                         "Healthy, educated couple seeking 
                         infant to join our family of five. 
                         You will be compensated. Help us 
                         complete the circle of love."

                                     JUNO
                         Yeesh, they sound like a cult. 
                         Besides, they're greedy bitches. 
                         They already have three kids!

                         Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.

               She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno 
               scans the ad silently.

               We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple 
               with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated, 
               successful couple wishes to..."

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, 
                         and they were beautiful even in black 
                         and white.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT

               We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish 
               curtains -- and the light on inside.

               INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening 
               to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.

               He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep 
               yearbook.

               We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white 
               YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 
               message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with 
                         motion lotion. Just kidding (kind 
                         of.) Your best friend, Juno.

               Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE 
               Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.

               There's a knock on the bedroom door.

               BLEEKER'S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Paul? Are you coming downstairs to 
                         eat?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't think so.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I'm not hungry, oddly.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         But it's breakfast for supper. Your 
                         favorite, Paulie. I made French toast 
                         and sausage. Patties, not linkies, 
                         just like you like it.

               Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Juno MacGuff called while you were 
                         out running. She wants to know if 
                         you're coming to her little 
                         coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Thanks for the message.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         You know how I feel about her.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You've mentioned it about fifty times.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         I just hope you don't consider her a 
                         close friend.

               Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.

               We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one 
               hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Bren and MAC are seated on the couch. Leah is standing nearby 
               for reinforcements. Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out 
               how to break the massive news.

                                     JUNO
                         I have no idea how to spit this out.

                                     BREN
                         Hon, did you get expelled?

                                     JUNO
                         No. The school would probably contact 
                         you in the event of my expulsion.

                                     BREN
                         Well, I was just asking. It seemed 
                         plausible.

                                     MAC
                         Do you need a large sum of money? 
                         Legal counsel?

                                     JUNO
                         No, no, I'm definitely not asking 
                         for anything. Except maybe mercy. 
                         Like, it would be really great if 
                         nobody hit me.

                                     MAC
                         What have you done, Junebug? Did you 
                         hit someone with the Previa?

                                     LEAH
                         Best to just tell them, man. Rip off 
                         the Band-Aid and let it bleed.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm pregnant.

               Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

                                     BREN
                         Oh, God...

                                     JUNO
                         But I'm going to give it up for 
                         adoption. I already found the perfect 
                         people.

               Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings.

                                     JUNO
                         They say they're going to pay my 
                         medical expenses and everything. I 
                         promise this will all be resolved in 
                         thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend 
                         it never happened.

                                     MAC
                         You're pregnant?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any 
                         consolation, I have heartburn that's 
                         like, radiating down to my kneecaps 
                         and I haven't gone number two since 
                         Wednesday. Morning!

                                     BREN
                              (interrupting)
                         I didn't even know you were sexually 
                         active!

               Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.

                                     MAC
                         Who is the kid?

                                     JUNO
                         The baby? I don't know anything about 
                         it yet. I only know it's got 
                         fingernails, allegedly.

                                     BREN
                         Nails? Really?

                                     MAC
                         No, I mean the father! Who's the 
                         father, Juno?

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker.

               Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter.

                                     JUNO
                         What?

                                     MAC
                         Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had 
                         it in him!

                                     BREN
                              (giggling)
                         He just doesn't look, well, virile.

                                     LEAH
                         I know, right?

                                     MAC
                         Okay, this is no laughing matter.

                                     JUNO
                              (indignant)
                         No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by 
                         the way. He was very good in... chair.

               Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno.

                                     MAC
                         Did you say you were thinking about 
                         adoption?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, well, there's this couple who've 
                         been trying to have a baby for five 
                         years.

                                     LEAH
                         We found them in the Penny Saver by 
                         the exotic birds section.

               Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to 
               make the situation sound more legitimate.

                                     JUNO
                         But they have a real lawyer and 
                         everything. I'm going to meet with 
                         them next weekend.

                                     BREN
                         Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing 
                         to do. Probably tougher than you can 
                         understand right now.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.

                                     MAC
                         Damn skippy, you're not! You don't 
                         even remember to give Liberty Bell 
                         her breathing meds.

                                     JUNO
                         Once! And she didn't die, if you 
                         recall!

                                     BREN
                         Honey, had you considered, you know, 
                         the alternative?

               Leah and Juno exchange glances.

                                     JUNO
                         No.

                                     BREN
                         Well, you're a brave young lady. 
                         You're made of stronger stuff than I 
                         thought. You're a little Viking!

                                     JUNO
                         Cool it.

                                     BREN
                         First things first, we have to get 
                         you healthy. You need prenatal 
                         vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do 
                         incredible things for your nails, so 
                         that's a plus. Oh, and we need to 
                         schedule a doctor's appointment. 
                         Find out where you're going to 
                         deliver.

                                     JUNO
                         The term "deliver" is so weird. Can 
                         we not say "deliver"?

                                     LEAH
                         How does "crap it out" sound?

                                     MAC
                         Juno, I want to come with you to 
                         meet these adoption people. You're 
                         just a kid. I don't want you to get 
                         ripped off by a couple of babystarved 
                         wingnuts.

                                     JUNO
                         Sure, Dad.

               Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.

                                     MAC
                         I thought you were the kind of girl 
                         who knew when to say when.

                                     JUNO
                         I have no idea what kind of girl I 
                         am.

                                     BREN
                              (sensing tension)
                         Why don't you girls go upstairs for 
                         a while? I think Mac's gonna blow.

               Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs.

                                     MAC
                         Just tell it to me straight, Bren. 
                         Do you think this is my fault? Her 
                         mother's fault?

                                     BREN
                         I think kids get bored and have 
                         intercourse. And I think Junebug was 
                         a dummy about it. But we have to 
                         move on from here and help her figure 
                         it out.

                                     MAC
                         I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

                                     BREN
                         You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. 
                         And Juno's not going to be a ma. 
                         Somebody else is going to find a 
                         precious blessing from Jesus in this 
                         garbage dump of a situation. I 
                         friggin' hope.

                                     MAC
                              (conspiratorially)
                         Did you see it coming when she sat 
                         us down here?

                                     BREN
                         Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she 
                         was expelled or into hard drugs.

                                     MAC
                         That was my first instinct too. Or 
                         D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm 
                         going to punch that Bleeker kid in 
                         the weiner the next time I see him.

                                     BREN
                         Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You 
                         know it wasn't his idea.

               Mac shrugs in agreement.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

               Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS 
               preparing the house for Juno's arrival --

               Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.

               Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings.

               Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture.

               Lining up a shelf of BOOKS.

               EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 
               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 
               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 
               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 
               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.

               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 
               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno 
                         and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.

                                     JUNO
                         Vanessa, right?

                                     MAC
                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 
                         my irresponsible child over to your 
                         home.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can I take your coats?

                                     JUNO
                         Sure.

               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 
               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.

                                     JUNO
                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 
                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 
                         other people with the fake woods in 
                         the background. Like I'm really going 
                         to fall for that, you know?

                                     VANESSA
                         You found us in the Penny Saver?

               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 
               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 
               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.

                                     MARK
                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious 
               living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch 
               with a briefcase in her lap.

                                     MARK
                         This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.

                                     JUNO
                              (in exaggerated, 
                              growling German accent)
                         Geeeerta Rauuuss!

                                     GERTA
                              (straight)
                         Nice to meet you.

               Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily.

                                     MAC
                         I'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course, 
                         is my daughter Juno.

                                     MARK
                         Like the city in Alaska?

                                     JUNO
                         No.

                                     MARK
                         Cool. Well, let's sit down and get 
                         to know each other a bit.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll get drinks. What would everyone 
                         like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin 
                         Water...

                                     JUNO
                         A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

                                     MAC
                         She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful 
                         sense of humor, which is just one of 
                         her many genetic gifts.

                                     JUNO
                         I also have good teeth. No cavities. 
                         We finally got fluoridated water in 
                         Dancing Elk.

               She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.

               Vanessa stares, unflappable.

                                     MAC
                         We're fine, thank you.

               Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch.

                                     GERTA
                         So, Juno. First off, how far along 
                         are you?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm a junior.

                                     GERTA
                         No, I mean in your pregnancy.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the 
                         doctor yesterday and they said I was 
                         twelve weeks.

               Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost 
                         into your second trimester, then?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on 
                         May 4.

                                     VANESSA
                         The tough part's almost over for 
                         you. I mean, my girlfriends always 
                         tell me the first couple months are 
                         the hardest.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm 
                         more worried about the part where I 
                         have to start wearing jeans with an 
                         elastic panel in the front.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think pregnancy is beautiful.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, you're lucky it's not you.

               Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     MARK
                              (clearing throat)
                         So, let's discuss how we're gonna do 
                         this... thing.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, I just have the baby and give 
                         it to you, right?

                                     GERTA
                         Mark and Vanessa are willing to 
                         negotiate an open adoption.

                                     MAC
                              (protective)
                         Wait. What does that mean?

                                     GERTA
                         It means they'd send annual updates, 
                         photos, let Juno know how the baby 
                         is doing as he or she grows up. Of 
                         course, Juno's legal rights would be 
                         terminated...

                                     JUNO
                         Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. 
                         I don't need to be notified of 
                         anything. Can't we just kick it old 
                         school? I could just put the baby in 
                         a basket and send it your way. You 
                         know, like Moses in the reeds.

                                     MARK
                         Technically, that would be kickin' 
                         it Old Testament.

               Mark and Juno lock eyes.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to 
                         do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping 
                         off a Band-Aid.

                                     GERTA
                         Well, then we agree a traditional 
                         closed adoption would be best for 
                         all involved, then?

                                     JUNO
                         Shit, yeah. Close it up.

               Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.

                                     MARK
                         Obviously, we'll compensate you for 
                         your medical expenses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Are you looking for any other 
                         compensation?

                                     MAC
                         Excuse me?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, no... I'm not going to sell 
                         the baby. I just want it to grow up 
                         with people who are ready to love it 
                         and be parents. I'm in high school, 
                         dude. I'm ill-equipped.

                                     VANESSA
                         You're doing an amazing and selfless 
                         thing for us.

                                     MARK
                         Vanessa has wanted a baby since we 
                         got married.

                                     VANESSA
                         I want to be a mommy so badly!

               Juno and Mac stare at her.

                                     MAC
                         You don't say.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, haven't you ever felt like you 
                         were born to do something?

                                     MAC
                         Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, I was born to be a mother. 
                         Some of us are.

                                     JUNO
                         Mark, are you looking forward to 
                         being a dad?

               Mark is caught off guard.

                                     MARK
                         Sure, why not? I mean, every guy 
                         wants to be a father. Coach soccer, 
                         help with science projects and... I 
                         don't know. Fatherly stuff.

               Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, shall we start looking over 
                         the paperwork? Gerta has already 
                         drafted some preliminary documents.

                                     JUNO
                         Can I use the facilities first? Being 
                         pregnant makes you pee like 
                         Seabiscuit.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure. The powder room down here is 
                         being re-tiled, but you can use the 
                         master bath upstairs. Go up, then 
                         turn left and on your right...

                                     JUNO
                         Room with a toilet, got it.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY/STAIRS - DAY

               Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed 
               photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is 
               beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

               The Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the 
               double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet 
               and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume 
               and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a 
               crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up, 
               fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs 
               it through her hair like pomade.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark.

                                     JUNO
                         Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to 
                         see you up here.

                                     MARK
                         Sorry. I was just getting something.

                                     JUNO
                         Did your wife send you up here to 
                         spy on me?

                                     MARK
                         What? No! Do we come off like paranoid 
                         yuppies or something?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, you don't just invite a random 
                         pregnant teenager into your house 
                         and leave her unsupervised. I could 
                         be a total klepto, for all you know.

                                     MARK
                         I don't get a klepto vibe from you. 
                         Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't 
                         rule it out.

                                     JUNO
                         I did steal a squirt of perfume. 
                         What do you think? It's Clinique 
                         Happy.

               She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils.

                                     JUNO
                         Smell those sparkling topnotes!

               Mark inhales.

                                     MARK
                         Am I supposed to feel happy now?

                                     JUNO
                         You should be happy, Holmes. I'm 
                         giving you and Vanessa the gift of 
                         life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! 
                         And you don't even have to be there 
                         when the baby comes out of me all 
                         covered in...

                                     MARK
                         Viscera?

                                     JUNO
                         Blood and guts.

                                     MARK
                         We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.

               Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently.

                                     JUNO
                              (halting)
                         Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul?

               Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We 
               see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.

                                     MARK
                         Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa 
                         lets me have a room for all my old 
                         stuff.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, you get a whole room in your 
                         own house? She's got you on a long 
                         leash there, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Shut up.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL" ROOM - DAY

               The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt 
               rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes 
               his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno.

                                     JUNO
                         It's beautiful. I've always liked 
                         Gibson better than Fender.

                                     MARK
                         What do you play?

                                     JUNO
                         I rock a Harmony.

                                     MARK
                              (holding back a chuckle)
                         Oh.

                                     JUNO
                         What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.

                                     MARK
                         Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.

               Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.

                                     JUNO
                         What is that, Mahogany? What happens 
                         if you crack the neck?

                                     MARK
                         Tell me about it. I used to play in 
                         a really tight band back when I lived 
                         in Chicago, and one night we opened 
                         for the Melvins... do you know who 
                         the Melvins are?

                                     JUNO
                              (lying)
                         Yeah.

                                     MARK
                         Well, we were playing with them and 
                         I busted this guitar onstage. It 
                         cost me $800 and a dime bag just to 
                         have it fixed.

                                     JUNO
                         When was this, like '96?

                                     MARK
                         '93. I'm telling you that was the 
                         best time for rock and roll.

                                     JUNO
                         Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You 
                         weren't there, so you can't understand 
                         the magic.

                                     MARK
                         You weren't even alive!

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence 
               for Juno and Mark to return. Mac notices a brand new PILATES 
               MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

                                     MAC
                         So. What's that thing?

                                     VANESSA
                         A Pilates machine?

                                     MAC
                         What do you make with that?

                                     VANESSA
                         You don't make anything. It's for 
                         exercising.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - SAME

               Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged. They 
               play little riffs. He teaches her a couple chords.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

                                     MAC
                         My wife just ordered one of those 
                         Tony Little Gazelles off the TV, you 
                         know, from the guy with the ponytail?

               Vanessa and Gerta have no response.

                                     MAC
                         That guy just doesn't look right to 
                         me.

               Suddenly, a shriek of AMP FEEDBACK, followed by loud, 
               discordant GUITAR STRUMMING can be heard drifting down from 
               upstairs. Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to her guests)
                         Will you excuse me?

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

               Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing. 
               "Doll Parts" by Hole.

                                     JUNO AND MARK
                              (quietly singing 
                              together)
                         "Yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... they really do."

               Building together.

                                     JUNO AND MARK
                              (singing together and 
                              connecting)
                         Yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... and I do to.
                              (both blush)

               VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down 
               the guitar. Mark doesn't notice her immediately.

                                     MARK
                              (passionate singing)
                         I WANT TO BE THE...
                              (notices Vanessa)
                         Oh, sorry honey...

               Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.

                                     VANESSA
                         You guys are playing music?

                                     MARK
                         Juno just wanted a closer look at 
                         Kimber here.

                                     JUNO
                         Your guitar is named Kimber?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah.

                                     JUNO
                         That's all right. My axe is named 
                         Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. 
                         Franklin was the hot one with the 
                         polio.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think Gerta is waiting for us 
                         downstairs with some important stuff 
                         for us to go over.

               Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. He and Juno exit 
               the room, chastised. Vanessa looks to Mark in question.

                                     VANESSA
                         Didn't mean to interrupt the jam 
                         sessions.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

               Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process 
               of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark 
               trail behind.

                                     GERTA
                         So, look those over and give me a 
                         call at my office if you have any 
                         questions.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno, we'd really appreciate it if 
                         you could keep us updated on any 
                         doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, 
                         other things of that nature.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to 
                         know how your kid is cooking.

                                     VANESSA
                         So, then, you really think you're 
                         going to go ahead with this?

               Mac STARES at Juno gravely.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. For sure. I like you guys.

               Juno looks at Mark.

                                     VANESSA
                         How sure? Percentage-wise, would you 
                         say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

               Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh really?

                                     JUNO
                         Look, if I could give it to you now, 
                         I would. But it probably looks like 
                         a Sea Monkey at this point, so I 
                         think we should leave it in there 
                         for a while until it gets cuter, you 
                         know?

                                     MAC
                         I think that's a great idea.

                                     MARK
                         That's great, right? Stellar news. 
                         Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll 
                         hear from you soon, all right?

                                     MAC
                         All right, take care of yourselves.

               Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the 
               foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps 
               her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.

                                     GERTA
                              (overly aggressive)
                         All RIGHT!

               Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

               It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving 
               tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

               Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are 
               icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside 
               him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker.

                                     VIJAY
                         Hey man.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Oh, hey Vijay.

                                     VIJAY
                         Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         Just like our moms and teachers!

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         Did you hear it's yours?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         What a trip, man.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't really know anything about 
                         it.

                                     VIJAY
                         You should grow a moustache. You're 
                         a real man now.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I can't grow a moustache. It never 
                         comes in evenly.

                                     VIJAY
                         Me neither. But I'm going to stop 
                         wearing underpants in order to raise 
                         my sperm count. See you.

               VIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HEAD OFFICE - DAY

               We're looking over Juno's now FIVE MONTH PREGNANT BELLY to a 
               school administrator filling out a slip.

               Juno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way 
               out.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey Juno... A couple of us are going 
                         to the cineplex after school to donut 
                         that movie with the guy with eighteen 
                         kids.

                                     JUNO
                         Sorry, Bleek... Going for my 
                         ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Okay, cool.

                                     JUNO
                         I'll try to drop by later.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

               SPLOOGE! We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's 
               exposed pregnant belly. An ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN is using a 
               Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump. 
               Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image.

               The tech takes measurements and types them into her database.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         That's the feet...

                                     ALL THREE
                         Oooh...

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         And there's a hand...

               The monitor reveals the baby's head.

                                     ALL THREE
                              (various)
                         Check that out... No way...

                                     BREN
                              (dreamily)
                         Would you look at that?

                                     LEAH
                         Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is 
                         scary!

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've 
                         got in your belly is Taco Bell!

                                     LEAH
                         Touche.

                                     JUNO
                              (gazing at the monitor)
                         It is really weird looking. It's 
                         like it's not even real. I can't 
                         believe there are saps who actually 
                         cry at these things.

               Juno and Leah look at BREN, who is dabbing her eyes 
               discreetly.

                                     BREN
                         What? I'm not made of stone.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Well, there we have it. Would you 
                         like to know the sex?

                                     LEAH
                         Aw, please Junebug?

                                     JUNO
                         No way. No, I definitely don't want 
                         to know.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Planning to be surprised when you 
                         deliver?

                                     JUNO
                         I want Mark and Vanessa to be 
                         surprised, and if I know, I won't be 
                         able to keep myself from telling 
                         them and ruining the whole thing.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                              (condescending)
                         Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at 
                         school?

                                     JUNO
                         No, they're the people who are 
                         adopting the baby.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

                                     BREN
                         Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         I just see a lot of teenage mothers 
                         come through here. It's obviously a 
                         poisonous environment for a baby to 
                         be raised in.

               Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.

                                     JUNO
                         How do you know I'm so poisonous? 
                         Like, what if the adoptive parents 
                         turn out to be evil molesters?

                                     LEAH
                         Or stage parents!

                                     BREN
                         They could be utterly negligent. 
                         Maybe they'll do a far shittier job 
                         of raising a kid than my dumbass 
                         stepdaughter ever would. Have you 
                         considered that?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         No... I guess not.

                                     BREN
                         What is your job title, exactly?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Excuse me?

                                     BREN
                         I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

                                     BREN
                         Well I'm a nail technician, and I 
                         think we both ought to stick to what 
                         we know.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BREN
                         You think you're special because you 
                         get to play Picture Pages up there?

               Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR.

                                     BREN
                         My five year-old daughter could do 
                         that, and let me tell you, she is 
                         not the brightest bulb in the tanning 
                         bed. So why don't you go back to 
                         night school in Manteno and learn a 
                         real trade!

               The ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff.

                                     JUNO
                         Bren, you're a dick! I love it.

               INT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT.

               EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON

               The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's 
               exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial 
               Valley."

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON

               Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.

               MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

                                     MARK
                         Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see 
                         you here.

                                     JUNO
                         I've got something really cool to 
                         show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

                                     MARK
                         No, she's working late tonight. She's 
                         trying to accrue some extra time off 
                         for when, you know...

               He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly.

                                     JUNO
                         Right. I hear they can be kind of a 
                         time-suck.

                                     MARK
                         Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?

                                     JUNO
                         Sure. What is it with you rich people 
                         and your herb-infused juices?

                                     MARK
                         I don't know. Something to do with 
                         the four-packs...
                              (adding)
                         ...They're not bad.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks.

                         Why aren't you at work?

                         you? What would the Melvins say?

                         They'd say you came a long way out

                         Come on, you're going to want to sit 
                         down for this.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

               As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions 
               for Mark to join her on the couch.

                                     JUNO
                         Park it, dude.

               Mark sits down. With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark, 
               glossy sheet from the envelope. It's her ULTRASOUND.

                                     JUNO
                         Behold, good sir! The very first 
                         photo of your future child.

                         You're kidding!

               Mark EXAMINES the ultrasound, baffled.

                                     JUNO
                         I think it kind of looks like my 
                         friend, Paulie.

                                     MARK
                              (joking)
                         Oh, is he bald and amorphous?

                         No, he's the dad.

               Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered 
               that her baby might have a father. He stands up and holds 
               the photo up to the light critically.

                                     MARK
                         Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

                                     JUNO
                         The doctor can tell, but I decided 
                         not to know. I want it to be a big 
                         surprise.

                                     MARK
                         Well, it can really only go two ways.

                                     JUNO
                         That's what you think. I drink tons 
                         of booze so you might get one of 
                         those scary neuter-babies that's 
                         born without junk.

                         We definitely want it to have junk.

                         Well don't worry about it. My stepmom 
                         is forcing me to eat really healthy. 
                         She won't even let me stand in front 
                         of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. 
                         Hope you're ready.

               Mark chuckles.

                                     MARK
                         Wait...do you hear that?

               A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and 
               walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source 
               of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.

                                     JUNO
                         What is it?

                         It's only my favorite song. It's 
                         Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the 
                         Carpenters.

                         I've heard the Carpenters before. 
                         Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not 
                         unlike the White Stripes.

                                     MARK
                         You haven't heard the Carpenters 
                         like this. Listen.

               Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and 
               turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence 
               in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics.

                                     MARK

                         Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll 
                         rip a copy for you before you leave.

                                     JUNO
                         You don't have to do that.

                         It's the least I can do. What did 
                         you say your favorite band was?

                                     JUNO
                         I didn't. But it's a three-way tie 
                         between the Stooges, Patti Smith and 
                         the Runaways.

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, I definitely need to make you 
                         some CDs. At least while my kid is 
                         hanging out in there.

               He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch.

               Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling 
               CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" 
               charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone.

               Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up.

                                     JUNO
                              (reading title)
                         The Wizard of Gore?

                                     MARK
                              (distracted)
                         Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. 
                         He's the ultimate master of horror.

                                     JUNO
                         Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate 
                         master of horror.

               Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised.

                                     MARK
                         Argento's good, but Lewis is 
                         completely demented. We're talking 
                         buckets of goo. Red corn syrup 
                         everywhere. And fake brains up the 
                         yin-yang.

                                     JUNO

                              box)
                         Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.

               Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?"

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

               We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard 
               of Gore.

               Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer 
               floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.

                                     JUNO
                              (watching movie)
                         This is even better than Suspiria. 
                         You've got decent taste in slasher 
                         movies, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Here's to dovetailing interests.

               He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly.

                                     JUNO
                         So, have you and Vanessa thought of 
                         a name for the baby yet?

                                     MARK
                         Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison 
                         for a girl.

                         Madison? Isn't that kind of... I 
                         don't know, gay?

                                     MARK
                         God, pretentious much? I guess 
                         everyone should have a mysterious 
                         name like Juno, huh?

                                     JUNO
                         My dad went through this phase where 
                         he was obsessed with Greek and Roman 
                         mythology. He named me after Zeus's 
                         wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, 
                         but I'm pretty sure Juno was his 
                         only wife. She was supposed to be 
                         really beautiful but really mean. 
                         Like Diana Ross.

                         That suits you.

                                     MARK
                         You know, not many teenage girls in 
                         your situation would actually go 
                         through with this.

                                     JUNO
                         I weighed my options. But after all 
                         this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, 
                         get rid of it. I want to have it. 
                         For you guys.

                                     MARK
                         You're something else.

               A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa's home.

                                     MARK
                         Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of 
                         here.

                                     JUNO
                         Why? What the big deal?

                                     MARK
                         Nothing. She just hates when I sit 
                         around watching movies and 'not 
                         contributing.'

                                     JUNO
                         I'll handle this. I'm really good at 
                         diffusing mom-type rage.

               Juno jumps up and rushes out.

                                     MARK
                         Wait... aww, crap!

               INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures 
               into the living room. She's struggling to carry some oversized 
               shopping bags.

                                     VANESSA
                         Mark? Are you home? I want to show 
                         you some things I picked up.

               Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND 
               photo. Mark trails behind her.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi Vanessa!

               Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno! God, you startled me. What are 
                         you doing here? What's wrong?

                                     JUNO
                         Nothing...

                                     VANESSA
                         Then what's going on?

                                     JUNO
                         I went to the doctor today.

               Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. 
               Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.

                                     VANESSA
                         Is the baby okay?

                                     JUNO
                         Sure. It's the right size and 
                         everything. I even saw its phalanges 
                         today! Check this...

               She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her 
               arm around her.

                                     VANESSA
                         What...

                                     JUNO
                         This is the baby. Your baby.

               Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JUNO
                              (kindly)
                         Doesn't it look like it's waving? 
                         It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, 
                         Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

                                     VANESSA
                         Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

                                     MARK
                         Juno was nice enough to bring this 
                         by for us.

                                     JUNO
                         I came over as soon as I got that 
                         cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. 
                         My stepmom verbally abused the 
                         ultrasound tech so we were escorted 
                         off the premises.

                                     VANESSA
                              (distracted)
                         Oh, that's great!

               She can't divert her gaze from the photo.

                                     JUNO
                         See? Nothing to worry about.

               Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of 
               emotion.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY

               Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping 
               bags from various kids stores.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, what kind of swag did you score?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah. Mall madness, huh?

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. 
                         For, you know, the baby. Babies need 
                         a lot of things. I want everything 
                         to be just right.

                                     JUNO
                         I thought people got all that stuff 
                         at baby showers. When my stepmom had 
                         my sister I remember she got about a 
                         million presents. They were all lame 
                         though, so I wasn't jealous.

                                     MARK
                         I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.

                                     JUNO
                         Why?

                                     VANESSA
                         Um, I think people are kind of unsure 
                         about the situation because it's 
                         not, you know, set in stone.

                                     JUNO
                         What do you mean? You mean...
                              (aghast)
                         Do you think I'm going to flake out 
                         on you?

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, I don't think that, Juno. 
                         It's just that, we went through a 
                         situation before where it didn't 
                         work out.

               Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks 
               embarrassed.

                                     MARK
                         Cold feet.

                                     JUNO
                         You should have gone to China. I 
                         heard they give away babies like 
                         free iPods. They shoot 'em out of 
                         those T-shirt guns at sports events.

                                     VANESSA
                              (abruptly)
                         Right. Well, Juno, your parents must 
                         be wondering where you are. You might 
                         want to head home.

                                     JUNO
                         Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they 
                         figure nothing worse could happen to 
                         me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was 
                         nice seeing you guys again.

               She waves and heads for the door.

                                     MARK
                              (to Juno)
                         Hey, don't forget your bag.

               Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an 
               issue of Dog Fancy.

               Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.

                                     BREN
                         Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

                                     JUNO
                         I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark 
                         and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I 
                         wound up staying for a couple of 
                         hours.

                                     BREN
                         A couple of hours? Why are you going 
                         up there in the first place?

                                     JUNO
                         They said they wanted to know about 
                         this stuff. They said to keep them 
                         updated, so I did!

                                     BREN
                         You could have sent it to them. Why 
                         would you drive an hour out to East 
                         Jesus, Nowhere?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know, I just did. And while 
                         we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark 
                         and I watched The Wizard of Gore and 
                         he burned me some CDs of weird music. 
                         He's kind of cool.

               A beat as Bren absorbs this.

                                     BREN
                         That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a 
                         married stranger. You overstepped a 
                         boundary.

                                     JUNO
                         Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're 
                         the one overstepping boundaries. 
                         You're acting like you're the one 
                         who has to go through this and get 
                         huge and push a baby out of your vag 
                         for someone else. Besides, who cares 
                         if he's married? I can have friends 
                         who are married.

                                     BREN
                         It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You 
                         don't know squat about the dynamics 
                         of marriage.

                                     JUNO
                         You don't know anything about me!

                                     BREN
                         I know enough.

               Bren rises to leave, clutching the Dog Fancy magazine.

                                     JUNO
                              (gesturing to the 
                              magazine)
                         We don't even have a dog!

                                     BREN
                         Yeah, because you're allergic to 
                         their saliva. I've made a lot of 
                         sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a 
                         couple years you're going to move 
                         out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, dream big!

                                     BREN
                         Oh, go fly a kite.

               Bren STORMS out. Juno heads to the URN by the door and 
               defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the 
               house and rings the doorbell.

               BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down 
               to Juno's middle.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive 
                         once. But now she looks a hobbit. 
                         The fat one that was in The Goonies.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Hi Juno. What can I do for you?

                                     JUNO
                         I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in 
                         school today. I'm pretty sure he 
                         needs them back, or his grade could 
                         plummet to an A minus.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Fine. Come in.

               She steals another glance at Juno's belly.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down 
               the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to 
               charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her 
               from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely 
               awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

               Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's 
               bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration 
               hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like 
               something a 5-year old might have.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying 
               like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the 
               bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man. 
                         I think I smell hair burning.

               Bleeker smiles faintly.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Ten minutes.

               She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes 
               and pulls the door shut entirely.

                                     BLEEKER
                         What's up?

                                     JUNO
                         I just wanted to come over. You know, 
                         say hi. I miss hanging out with you 
                         on school nights.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I miss it too.

               He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and 
               pours them into his mouth.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one 
                         and only vice. When we made out, the 
                         day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted 
                         really tangy and delicious.

               CU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed.

                                     BLEEKER
                         So, it looks like you're getting 
                         pregnant-er these days.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private 
                         adoption thing. These married people 
                         in Saint Cloud are going to be the 
                         parents.

               Bleeker is visibly relieved.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Really? What are they like?

                                     JUNO
                         The guy is super cool! His name is 
                         Mark and he's into old horror movies 
                         and he plays guitar. I actually hung 
                         out with him today.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Is that normal?

                                     JUNO
                         I asked my dad and Bren not to narc 
                         us out to your folks, so we should 
                         be safe.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Oh. That's a relief.

               Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm going to really start looking 
                         like a dork soon. Will you still 
                         think I'm cute if I'm huge?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I always think you're cute. I think 
                         you're beautiful.

               Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

                                     JUNO
                         Jesus, Bleek.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, I do.

               The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the 
               song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from 
               the infamous night in the basement.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey Junebug, when all this is over 
                         we should get the band back together 
                         again.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new 
                         drumhead we should be good to go.

                                     BLEEKER
                         We could get back together too.

                                     JUNO
                         Were we together?

               Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, we were once. You know, that 
                         time.

                                     JUNO
                         What about Katrina De Voort? You 
                         could go out with Katrina De Voort.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't like Katrina.

                                     JUNO
                         I totally heard you did.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't. Katrina smells like soup. 
                         Her whole house smells of soup.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

               The house is covered in fresh snow.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls 
               are primed slate gray. A single ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR sits 
               in the corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint 
               samples up near the wall.

                                     VANESSA
                         What do you think? Custard or 
                         Cheesecake?

                                     MARK
                         They're yellow.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, I wanted to pick something 
                         gender-neutral for now. Once we get 
                         the baby, God willing, we can create 
                         a more decisive palette.

                                     MARK
                         Why do people think yellow is gender-
                         neutral? I don't know one man with a 
                         yellow bedroom.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think I'm leaning toward Custard 
                         in this light. I don't know. I should 
                         paint a small area...

                                     MARK
                         Or you could just wait a couple 
                         months. It's not like the baby's 
                         going to storm in here any second 
                         and demand dessert-colored walls.

                                     VANESSA
                         What to Expect says that readying 
                         the baby's room is an important 
                         process for women. It's called 
                         "nesting."

                                     MARK
                         Nesting, huh? Are you planning to 
                         build the crib out of twigs and 
                         saliva?

                                     VANESSA
                         You should read the book. I even 
                         flagged the "daddy chapters" for 
                         you.

                                     MARK
                         I just think it's too early to paint. 
                         That's my opinion.

                                     VANESSA
                         And I disagree.

               Mark shrugs, resigned.

               Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.

                                     VANESSA
                         That wall is going to need something. 
                         Maybe we could put our first family 
                         picture there.

                                     MARK
                         Hm.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can you see it?

               Mark stares at the wall, looking lost.

               INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY

               Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. 
               Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of 
               actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

                                     LEAH
                         Yum. This pretzel tastes like a 
                         friggin' donut!

                                     JUNO
                         Share the love, Tits!

               She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them, 
               appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson.

                                     JUNO
                              (to eavesdroppers)
                         She's assaulting me! She's denying 
                         me fresh-baked goodness!

               Leah claps a hand over Juno's mouth.

                                     JUNO
                              (muffled)
                         Hly shht!

                                     LEAH
                         What?

               Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind 
               it. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their 
               children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a 
               toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is 
               VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.

                                     JUNO
                              (hushed)
                         That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

                                     LEAH
                         Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

               Juno nods.

                                     LEAH
                         No way! She's pretty.

                                     JUNO
                         You sound shocked or something.

                                     LEAH
                         I just thought she'd look really old 
                         in real life.

               The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly 
               discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         And I was like, "No offense, sweetie, 
                         but nobody looks good in gauchos."

                                     WOMAN #2
                         Especially not with her build.

                                     JUNO
                              (mimicking the women, 
                              Peanuts-style)
                         Wah-wah-waaah!

               One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. 
               Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play 
               area and begins to play energetically with her.

               Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers.

                                     LEAH
                         She's gonna steal that kid for her 
                         collection.

                                     JUNO
                         Right, seriously.

               They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids 
               wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore 
               them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.

                                     LEAH
                         Bo-ring!

               Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment.

               INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER

               Leah and Juno approach the elevator.

                                     JUNO
                         I want a huge cookie. And like, a 
                         lamb kebob. Simultaneously.

                                     LEAH
                         God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

               The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno?

               Juno tries her best to look enthused.

                                     JUNO
                         Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to 
                         the mall today?

                                     VANESSA
                         Just, you know, shopping with my 
                         girlfriends.

                                     LEAH
                         You're gay?

               Juno glares at Leah.

                                     VANESSA
                              (confused)
                         No...

                                     JUNO
                         Please excuse Leah. She's mentally 
                         challenged.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?

                                     JUNO
                         Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. 
                         I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button 
                         now!

               She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's great.

               Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.

                                     JUNO
                         Dude, it's moshing all over.

               Vanessa looks confused.

                                     JUNO
                              (explains)
                         It's kicking.

               Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the 
               courage for an unusual request.

                                     VANESSA
                         Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?

                                     JUNO
                         Are you kidding? Everyone at school 
                         is always grabbing at my belly. I'm 
                         like a legend. They call me the 
                         Cautionary Whale.

               She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach.

                                     VANESSA
                         I can't feel anything.

               Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not moving for me.

               She says this as though it's an admission of failure.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, you should try talking to it. 
                         They can apparently hear speech in 
                         there, even though it sounds all ten 
                         thousands leagues under the sea.

               Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hi. Hi, baby. It's me. My name is 
                         Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you.

               Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can you hear me sweet angel?

               Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Then suddenly,

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!

                                     JUNO
                              (nods)
                         Elbow.

                                     VANESSA
                         Wow! It's magical.

               Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

               The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is 
               instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the 
               Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN'S DESK - DAY

               Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans. 
               Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic 
               waistband.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               We're behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the 
               students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL ROOM" - DAY

               Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards 
               of an awful commercial.

               CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid 
               eating a new breakfast product called -- BRUNCH BOWLZ.

               Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...

                                     MARK
                         IF YOU'RE TIRED OF BREAKFAST 
                         BUT NOT HUNGRY FOR LUNCH, 
                         MICROWAVE YOURSELF 
                         A HEALTHY BOWL OF BRUNCH!

               Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings.

                                     MARK
                              (picks up)
                         Hello?

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

                                     JUNO
                         So, I've been spending a lot of time 
                         listening to that weird CD you made 
                         me.

               Mark instantly smiles.

                                     MARK
                         Oh really? What's the verdict?

                                     JUNO
                         I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

                                     MARK
                         Cute?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, when you're used to the raw 
                         power of Iggy and the Stooges, 
                         everything else sounds kind of 
                         precious by comparison.

                                     MARK
                         I imagine you have a collection of 
                         punk chestnuts to prove your point.

                                     JUNO
                         Consider it your musical education.

                                     MARK
                         I'm dying to see what you've got to 
                         teach me.

                                     JUNO
                         Okay, stop surfing porn and get back 
                         to work. Just wanted to say hi.

                                     MARK
                         Go learn something.

               Mark hangs up. Smiles.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

               CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of 
               pregnant food.

               Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table.

                                     LEAH
                         God, you're getting huge. How many 
                         months has it been now?

                                     JUNO
                         Almost eight. You wouldn't believe 
                         how weird I look naked.

                                     LEAH
                         I wish my funbags would get bigger.

                                     JUNO
                         Trust me, you don't. I actually have 
                         to wear a bra now. And I have to rub 
                         this nasty cocoa butter stuff all 
                         over myself or my skin could get 
                         stretched too far and explode.

                                     LEAH
                         Hot!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on 
               the wall, eating their lunch.

               Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help 
               but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused.

                                     JUNO
                         God, why is everyone always staring 
                         at me?

                                     LEAH
                         Well, you are kind of... convex.

               She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, someone's been actually doing 
                         her geometry homework for once!

                                     LEAH
                         I don't have a choice. Keith's been 
                         grading me really hard lately.

                                     JUNO
                         Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers 
                         as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is 
                         already heightened these days.

                                     LEAH
                         Keith's hot.

                                     JUNO
                         Eww, he's all beardy!

               We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the 
               background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of 
               coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.

               BACK ON JUNO AND LEAH:

                                     LEAH
                         Did you hear Bleek is going to prom 
                         with Katrina De Voort?

                                     JUNO
                         Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't 
                         like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

                                     LEAH
                              (shrugging)
                         He asked her. I heard they were going 
                         to Benihana, then the prom, then to 
                         Vijay's parents' cabin.

                                     JUNO
                         Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house 
                         reeks of soup!

                                     LEAH
                         Oh, it totally does. I was there for 
                         her birthday about four years ago 
                         and it was like Lipton Landing. But 
                         you know, boys have endured worse 
                         things for nookie.

                                     JUNO
                         There's no way in hell they're having 
                         sex or even holding hands.

                                     LEAH
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that. He 
                         did it with you. He's a man now.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're 
                         best friends.

                                     LEAH
                         Are you jealous? I thought you said 
                         you didn't care what he did.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I 
                         just know he doesn't like Katrina 
                         and I don't think he should toy with 
                         her emotions like that. She seems so 
                         nice and all.

                                     LEAH
                         Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.

                                     JUNO
                         Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once 
                         you're old enough to go, it's not 
                         cool anymore.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - BLEEKER'S LOCKER - DAY

               Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno marches 
               up to him, belly leading the way.

                                     JUNO
                         Are you honestly and truly going to 
                         prom with Katrina De Voort?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Um, hi?

                                     JUNO
                         Leah just told me you were going 
                         with her.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to 
                         go. A bunch of us from the team are 
                         going to Benihana, then the prom, 
                         then Vijay's parents' cabin.

               Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (meekly)
                         We're getting a stretch limo.

                                     JUNO
                         Your mom must be really glad you're 
                         not taking me.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're mad. Why are you mad?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great 
                         mood. Despite the fact that I'm 
                         trapped in a fat suit I can't take 
                         off, despite the fact that everyone 
                         is making fun of me behind my back, 
                         despite the fact that your little 
                         girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in 
                         art class yesterday...

                                     BLEEKER
                         Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I 
                         doubt she was actually giving you 
                         the stinkeye. She just looks like 
                         that all the time.

               A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look 
               aimed squarely at Juno.

                                     JUNO
                         Whatever. Have fun at the prom with 
                         Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of 
                         something way more cool to do that 
                         night. Like I could pumice my feet, 
                         or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, 
                         or get hit by a ten-ton truck full 
                         of hot garbage juice. All those things 
                         would be exponentially cooler than 
                         going to the prom with you.

               She starts to walk away.

               Bleeker takes a deep breath.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're being really immature.

                              (turning around)
                         What?

               Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.

                                     JUNO
                         That's not how our thing works! I 
                         hurl the accusations and you talk me 
                         down, remember?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Not this time. You don't have any 
                         reason to be mad at me. You broke my 
                         heart. I should be royally ticked at 
                         you, man. I should be really cheesed 
                         off. I shouldn't want to talk to you 
                         anymore.

                                     JUNO
                         Why? Because I got bored and had sex 
                         with you one day, and then I didn't, 
                         like, marry you?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Like I'd marry you! You would be the 
                         meanest wife of all time. And anyway, 
                         I know you weren't bored that day 
                         because there was a lot of stuff on 
                         TV. The Blair Witch Project was on 
                         Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I 
                         want to watch this, but we should 
                         make out instead. La la la."

                                     JUNO
                         Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the 
                         Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure 
                         you guys will have a really bitchin' 
                         time!

                                     BLEEKER
                              (searching for a 
                              comeback)
                         Yeah, well... I still have your 
                         underwear.

                                     JUNO
                         I still have your virginity!

                                     BLEEKER
                              (looking around, 
                              panicked)
                         Oh my God, SHUT UP!

                                     JUNO
                         What? Are you ashamed that we did 
                         it?

                                     BLEEKER
                         No...

                                     JUNO
                         Well at least you don't have to walk 
                         around with the evidence under your 
                         sweater. I'm a planet!

               Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her 
               shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...

                                     BLEEKER
                         Wait, let me take that.

                                     JUNO
                         Huh?

                                     BLEEKER
                         You shouldn't be carrying that heavy 
                         bag. I'll take it.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. It's fine. What's another ten 
                         pounds?

               She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no 
               one sees) and continues down the hallway.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY

               Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, 
               then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She 
               produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview 
               mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some 
               Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

               Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie 
               website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. 
               The doorbell rings.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 
               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 
               grin.

                                     MARK
                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.

                                     JUNO
                              (furtive)
                         Is Vanessa here?

                                     MARK
                         Nope. We're safe.

               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

                                     JUNO
                         Cool.

                                     MARK
                         Come on, I have something for you.

               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 
               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 
               to illuminate a bare bulb.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 
                         It's beautiful!

                                     MARK
                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 
                         old comics down here, and I want to 
                         show you one of them.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...

                                     MARK
                         You're gonna like this, I promise.

               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

                                     MARK
                              (extracting a bagged 
                              COMIC from the box)
                         Here it is.

               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 
               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 
               names.

                                     JUNO
                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 
                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!

                                     MARK
                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 
                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 
                         me of you.

               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 
               her.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 
                         fat dork now.

                                     MARK
                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 
                         You should be proud to be the same 
                         condition.

               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!

               Juno is sincerely pleased.

                                     JUNO
                         Okay, how about some tunes?

               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 
               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

                                     JUNO
                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 
                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 
                         still totally rad and hardcore.

               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.

               Mark Laughs.

                                     JUNO
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         I actually know this one.

                                     JUNO
                         You do?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 
                         you can believe that. I danced to it 
                         at my senior prom.

                                     JUNO
                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 
                         did you dance with?

                                     MARK
                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 
                         was a good dance partner. Even let 
                         me put my hands on her butt.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 
                         dancing like a dork!

               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 
               back and forth stiffly.

                                     MARK
                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 
                         Then you put your arms around my 
                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.

               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 
               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, okay. Like this.

                                     MARK
                         You've never been to a dance, have 
                         you?

                                     JUNO
                              (casually defensive)
                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.

                                     MARK
                         What are you?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know.

               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 
               Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I feel like there's something between 
                         us.

               They laugh.

               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 
               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 
               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

                                     MARK
                         I'm leaving Vanessa.

                                     JUNO
                              (quiet at first)
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         It's just not working out, but I'm 
                         getting my own place in the city... 
                         and I've got it all planned out. 
                         It's something I've wanted to do for 
                         a long time...

               Juno backs away.

                                     JUNO
                              (growing)
                         No.

                                     MARK
                         No?

                                     JUNO
                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 
                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 
                         of no!

                                     MARK
                         What's the matter?

                                     JUNO
                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 
                         guys have to take care of... this! 
                         You are the chosen custodians of the 
                         big-ass bump!

               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 
               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

                                     MARK
                         But I thought you'd be cool if...

                                     JUNO
                              (interrupting)
                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 
                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 
                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 
                         else's family. Listen, once I have 
                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 
                         be happy, and everything will be all 
                         right. Believe me on this one!

                                     MARK
                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 
                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 
                         to be a father.

                                     JUNO
                              (aghast)
                         But you're old!

                                     MARK
                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 
                         Why are you here?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know. I just liked being 
                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 
                         furniture in your weird life.

                                     MARK
                         This...
                              (he gestures to the 
                              dank surrounding 
                              room)
                         ...this is what my life has become. 
                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 
                         Is that so appealing to you?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 
                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

                                     MARK
                         That's not the point. We're just not 
                         in love anymore.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 
                         when you married her? If you love 
                         someone once, you can love them again, 
                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 
                         out with the same guy, like, four 
                         times. You're just not trying.

               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.

                                     MARK
                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 
                         what an idiot I am.

               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.

                                     JUNO
                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 
                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 
                         with your wife.

                                     MARK
                         God, you're so young.

                                     JUNO
                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 
                         enough to tell when people are acting 
                         like total a-holes!

               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 
               Mark.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 
                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 
                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 
                         noise, man!

               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the 
               front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning 
               home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased 
               NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno? What's going on?

                                     JUNO
                         Nothing.

               It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's 
               lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries 
               her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pretending to be 
                              calm)
                         Mark? Why is Juno crying?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine 
                         home furnishings. See you later.

               She rushes toward the door.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hold on.

               Juno halts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno, what's the matter?

                                     MARK
                         She's hormonal. Right, June? It's 
                         just part of the whole process.

               Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa 
               looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying.

                                     VANESSA
                         What did you do?

                                     MARK
                         I didn't do anything... I just... 
                         I've just been thinking.

                                     VANESSA
                              (you've been thinking?)
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         Just thinking if this is really the 
                         right thing for us.

                                     VANESSA
                         What are you referring to?

               She knows exactly to what he's referring.

                                     MARK
                         I've been just wondering if we're, 
                         you know, ready.

                                     VANESSA
                         Of course we're ready. We've taken 
                         all the classes. The nursery. The 
                         books --

                                     MARK
                         I know we're prepared. I just don't 
                         know if... I'm ready.

               Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to Juno)
                         Juno, don't worry about this. He 
                         just has cold feet. That's how boys 
                         are. The books all say the same thing. 
                         A woman becomes a mother when she 
                         gets pregnant. A man becomes a father 
                         when he sees his baby. He's going to 
                         get there. He'll get there.

               Juno ain't buying it.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to Mark)
                         Why don't we let Juno go home and we 
                         can discuss this later on, okay?

                                     MARK
                         It all just happened so fast. We put 
                         that ad in the paper. I thought it 
                         would take months if, you know, ever 
                         and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, 
                         she's in our living room.

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         She answered our prayers.

                                     MARK
                              (ignores the comment)
                         Ever since, it's just been like a 
                         ticking clock.

               This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.

                                     VANESSA
                         What are you saying?

               A long hideous beat.

                                     MARK
                         It just feels a little like bad 
                         timing.

               Another hideous beat.

                                     VANESSA
                         What would be a good time for you?

                                     MARK
                         I don't know. There's just things I 
                         still want to do.

                                     VANESSA
                         Like what? Be a rock star?

                                     MARK
                         Don't mock me.

               Vanessa sighs. It's done.

                                     VANESSA
                         You're trying to do something that's 
                         never going to happen. And you know 
                         what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. 
                         If I have to wait for you to become 
                         Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a 
                         mother.

               Vanessa looks defeated.

                                     MARK
                         I never said I'd be a great father.

               We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over 
               and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON

               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 
               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

               The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the 
               shoulder.

               INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON

               Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for 
               the first time since she became pregnant.

               After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. 
               He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.

               EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT

               Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. 
               We push in close... when she gets an idea.

               She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she 
               finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and 
               pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting 
               alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of 
               wine.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events 
               sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join 
               her.

                                     MARK
                         I called Gerta Rauss. She says she 
                         can represent both of us. They call 
                         it "collaborative divorce." It's 
                         apparently all the rage right now. 
                         And it's easy because we don't have 
                         children.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, it's fine. Thanks for making the 
                         call, I guess.

               Mark nods and sits down.

                                     VANESSA
                         We're actually, finally doing this?

                                     MARK
                         Looks like it, yeah.

                                     VANESSA
                         Have you found a place to stay?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, downtown.

                                     VANESSA
                         A hotel?

                                     MARK
                         It's a loft.

                                     VANESSA
                              (lightly teasing)
                         Aren't you the cool guy?

               They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.

                                     VANESSA
                         I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.

               She buries her head in her hands.

                                     MARK
                         I know you did.

               There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

               Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting 
               on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the 
               van.

               Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute 
               because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He 
               holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.

                                     MARK
                         It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.

               Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, 
               examining it.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's for me.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's 
               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I never realize how much I like being 
                         home unless I've been somewhere really 
                         different for a while.

               She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family 
               finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.

               Juno enters.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi Dad.

                                     MAC
                         Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. 
                         Where have you been?

                                     JUNO
                         Dealing with stuff way beyond my 
                         maturity level. Where is everyone?

                                     MAC
                         Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot 
                         ice skating class.

                                     JUNO
                         Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. 
                         Liberty Bell's still getting the 
                         hang of stairs.

                                     MAC
                         No, but you know Bren. She dreams 
                         big.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, she does.

                                     MAC
                         You look a little morose, honey. 
                         What's eating you?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm losing my faith in humanity.

                                     MAC
                         Think you can narrow it down for me.

                                     JUNO
                         I guess I wonder sometimes if people 
                         ever stay together for good.

                                     MAC
                         You mean like couples?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, like people in love.

                                     MAC
                         Are you having boy trouble? I gotta 
                         be honest; I don't much approve of 
                         you dating in your condition, 
                         'cause... well, that's kind of messed 
                         up.

                                     JUNO
                         Dad, no!

                                     MAC
                         Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't 
                         that what you girls call it? Skanky? 
                         Skeevy?

                                     JUNO
                         Please stop now.

                                     MAC
                              (persisting)
                         Tore up from the floor up?

                                     JUNO
                         Dad, it's not about that. I just 
                         need to know that it's possible for 
                         two people to stay happy together 
                         forever. Or at least for a few years.

                                     MAC
                         It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, 
                         I may not have the best track record 
                         in the world, but I have been with 
                         your stepmother for ten years now, 
                         and I'm proud to say that we're very 
                         happy.

               Juno nods in agreement.

                                     MAC
                         In my opinion, the best thing you 
                         can do is to find a person who loves 
                         you for exactly what you are. Good 
                         mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, 
                         handsome, what have you, the right 
                         person will still think that the sun 
                         shines out your ass. That's the kind 
                         of person that's worth sticking with.

               A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face.

                                     JUNO
                         I sort of already have.

                                     MAC
                         Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You 
                         know I'll always be there to love 
                         and support you, no matter what kind 
                         of pickle you're in.

               He nods toward her belly.

                                     MAC
                         Obviously.

               Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his 
               cheek.

                                     JUNO
                         I need to go out somewhere for just 
                         a little while. I don't have any 
                         homework, and I swear I'll be back 
                         by ten.

               She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.

                                     MAC
                         You were talking about me, right?

               MONTAGE:

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the 
               window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah 
               running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

               Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning 
               run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the 
               stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."

               He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch 
               on the mailbox.

               At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come 
               pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the 
               driveway. Bleeker smiles.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING

               Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, 
               ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. 
               They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching 
               and jogs up to the chainlink fence.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Did you put like a hundred things of 
                         Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. That was me.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Why?

                                     JUNO
                              (blushes)
                         Because they're your fave. And you 
                         can never have too much of your 
                         favorite one-calorie breath mint.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty 
                         much set until college on the Tic 
                         Tac front.

                                     JUNO
                         You know, I've been thinking. I'm 
                         really sorry I was such a huge bitch 
                         to you. You didn't deserve that. You 
                         never deserve any of the poo I unload 
                         on you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You know it's okay.

                                     JUNO
                         Also, I think I'm in love with you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         What, you mean as friends?

                                     JUNO
                         No, for real. I think you are the 
                         coolest person I've ever met. And 
                         you don't even have to try.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I try really hard, actually...

                                     JUNO
                         No, you're naturally smart. You always 
                         think of the funniest things to do. 
                         Remember when you passed me that 
                         postcard during Spanish class, and 
                         it was addressed like, "Junebug 
                         MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the 
                         Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having 
                         fun in Barcelona -- wish you were 
                         here"? That was hilarious.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I was just bored. I only think school 
                         is awesome like, 80% of the time.

                                     JUNO
                         Plus, you're the only person who 
                         doesn't stare at my stomach all the 
                         fucking time. You actually look at 
                         my face. And every time I look at 
                         you, the baby starts kicking me super 
                         hard.

                                     BLEEKER
                         It does?

               Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Wizard!

                                     JUNO
                         I think it's because my heart starts 
                         pounding when I see you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Mine too.

                                     JUNO
                         Basically, I'm completely smitten 
                         with you, and I don't care if I'm 
                         making an ass out of myself right 
                         now, because you've seen me make an 
                         ass out of myself a million times, 
                         and you still want to be my friend.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, yeah. You're the best friend 
                         I've ever had, even when you're being 
                         kind of evil.

                                     JUNO
                         That's all I need from you. That's 
                         more than I could ever ask for. You're 
                         just golden, dude.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Can we make out now?

                                     JUNO
                         Okay.

               Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team 
               guys in the background.

               In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE 
               RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the 
               makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

               LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the 
               fence, rolling her eyes.

                                     LEAH
                              (disgusted)
                         You know, you can go into early labor 
                         sucking face like that!

               Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with 
               Bleeker.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling. 
               She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. She revs a 
               Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll. 
               Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats 
               her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.

                                     JUNO
                         Dad!

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - MAC'S WORK DESK - SAME

               Mac looks up from the lure he's working on.

                                     MAC (O.S.)
                         What?!

                                     JUNO
                         Either I just pissed my pants or...

                                     MAC (O.S.)
                         Or...

                                     JUNO
                         Thundercats are go!

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

               Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile 
               into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them, 
               protesting.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               CU of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap. She's being pushed 
               down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into 
               giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her 
               rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair 
               into a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.

               Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the 
               wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap. 
               Leah and Juno snicker.

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

               We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing 
               impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She's wearing 
               her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown. 
               Leah and Bren stand nearby.

               Juno doubles over in pain.

                                     JUNO
                              (panicked)
                         Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I 
                         get that Spinal Tap thing?

                                     BREN
                         It's called a spinal block, and you 
                         can't have it yet, honey. The doctor 
                         said you're not dilated enough.

                                     JUNO
                         You mean I have to wait for it to 
                         get even worse? Why can't they just 
                         give it to me now?

                                     BREN
                         Well, honey, doctors are sadists who 
                         like to play God and watch lesser 
                         people scream.

               Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.

                                     BREN
                              (checking her watch)
                         Shit.
                              (To the doctor)
                         Hey, can we give my kid the damn 
                         spinal tap already?

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - LATER

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It really didn't hurt that bad having 
                         him.

               We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her POV. Leah 
               holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         The best part was when I peed on 
                         Leah during labor.

               We see Leah holding Juno's FOOT, which is shaking. Leah's 
               shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths "Fuck you" at 
               Juno. Juno's raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         And then, out of nowhere, there it 
                         was...

               The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         There he was.

               Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to 
               flutter... and she passes out.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON

               Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him 
               on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the 
               bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate 
               Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding 
               a video camera.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I decided to not call Bleeker to 
                         tell him that I was having the baby. 
                         He had a big meet against Manteno 
                         and I didn't want him to get all 
                         worried about me and choke.

               Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so 
               people in attendance cheer.

                                     VIJAY
                              (admiringly)
                         His legs are as swift as his seed.

                                     MRS. BLEEKER
                         What did you say?

               Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         P. Bleeker has just broken a district 
                         record in the 400.

               Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.

               She's not there.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         But he figured it out anyway.

               Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without 
               stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.

               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY

               A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 
               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

               The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

                                     NURSE
                         Would you like to meet your son?

               Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, 
               paralyzed, several feet away.

                                     VANESSA
                         I have a son?

                                     NURSE
                              (amused)
                         You are the adoptive mother?

                                     VANESSA
                         I have a son.

                                     NURSE
                         Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any 
                         time getting out.

               Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 
               her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.

               She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren 
               leaning against the doorway.

               Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

                                     VANESSA
                         How do I look?

                                     BREN
                              (gently)
                         Like a mom. Scared shitless.

               Vanessa laughs.

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

               Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth 
               is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and 
               accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared 
               out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's 
               not sure what to say.

               He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, 
               but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His 
               expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

                                     MAC
                         Someday, you'll be back here, honey. 
                         On your terms.

               Juno nods and swallows.

               Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. 
               It's Bleeker in his track uniform.

               Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances 
               at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his 
               throat, gets up and leaves the room.

               Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
               arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for 
               the first time in months.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING

               Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared 
               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and 
               swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track 
               uniform and spikes.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Bleeker decided he didn't want to 
                         see the baby. Neither did I, really. 
                         He didn't feel like ours.

               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING

               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her 
               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I think he was always hers.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

               The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate 
               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the 
               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It ended with a chair.

               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something." 
               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it 
               says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."

               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa 
               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the 
               baby for a single moment.

               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

               It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who 
               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY

               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not 
               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is 
                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my 
                         macaroni. I know people are supposed 
                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 
                         but normalcy's not really our style.

               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 
               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning 
               his guitar.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY

               Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles 
               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings.

                                     JUNO
                         Ready?

               Bleeker nods.

               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else 
               But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first 
               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're a part time lover and a 
                         fulltime friend. The monkey on your 
                         back is the latest trend. I don't 
                         see what anyone can see, in anyone 
                         else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         Here is the church and here is the 
                         steeple. We sure are cute for two 
                         ugly people. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         We both have shiny happy fits of 
                         rage. You want more fans, I want 
                         more stage. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         You are always trying to keep it 
                         real. I'm in love with how you feel. 
                         I don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I kiss you on the brain in the shadow 
                         of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, 
                         my body's swinging from side to side. 
                         I don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         The pebbles forgive me, the trees 
                         forgive me. So why can't you forgive 
                         me? I don't see what anyone can see, 
                         in anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
                         Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du 
                         du du dudu. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

               She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile 
               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

               Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with 
               life and summer activity.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               The credits begin to roll.

               Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in 
               preparation for a formal reception.

               Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.

               Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.

               Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.

               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.

               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with 
               decorative garnish.

               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting 
               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, 
               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and 
               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, 
               sour look.

               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared 
               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet 
               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing 
               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The 
               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.

               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.

               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, 
               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From 
               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A 
               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.

               EXT. ESTATE - DAY

               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a 
               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, 
               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He 
               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.

               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the 
               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.

               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly 
               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. 
               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling 
               the staff to clean up the mess.

               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS

               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.

               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.

               Hot water is poured into a bath.

               Carriages begin to arrive.

               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.

               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.

               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat 
               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens 
               a corset around his mid-section from behind.

               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.

               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver 
               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch 
               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.

               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet 
               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold 
               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and 
               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.

               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his 
               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.

               CLOSE UP

               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.

               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.

               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.

               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.

               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.

               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails 
               to the knees is fitted to his torso.

               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.

               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.

               His cheeks are pinched.

               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.

               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He 
               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a 
               waffle:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like a herd of cattle, 
                         Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman 
                         who lights up the room... simply by 
                         leaving it.

               He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, 
               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold 
               in the looking glass.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join 
                         us downstairs after completing this 
                         one-sided flash of wit?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle 
                         Otto. No one really listens to anyone 
                         else. If you attempt it, you will 
                         see why.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         You judge everything too severely. I 
                         wonder what would happen if you were 
                         to cast that critical eye inward?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You do not wonder at all. You merely 
                         ask in order to state your own 
                         opinion.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         We are all concerned about you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ahh, here it comes.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Your life does not seem to have any 
                         direction. At the age of 25 a man is 
                         too young to do anything well. At 35 
                         he is too old. Now is your time to 
                         take action. Tell me, what is it you 
                         want to DO with your life?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (wearily)
                         I do not know.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                              (just as weary)
                         Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
                              (he slaps Leopold's 
                              face twice rather 
                              quickly)
                         Wake up! This is your one and only 
                         life. Every man has the chance to 
                         make a difference. DO something!

               Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am most grateful for your 
                         surveillance and for your sympathy. 
                         I assure you there is no need for 
                         concern. I am as effectual and 
                         attentive... as my position allows.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Life is not position, Leopold. It is 
                         action.
                              (he straightens 
                              Leopold's tie)
                         I will see you downstairs promptly. 
                         In the appropriate frame of mind.

               He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. 
               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. 
               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.

               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He 
               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...

                                     THE VALET
                              (grandly)
                         Go spread joy.

               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian 
               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance 
               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is 
               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting 
               God.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically 
               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly 
               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.

               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing 
               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out 
               of frame.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 
               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away 
               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows 
               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams 
               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky 
               teeth.

               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of 
               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he 
               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except 
               her enormous bosom.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like an angel, Miss 
                         Fairchild. You light up the room. I 
                         thank you.

               Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, 
               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.

               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She 
               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. 
               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good evening. I do not believe I 
                         have had the pleasure.

               The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes 
               he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.

                                     CARLSON
                         ...Julia Carlson.

               Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (slightly tipsy)
                         You are not from the area, are you?

                                     CARLSON
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              her head "No")
                         Are you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is my estate.

                                     CARLSON
                         Really?
                              (looking around the 
                              room)
                         Well it's not home but it's much...

               Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There 
               is a hubbub amongst the guests.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.

                                     CARLSON
                         The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't 
                         it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is a scandal nonetheless.

               Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson, do me the honor?

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (smiling seductively)
                         Truly I would be in your debt. Any 
                         admonition would be erased simply by 
                         presenting a partner as lovely as 
                         yourself.

                                     CARLSON
                         No, no. Really, I...

               Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, 
               takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.

               They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA-
               BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, 
               shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suppose we really ought to sing 
                         along.

                                     CARLSON
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, golly.

               They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their 
               emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes 
               freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                              (breathless)
                         Thank you for the dance. It was 
                         lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Not at all. It was most enlightening.

               There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes 
               midnight.

                                     CARLSON
                         I really must be going.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I won't hear of it.

                                     CARLSON
                              (moving away from him)
                         No, I'm quite late as it is.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shall see you to the door...

                                     CARLSON
                              (stopping him 
                              resolutely)
                         You're very sweet. I had a wonderful 
                         time.
                              (she watches him, 
                              memorizing his face. 
                              Then firmly)
                         Goodbye.

               Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He 
               watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard 
               door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.

               EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

               Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the 
               dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes 
               back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She 
               is once again writing in her notebook.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson?

               Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. 
               Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, 
               MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting 
               a weird glow.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God...

                                     CARLSON
                         What are you...? You frightened me.

               Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch 
               it...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What sort of mechanism is this?

               Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!

                                     CARLSON
                         It's perfectly all right. It's...

               Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. 
               Carlson FREEZES.

                                     CARLSON
                              (carefully, 
                              deliberately)
                         Listen to me. Please. Move very 
                         slowly. Step out of the machine. 
                         Step out and I'll explain whatever 
                         you want to know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this? Who are you?

               His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.

                                     CARLSON
                         Oh, God.

               She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, 
               accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls 
               from the machine.

                                     CARLSON
                              (suddenly frantic)
                         Get out of there! Get out now!

               The machine LIGHTS UP.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson... I...

                                     CARLSON
                         No!!!

               The compartment door snaps shut.

                                     CARLSON
                         Shit!!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. N.Y.C. LABORATORY - 1995 DAY

               The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an 
               Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of 
               enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She turns to her co-workers, warning them.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She looks back at Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR. 
               DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Good God!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Everybody stay calm... Lock the front 
                         door.

               Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious 
               Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         No, no, no. You mustn't touch him. 
                         The consequences could be 
                         catastrophic.

                                     DR. KAU
                         He could be hurt, or even dead.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         ...All right. Touch him.

               They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on 
               the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         ...But I'm stuck and it's only a 
                         dance and he IS the seventh Duke of 
                         Albany...

               They all look at one another, then back at Leopold.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Carlson...!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (racing from the room)
                         Give me a minute...

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!

               INT. LAB - KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               KATHERINE COLES, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically 
               into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard 
               not to sound upset.

                                     KATE
                         Who's upset? People fall in love, 
                         they have to climb back out.
                              (she laughs but she 
                              is not smiling)
                         So, what? We'll just be friends now, 
                         Right?

               She stops typing and listens for a while. She runs her hand 
               through her hair.

                                     KATE
                         I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
                              (using her middle 
                              finger she pushes up 
                              her glasses)
                         No. I'll just think of this as 
                         surviving another dating accident. 
                         Take care or good luck or whatever 
                         I'm supposed to...

               The line goes dead.

                                     KATE
                         ...say... Goodbye.

               Dr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly 
               becomes very centered.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         She's back.

                                     KATE
                              (rising)
                         That's impossible! She wasn't supposed 
                         to return until...

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Kate. It's Carlson. Something went 
                         wrong.

               He hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down.

                                     KATE
                         ...The 7th Duke...

               INT. LAB - DAY

                                     KATE
                              (all business, reading 
                              from a printout)
                         ...of Albany. He was the... IS the 
                         son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no 
                         actual importance until he vanished 
                         at the turn of the century without a 
                         trace. It was a sensation. In the 
                         30's they even made a movie about 
                         him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (absently)
                         I love Ronald Coleman.

                                     KATE
                         Despite much speculation and a nation 
                         wide investigation, a body was never 
                         found. He was never heard from again.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Until now.

               There is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We've altered the course of history.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We never should have started this...

                                     KATE
                         Calm down.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         What are we going to do? We can't 
                         keep him here. Imagine if anyone 
                         found out!

                                     KATE
                         Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, 
                         no one would believe such a stupid 
                         mistake could be made because no one 
                         would believe any of this is possible. 
                         So. We fix this. We keep this to 
                         ourselves and we fix it. Fast.

               They all nod in agreement.

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st 
                         priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, 
                         determine the reciprocal correlation's 
                         connected to the 19th century. Work 
                         24 hours a day if necessary. In the 
                         meantime... one of us will have to 
                         take charge of him.

               She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives 
               her away.

                                     KATE
                         This is a major scientific 
                         opportunity. It doesn't get any better 
                         than this. Imagine. Researching the 
                         behavior, the physical and emotional 
                         characteristics of a century ago! 
                         Utilizing technology available to us 
                         today... He's a gold mine!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.

                                     KATE
                         And while he's here, he's ours. Any 
                         volunteers?

               No one moves.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked 
                         will be responsible. Agreed?

               They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them 
               in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:

                                     DR. KAU
                         I'll do it.

               All the scientists face her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You'll look after him?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No, I meant I'll pick the name.

               She reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally 
               SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat.

                                     KATE
                         Fine.

               Leopold stirs. He blinks at the group.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where...? What has happened?!

               The doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround 
               Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally:

                                     KATE
                         Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee 
                         aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge 
                         research team. A project funded by 
                         the government of the United States.

                              (regarding their 
                              appearance with 
                              distaste)
                         Oh. Americans. I see...

                                     KATE
                         Yes, um... For the past six and a 
                         half years we've been conducting 
                         scientific experiments on density 
                         and flexibility in the dimensions of 
                         time and space.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came 
                         upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... 
                         particles traveling faster than the 
                         speed of light, which allowed us 
                         to... fold time so to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Yes. Bend it between the cracks of 
                         the dimensions.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yes.

               They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Now, while that wasn't the original 
                         purpose of our experiment, we opted 
                         to pursue it, well, privately, on 
                         our own.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Borrowing funds already provided.

                                     KATE
                         We journeyed to your time because it 
                         was the quickest path to follow. We 
                         debated long and hard whether we 
                         should use this knowledge at all. 
                         Believe me, it was never our intent 
                         to disturb the past...

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Merely to discover if the expedition 
                         were possible. As your presence here 
                         confirms... we are very disturbed.

               Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         The problem facing us is not only 
                         HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you 
                         see?

                                     KATE
                         We certainly don't want to 
                         miscalculate. Send you to a different 
                         era entirely.

               Leopold starts to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Rest assured, no harm will come to 
                         you. You'll be well looked after by 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What 
                         do you mean, get me back home?... 
                         Where am I?

               Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for 
               the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting 
               and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. 
               The doctors are silent.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!...
                              (slowly)
                         Would you have me believe... I am 
                         being detained, at present in the 
                         HEREAFTER?... The time to come?

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (carefully)
                         It is the year nineteen hundred and 
                         ninety-five.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...19...?

               Leopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're insane! All of you! This is 
                         impossible!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Leopold, calm down!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A voyage through time! What do you 
                         take me for? Did you bring me here 
                         by force?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We're scientist, not seditionists.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (truly panicked)
                         Let me out of here! I won't stand 
                         for this another moment!

               He's out the door.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY

               Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit 
               hallway, the doctors close behind.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, wait!

                                     DR. KAU
                         You don't know what you're doing.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Just listen to what we have to say!

               It is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs 
               upstairs.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights. 
               Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car 
               alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all 
               in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         19...?

               The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Kate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto 
               his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter 
               disbelief.

                                     KATE
                         Squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab?

                                     KATE
                         I remember reading they ate a lot of 
                         squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab... Do you have a squab?

                                     KATE
                              (quietly. On the verge 
                              of panic)
                         I don't know!

                                     DR. KAU
                         Pull yourself together!
                              (turning to Leopold)
                         Are you all right back there?

               Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, 
               magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate 
               watches him in her rear view mirror.

                                     KATE
                         You're going to be fine you know. 
                         There's nothing to worry about. I 
                         have everything under control.

               Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly to Dr. Kau)
                         We'll never get away with this.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. 
               His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly 
               rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out 
               on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes 
               his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.

               There is a KNOCK on the door.

               Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of 
               dignity.

                                     KATE
                         How are you feeling?
                              (no response)
                         I thought you might like some tea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I insist on being returned home 
                         immediately.

                                     KATE
                         I understand. We're doing our best.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I wish to speak with your employer, 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You're speaking to him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are not suggesting that you are 
                         Dr. Coles?

               She smiles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss... uh?

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles. If you like, you could 
                         call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's 
                         too much, how about just plain Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (coldly)
                         A WOMAN of science?

                                     KATE
                         Hard to believe?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But a woman's brain cannot obtain 
                         enough knowledge to posses a truly 
                         scientific mind.

                                     KATE
                              (jotting this down)
                         Interesting. Nevertheless, we've 
                         come a long way baby.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (confused)
                         Are you attempting to be humorous?

                                     KATE
                         I'm attempting to be informative 
                         it's just coming out humorous.

               Leopold regards her dubiously.

                                     KATE
                              (clinically)
                         Look, modern social science clearly 
                         states that a woman's place in society 
                         marks the level of that civilization. 
                         A science career for a woman is now 
                         almost as acceptable as being a... 
                         a... waitress. Cream and sugar?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young lady, I... Surely it is not 
                         expected that I remain here with you 
                         indefinitely... Unchaperoned?

                                     KATE
                              (pen poised)
                         Does that make you nervous?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Certainly not!

                                     KATE
                              (writing)
                         Then what are you getting so red 
                         about? It's a very large apartment... 
                         with locks on all the doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The idea! My dear Miss Coles...

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey...

                                     KATE
                              (she puts the pad 
                              down)
                         Let's get one thing straight right 
                         now. My name is Kate or Katherine or 
                         if you insist Dr. Coles.
                              (she rises)
                         Take a good long look, Leopold. I am 
                         a 20th century American woman with a 
                         Doctorate and a commission and 
                         independence. I am not your "young 
                         lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your 
                         "honey." Is that clear?

               Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey... For the tea.

                                     KATE
                         ...I'll get it for you.

               Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard 
               searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear 
               and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries 
               posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the 
               toaster.

               INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

               Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you... Has it been decided 
                         what it is I am to do while I am 
                         being held here?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, 
                         a little light housework...

               Leopold doesn't react.

                                     KATE
                              (clearing her throat)
                         I took the liberty of preparing a 
                         simple schedule to efficiently utilize 
                         your time while incorporating you 
                         into my routine.
                              (she hands him a 
                              schedule)
                         As you can see, my day begins with 
                         meditation and yoga from 6:30 to 
                         7:00.

               She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable.

                                     KATE
                         YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and 
                         change and at 7:15, we breakfast 
                         together. 7:45 we begin the days 
                         work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to 
                         observe you in your natural routine 
                         as I research the data that will 
                         enable you to return home. At 1:15 
                         we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a 
                         daily questionnaire, I type up my 
                         notes. At precisely 6:15 you will 
                         enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then, 
                         at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while 
                         making dinner as YOU write down any 
                         questions that come up during your 
                         day. At 7:00, we dine together. If 
                         you need me at any time you may ring 
                         this bell.

               She rings a tiny dinner bell. He is about to speak.

                                     KATE
                         Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have 
                         computer science class, Tuesdays I 
                         have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm 
                         usually home by 9:15. During these 
                         periods you may read any of the books 
                         I've picked out for you in your room. 
                         I organize my next days work at 10:30, 
                         11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in 
                         bed.
                              (she takes a breath, 
                              smiles at him)
                         Next day we begin again. Simple?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat, with 
                              great dignity)
                         ...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?

               Kate is forced into a stunned silence.

                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                         Kate? I'm home.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your father?

                                     KATE
                         Sort of. My brother.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Visiting?

                                     KATE
                         For the past two years. Charlie can 
                         never know about this project. We'll 
                         tell him you are a... overly 
                         distinguished colleague staying here 
                         as our guest. From Canada. Which 
                         would explain your lack of familiarity 
                         with our customs and so forth

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (aghast)
                         A CANADIAN?

                                     KATE
                         Make yourself comfortable. I'll check 
                         in on you later. I think this is 
                         going very well, don't you?

               Leopold looks at her blankly.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. If you need anything, just 
                         ring.

               Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out. 
               P.O.V. still on Leopold.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                              (shouting)
                         Charlie!

               Leopold reacts.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                              (screaming just as 
                              loud)
                         What?

                                     KATE
                              (still shouting)
                         Come here I wanna talk to you.

               Leopold listens at the door. He slowly opens it, takes two 
               steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back 
               in. He takes a DEEP FRIGHTENED BREATH and slowly deflates.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - MORNING

               Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by 
               his paintings. He is a likable twentysomething with a big 
               mouth.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I do?

                                     KATE
                              (removing his coffee 
                              from the table, 
                              setting it on a 
                              coaster)
                         RINGS! And what did I say about you 
                         smoking in the house?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You were against it.

                                     KATE
                         Correct. You're back early.
                              (She takes away his 
                              cigarette)

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey!... Are you all right? You look 
                         funny.

                                     KATE
                         Funny ha ha or funny odd?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Both.

                                     KATE
                         That all depends. How was your trip?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why?

                                     KATE
                         If it was good I'll tell you the 
                         truth. If it was rotten I'll have to 
                         butter you up first.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Butter me up.

                                     KATE
                         Have you been working out? No, I'm 
                         really starting to see results. Are 
                         you comfortable there on the couch?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Very.

                                     KATE
                         Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there 
                         the next few nights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate!

                                     KATE
                         You have to be out of here by 8 and 
                         you can't be back before 6. We have 
                         an important man working with us 
                         with very unusual needs. The company 
                         is insisting he stay here.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about a hotel?

                                     KATE
                         This man requires around the clock 
                         attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I meant for me.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you, Charlie.
                              (she kisses his 
                              forehead)
                         I owe you one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe me nine. What am I supposed 
                         to do all day?

                                     KATE
                              (as if having an 
                              epiphany)
                         You could get a job!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, the entire point of being an 
                         artist is that I don't have to work. 
                         Who is this guy?

                                     KATE
                         Well, I can't tell you much because...

                                     KATE AND CHARLIE
                         I'm not allowed to discuss what goes 
                         on at the office.

                                     KATE
                         Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be 
                         interesting to have someone else to 
                         talk to. It gets so quiet around 
                         here sometimes I feel like I've gone 
                         deaf.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does he have a label?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his 
                         name?

                                     KATE
                         He's exactly like his name.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then you owe me ten.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. 
               Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up 
               to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright 
               fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to 
               rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. 
               He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button 
               ON.

               Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before 
               an excited crowd.

               Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of 
               him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, 
               slams the power OFF.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Horrible!

               He quickly scurries out the hallway.

               He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, 
               he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he 
               purposefully steps back inside.

               He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted 
               by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. 
               He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly 
               examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.

               He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks 
               the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment 
               in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.

               Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the 
               lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     KATE
                              (explaining)
                         He's from Canada...

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie 
               banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (finally)
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         It's called Hamburger Helper.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is beyond help. Please serve the 
                         next course.

               He pushes his plate away.

                                     KATE
                         I'm afraid there is no next course. 
                         If you make a list of the foods you 
                         like, I'll pick them up at the store 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is all food here this... textured?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mine's good.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please understand, I am used to a 
                         different sort of preparation. Where 
                         I come from a proper meal is the 
                         result of reflection and study. A 
                         recipe is merely a theme which an 
                         intelligent cook can plan each time 
                         with variation.

               Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Several courses are served. Menus 
                         are often prepared days in advance, 
                         timed to perfection. It is said, 
                         without the culinary art, the 
                         crudeness of reality would make life 
                         unbearable.

                                     CHARLIE
                         In Canada?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat. Firmly)
                         In Canada.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We have a saying here. "Shake and 
                         shake the catsup bottle, none will 
                         come and then a lot'll."

               He pours catsup on his dinner.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How interesting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Since you're such an expert on fine 
                         cuisine, why don't you make dinner 
                         tomorrow night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It should be obvious to you that I 
                         am NOT a domestic. You may take my 
                         plate.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have my own, thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who died and made me Cinderella?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young man, there is a distinct 
                         impertinence to your voice.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's part of my charm.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Suppress it.

                                     KATE
                              (changing the subject)
                         Leopold... Since you're our guest 
                         here, there are several cultural 
                         events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie 
                         has season tickets to the ball game. 
                         Perhaps you'd like to take that in?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Or the Opera or the Ballet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, there's no rule that says 
                         everyone has to be interested in 
                         baseball.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, but I believe there is a rule 
                         that says everyone has to have HEARD 
                         of it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, your brother Charles 
                         attitude and demeanor are 
                         unacceptable. If I am to stay on 
                         here you must have a serious talk 
                         with him regarding respect and 
                         civility.

                                     KATE
                         CHARLES, could you help me with the 
                         dessert in the kitchen?

                                     CHARLIE
                         In the kitchen?

                                     KATE
                         IN the kitchen. Excuse us.

               Kate and Charlie leave. The camera remains on Leopold, sitting 
               alone, calmly sipping his wine. VOICE OVER FROM THE KITCHEN:

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't believe this guy!

                                     KATE
                         Try to be nice to him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm always NICE!

                                     KATE
                         Please Charlie, as a favor to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He gives me the creeps.

               Leopold reacts. He listens self-consciously.

                                     KATE
                         He's different that's all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What was that crack about domestics?

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, this is important to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not going out with him, are 
                         you?

                                     KATE
                         Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm 
                         not a lost cause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys 
                         you bring home.

                                     KATE
                         I've done countless favors for you! 
                         Now I'm asking for just one little 
                         thing...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (overlapping)
                         Oh, all right! All right! All right!

               They emerge from the kitchen, beaming.

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         We forgot the dessert.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know,... I don't know if I 
                         mentioned it... but that is one fine 
                         looking suit.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - 6:30 A. M.

               Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to 
               sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." Dressed in yoga 
               clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs 
               the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings. Kate flinches 
               but does not open her eyes.

                                     KATE
                              (too sweetly)
                         What is it, Leopold?

               The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine.

                                     KATE
                              (eyes closed, screaming 
                              like a fishwife)
                         WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!

               Leopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed 
               and out of the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing 
               a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the 
               blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is 
               BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every 
               cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly amidst the 
                              chaos)
                         I cannot seem to find the tea...

               CLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open 
               closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No... No... No. Good God, no!... 
                         Perhaps...

               He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell.

               INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks 
               her schedule and bangs on the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your time is up! What's he 
                         got, a girl in there?

               INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap" 
               marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He 
               picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. 
               It SPRAYS.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He 
               discovers the clapper has been stolen.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks 
               up and stops suddenly.

               Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of 
               Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, 
               bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses 
               foppishly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I should like to read about modern 
                         currency during my bath tonight. See 
                         that the tub and basin are scrubbed 
                         up. Remnants remain of this afternoons 
                         shave.

               Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of 
               clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing 
               skis.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds.

               INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

               He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. 
               Each are wearing a walkman.

               He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously 
               until they look up.

               INT. STUDY - DAY

               Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian 
               customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. 
               A beat.

               Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles 
               papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. 
               She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty 
               room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, 
               she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the 
               window and looks out.

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the 
               brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. 
               He moves to the window and looks out.

               EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly 
               pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.

                                     KATE
                         In our last session you intimated 
                         there was a symmetrical system 
                         regulating the social order of 
                         conformity spanning your era. I found 
                         this particularly intriguing If I 
                         can just find it in my notes...

               A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then 
               turns back, excited.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fire brigade!

               Kate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks 
               water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is insufferable! I refuse to be 
                         spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled 
                         about any longer. I have yet to 
                         venture outside this cell. Before I 
                         go mad a more suitable arrangement 
                         must be found.

                                     KATE
                         Found it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (startled)
                         A resolution?

                                     KATE
                         No I meant I found my notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.

                                     KATE
                         I can hear you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (under control now)
                         Miss Coles, as we are to remain here 
                         together, there are certain conditions 
                         I insist are met and maintained. I 
                         no longer wish to be peeped at, 
                         mocked...

                                     KATE
                         I never...

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly)
                         Or interrupted. Jot this down. 
                         Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner 
                         at 8. A horse should be made available 
                         from 1 to 3.

                                     KATE
                         A horse? In New York City?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about 
                         your style of dress. I do not care 
                         for it.
                              (Kate looks up)
                         I cannot believe it is the prevailing 
                         taste for women to appear masculine 
                         and unkempt. If this is the fashion, 
                         have it altered.

               Kate rises.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That is all for the present.

               He grandly hands her a napkin.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         CRUMBS, my dear!

                                     KATE
                              (infuriated)
                         Thank you!

               Brushing herself off, she heads to the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted 
                         with many women in my time, yet I am 
                         compelled to say that the modern 
                         woman is by far the least attractive 
                         I have ever encountered.

                                     KATE
                              (rising to the occasion)
                         And I have a news flash of my own.

               Leopold waits.

                                     KATE
                         You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!

               She storms out.

               INT. LAB - EARLY MORNING

               Dr. Drake enters Dr. Kau's office with two pints of Haagen 
               Dazs.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough 
                         Swirl or Peach?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Peach.

               They dig in.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Any luck?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No 
                         information exists detailing what 
                         happened to Carlson. I've been working 
                         for weeks and I'm not any closer 
                         than when I began... How are you 
                         doing?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         My cholesterol level is up 70 points.

               Kate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr. 
               Drake's desk. Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through 
               her hair, and in her mouth.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Thank you, Kate... How're you managing 
                         with Leopold?

                                     KATE
                         Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Nothing. I was just asking.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight. 
                         Everything's under control.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Keep up the good work.
                              (after she's gone)
                         She seemed a little scattered. Do 
                         you think everything's all right?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Katherine Coles is the most capable 
                         person we have on this project. If 
                         anyone can handle the delicacy of 
                         this situation, Kate can.

                                     DR. KAU
                         So there's nothing to worry about?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Absolutely not.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

                                     KATE
                         GONE? GONE WHERE?!
                              (Charlie shrugs)
                         Charlie we've got to find him!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (working on a VERY 
                              STERN portrait of 
                              Kate at her computer)
                         Are you crazy? This is the first 
                         time all week my eyes aren't darting 
                         to the top of my sockets every five 
                         minutes.

                                     KATE
                         When did he leave?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know. An hour ago? He said 
                         he wanted to take a walk.

                                     KATE
                         And you let him?? He's not allowed 
                         to go outside!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is he being punished?

                                     KATE
                         We've got to find him! You stay here 
                         in case he finds his way back. And 
                         while you wait you'd better pray 
                         he's all right. If anything happens 
                         to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING 
                         we've worked for will have been 
                         destroyed.

               She heads out the door. Charlie follows.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, calm down.

                                     KATE
                         And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?
                              (she grabs her coat 
                              and purse)

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's the big deal? Who is this 
                         guy?

               Kate takes a LONG pause.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold... is not really from Canada.

               EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON

               Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. 
               Suddenly:

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         OH MY GOD!!!

               The pigeons take flight.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING

               Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both 
               ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING 
               brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, 
               caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. 
               A motorist pulls along side of him.

                                     WOMAN MOTORIST
                         You stupid fucking son of a bitch. 
                         Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.

               Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads 
               into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears.

               INT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT

               Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with 
               mounting anger.

                                     CABBY
                         What're ya waiting for lady? An 
                         invitation?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

               She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm.

               EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

               Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. 
               Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled 
               BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He 
               enters a deli.

               INT. DELI - NIGHT

               Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has 
               none.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the counter man)
                         $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You gotta problem with that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It seems rather pricey to me.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So don't buy one.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shan't.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So shan't!

               He moves on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, I... I would be happy to sample 
                         one however I'm afraid I haven't the 
                         finance with me just now. If I could 
                         establish a credit with you, I will 
                         have someone come round with the 
                         funds tomorrow.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a 
                         hamburger today, is that it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little confused)
                         I believe so. Yes.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Get the fuck outta here.

                         Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I remind you, merchant, that I 
                         am the customer in this establishment 
                         and as such require your attention 
                         and the utmost respect. I do not 
                         accept this modern convention of 
                         desecrating one's patrons with such 
                         contemptuous disregard.

                                     YUPPIE WOMAN
                         You tell him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Need I add that without our patronage 
                         you would not own that unwashed 
                         counter behind which you spew your 
                         filthy mouth?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Where do you get off? You don't even 
                         have any money.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Not in my store you're not.

               He comes out from behind the counter. He's big.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very superior)
                         Do you intend to physically escort 
                         me out...?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Did you see what he did? Did you see 
                         that?

               No one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. 
               Thunder is heard.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT

               Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, 
               Alphabet City.

               EXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M.

               Pouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten 
               and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and 
               hastily backs up along side Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Leopold, get in.

               Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and 
               helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat.

               INT. CAR - 4 A.M.

                                     KATE
                              (nearly in tears, 
                              trying to dry him 
                              off)
                         Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're 
                         all right. I didn't think I'd ever 
                         find you. You had us all so worried. 
                         Oh, Leopold!

               She hits him hard.

                                     KATE
                         Don't you ever go out again without 
                         my permission, do you hear me? I was 
                         frantic. You could have been killed 
                         a hundred times over. I never would 
                         have known.

               She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She 
               pulls herself together and looks at him.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, are you all right?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (looking deep into 
                              her eyes for the 
                              first time)
                         I wish to go home.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (badly shaken)
                         No... I wish to go home.

               Kate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight 
               ahead.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                     CHARLIE
                              (on the phone)
                         I don't know. It's just Leopold. 
                         Like Cher. Or Goofy.

               Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. 
                         You look horrible.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, don't start. I haven't been 
                         this angry at you since you got me 
                         into that pyramid thing last year. 
                         If you make a wisecrack I'm going to 
                         burst into flame.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look 
                         horrible.

                                     KATE
                         I'm too tired for this now. I'll 
                         just save it up and kill you tomorrow. 
                         Help Leopold out of his things and 
                         lets get him to bed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I've something to say. To the both 
                         of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. 
                         After witnessing mere weeks of this 
                         age it is painfully apparent I am 
                         outside of my acquaintance... I don't 
                         know how to proceed. I frankly... am 
                         in need of assistance. I'm sorry. 
                         I'm not very good at this. In the 
                         event you have missed it, I am 
                         apologizing.

               There is a long pause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         About time.
                              (he shakes Leopold's 
                              hand reluctantly)
                         Welcome back.
                              (he leaves)

                                     KATE
                         Don't mind him. His heart would be 
                         in the right place if he had a heart. 
                         Surliness runs in my family.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand. It practically races 
                         through mine.

                                     KATE
                              (shocked)
                         Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one 
                         that's not at my expense. That's 
                         good.

               They look at each other just a second too long.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We'd better get to bed... That is...

                                     KATE
                         Yes... I start work...
                              (she looks at her 
                              watch)
                         in three and a half hours.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, dear.

               They self-consciously head to their respective rooms.

                                     KATE
                         It's fine. I'm used to it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You mustn't get too used to it. You'll 
                         find life passes you by awfully 
                         quickly.

               Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and 
               is moved. She catches herself quickly however.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you for...

                                     KATE
                              (waving it away)
                         Oh!

               They stand at their bedroom doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, goodnight then.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?... I don't have a clear 
                         handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong 
                         keeping you confined to the apartment 
                         all this time. I don't know when 
                         you'll be able return home... Tomorrow 
                         I'll start preparing you for the 
                         outside world. And... We'll find 
                         your way back. I promise.

               Leopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the 
               doors to their respective rooms.

               INT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING

               Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         Yes?

               Leopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at 
               Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was 
                         merely... I didn't...

                                     KATE
                         Is there something you want, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I merely wanted to see... that is, 
                         inquire, on your availability, for 
                         an outing... My assimilation and so 
                         forth.

                                     KATE
                         Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of 
                         us. I'll be out in a minute.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, of course. Splendid.

               He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob. 
               He finally finds it and goes out.

               Kate smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Center, 5th Avenue.

               EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY

               Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip 
               Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you certain this is correct?

               Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods 
               approvingly.

                                     KATE
                         Certainly I'm certain.

               Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend 
               it. Kate leads him into Barney's.

               INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

               Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit. 
               He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now really. Isn't this better?

               Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes.

               INT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY

               Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               Kate walks ahead. Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken 
               wheel, hasn't the knack and bangs into everyone and everything 
               in the aisle.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene 
               supplies.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The check out line. As their groceries are being rung up, 
               Leopold spots The Sun, a newspaper with the headline: Woman 
               Sees Satan in her Microwave Oven. Leopold eagerly shows Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you seen today's paper?

                                     KATE
                         Put it back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Back!

               Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm. 
               Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, why is it you are not 
                         married?

                                     KATE
                         Women are longer defined by the men 
                         they're married to, Leopold. I have 
                         a career. I haven't found a man who 
                         fits in with that yet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yet people still marry?

                                     KATE
                              (defensively)
                         I've heard of cases.

               They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate. 
               Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suspect there is something wrong 
                         with you.

                                     KATE
                         There's nothing wrong with me!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps it is the way you present 
                         yourself.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         There is some sort of problem when a 
                         woman reaches thirty and insists on 
                         remaining single.

                                     KATE
                         You think I'm THIRTY?!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         Do I look THIRTY to you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was an arbitrary number.

                                     KATE
                         You chose it specifically opposed to 
                         a lower number.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I didn't mean it.

                                     KATE
                         ...Thirty!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I apologize... How old are you?

                                     KATE
                              (sharply)
                         I'm thirty! But you're the first 
                         person whoever told me I looked it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm sorry.

               Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a 
               good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside. 
               Kate continues down the block.

                                     KATE
                         And it's not that I insist on 
                         remaining single. Believe me. Everyone 
                         dreams of finding somebody to share 
                         their life with. To give someone all 
                         the love they've been hoarding since 
                         they were a kid. I'm no different. 
                         But one has to be sensible. I have a 
                         career and a life that's filled 
                         with...

               She looks around. Leopold is gone.

                                     KATE
                         Not again...

               She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ROBERTA'S, 
               an upscale boutique.

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               Kate races in. Leopold talks with a saleslady.

                                     KATE
                         What do I have to do? Put a leash 
                         around your neck?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the saleslady)
                         She is the woman to whom I was 
                         referring. You see the problem?

                                     SALESLADY
                              (giving Kate the once 
                              over)
                         Yep.

                                     KATE
                              (staring down at her 
                              clothes then back at 
                              the two of them)
                         What?... What?

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others 
               with irritation.

                                     KATE
                         This is ridiculous. I don't have 
                         time to...
                              (she shrieks)
                         Do you know what this dress costs? 
                         Let's get this over with. I'm coming 
                         out. Nobody laugh.

               Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE 
               that she is STUNNING.

                                     KATE
                         Satisfied?

               Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.

                                     KATE
                         ...What?

               She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands 
               behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You have a lovely face.

               Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at 
               herself for a long while.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (quietly)
                         We'll take the dress.

               They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously 
               part.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and 
               hands him the remote control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         The drug of the 20th century.

               She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's 
               spellbound.

               INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits 
               on the sofa watching the TV.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm coming.

               He does not move a muscle.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and 
               watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys 
               this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold 
               grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.

                                     KATE
                              (making notes)
                         It's a guy thing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. 
               Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. 
               She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to 
               capture a better look at his face.

               After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand 
               and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. 
               Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She 
               looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.

               Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to 
               the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly 
               mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.

               She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins 
               pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.

               INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes 
               area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and 
               several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for 
               solutions.

                                     KATE
                         ...Now within that astronomical 
                         structure, Dr. Drake here is searching 
                         for a pathway between your time and 
                         the present. He'll find it too if 
                         his arteries don't harden first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Astounding.

                                     KATE
                         Once that is discovered, the search 
                         begins for the exact time and date 
                         travel will be possible.

               They move to Dr. Kau's area.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Dr. Kau)
                         How are you proceeding?

               Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Don't take it personally. Once Dr. 
                         Kau starts working, you just have to 
                         wait until her batteries run down. 
                         We're all pretty much like that.

               They head into Kate's office.

               INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The complexity of this equation is 
                         astonishing? Can you really comprehend 
                         all that?

                                     KATE
                              (simply. Almost 
                              apologetically)
                         I'm a genius.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.
                              (a beat)
                         That is to say, you all are.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you. And may I say that 
                         sometimes, in DIM light, you're not 
                         so bad yourself.

               They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.

                                     KATE
                         Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm 
                         late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I accompany you?

                                     KATE
                         You mayn't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am not certain I understand therapy.

                                     KATE
                         No one does. That's why therapists 
                         can charge so much.

               As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high 
               heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What exactly transpires during 
                         therapy?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold. A gentleman does not ask 
                         those questions. Come on, we'll get 
                         you home.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am perfectly able to travel homeward 
                         myself.

               Kate looks at him skeptically.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Really! I have finance and our 
                         address. I shall take a cabbie.

               Kate hesitates.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are late. I insist. I am NOT a 
                         child. Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         All right. Don't bite my head off.

               She shakes her head and walks out the door.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet 
               behind, Leopold cautiously follows.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR

               Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, 
               grimaces noticeably at the smell.

               Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into 
               the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.

               He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around 
               to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands 
               NOSE to NOSE with the nun.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't seem to...

                                     NUN
                              (impatiently)
                         Oh, for heaven's sake...

               The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as 
               the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.

               He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in 
               the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly 
               against the glass.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING

               Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray 
               Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a 
               distance.

               INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING

               Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on 
               the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of 
               breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.

                                     MRS. PINCUS
                         I was worried. I thought you weren't 
                         going to make it.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling happily)
                         Miss my lesson? This is the only 
                         thing I have to look forward to all 
                         week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?

               Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her 
               purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.

               An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps 
               her hands together loudly.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         All right, kids. Pair up!

               The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their 
               gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying 
               the floor.

               The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick 
               their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, 
               elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while 
               Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music 
               plays.

               The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate 
               dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a 
               beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING 
               look spread across her face.

               The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the 
                         music.

                                     KATE
                              (sweating)
                         I am!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Dancing should not be work. It should 
                         be a vacation the body takes from 
                         the mind. Let the music wash over 
                         you.

                                     KATE
                              (frustrated)
                         It is!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Repeat after me: I've got the muusic 
                         in me.

                                     KATE
                         I've got the muusic in me.

                                     INSTRUCTOR & KATE
                              (overlapping)
                         I've got the muusic in me!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Keep telling yourself that.

               Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.

               Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.

               LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling 
               couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her 
               imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, 
               muttering to herself, dancing alone.

               INT. LAB - MORNING

               Dr. Kau SLAMS a large book on Dr. Plodder's desk startling 
               him.

                                     DR. KAU
                         I've located her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You didn't! Is she all right?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No. She's really not.

               Photograph of a SWEATSHOP 1896. The conditions are APPALLING. 
               Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, 
               worn out, stares helplessly into the camera.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It was taken a year after she arrived. 
                         Look at her face! We have to get her 
                         back.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Christine, this morning I spoke with 
                         the head of funding. They're talking 
                         about canceling the project.

                                     DR. KAU
                         What?! They can't do that!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         There's still time. Nothing has 
                         happened yet that can't be undone. 
                         We'll get her back. We'll put this 
                         behind us and we'll get her back.

               The doctors stare at the photograph. Powerless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold work at their easels. Leopold sighs 
               HEAVILY.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is there something on your mind?

               There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is rather difficult for me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         ...Uh huh...?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have been in the salon contemplating 
                         the reception I have received by the 
                         various tradesmen I have visited. 
                         I've determined I am lacking the 
                         dexterity of modern intercourse.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Of what??

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Social skills.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I realize our association has been 
                         rather distant and I bear you no ill 
                         will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can imagine my relief.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fact is... I need help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I would appreciate the masculine 
                         point of view.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.

               Leopold looks worried. Charlie puts down his brush.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? Let's see... I guess we could 
                         start by removing that great big 
                         stick from up your... Let's start 
                         with your walk.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My walk?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't walk right.
                              (gently)
                         You strut.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very defensive)
                         STRUT?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Strut strut strut. You walk into the 
                         bathroom it's like I'm watching a 
                         parade. Walk across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You 
                         asked for my help. Trust me on this.

               As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head 
               and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes 
               March. Leopold becomes more and more agitated. As the song 
               crescendos:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That's enough! Really! You walk.

               Charlie hops up, casually walks around the room and begins 
               to hum a more relaxed version of Stars and Stripes.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (between choruses)
                         See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.

               Leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song 
               and mimics Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's better. Now, try to enjoy 
                         your walk. It's a beautiful day. The 
                         sun is shining, the peasants are 
                         singing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               VOICE OVER: Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The Stars 
               and Stripes. As the song builds:

               Charlie enters leading Leopold throughout the room. Leopold 
               matches Charlie EXACTLY step by step so tightly they appear 
               to be one person marching happily about.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Chinatown, Little Italy, chess in Washington Square Park.

               EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

               Leopold and Charlie explore the city. Leopold works diligently 
               on his walk. A beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit. 
               Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Interesting?

               Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles. 
               Charlie pats Leopold on the back. Stops. Pats his back again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, are you wearing a corset?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Naturally.

               Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around 
               Leopold's shoulder. Leopold attempts the same pulls away.

               INT. BLOCKBUSTER RECORDS - NIGHT

               With a headset on, Charlie listens to music. Leopold watches.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What'd ya say was the name of this 
                         number?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty.

               Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's 
               ears. Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song. 
               Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears. His mouth 
               opens wide.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.

               After a bit, Charlie turns the music off. Leopold's shoulders 
               go down but his mouth stays wide open. Astonished.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball 
               hits Leopold squarely on the head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What in the world...?

               A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE. 
               Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.

                                     MAN
                         Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?

                                     WOMAN
                         She's another Babe Ruth. We had no 
                         idea. Are you okay?

               Leopold regards them curiously.

                                     WOMAN
                         What do you have to say for yourself, 
                         Elizabeth?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm sorry!

               Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't 
               speak. After a long moment:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is this your child?

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

               Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at 
               Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     WOMAN
                         C'mon honey, lets go.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I want my ball.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just a moment!
                              (bending down to 
                              Elizabeth, firmly)
                         Pick a hand.

               She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. 
               Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from 
               his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My mother's name was Elizabeth.
                              (then to her parents)
                         She's a beautiful child. You're very 
                         lucky.

                                     MAN
                         What do you say, Elizabeth?

               Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face.

                                     MAN
                         Thank you.

               Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost 
               in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza 
               pies, and pot pies.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand pumpkin pies, pizza 
                         pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone 
                         would explain Eskimo pies.

               He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange 
               a worried look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You smoke Camel's, you wear Old 
                         Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew. 
                         It's revolting.
                              (to Kate)
                         The pudding tonight is excellent. 
                         Another thing I've noticed, everyone 
                         is in a great rush today. Instant 
                         Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, 
                         Minute Maid. You'll find there's 
                         much to be said for moderation and 
                         languor.

               He eats another spoonful.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Mmmm. Is it tapioca?

                                     KATE
                         It's margarine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking the spoon out 
                              of his mouth)
                         It's marvelous.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     KATE
                         Me too. Work to do. Where are you 
                         going?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine. 
                         It's this coffee house we go to.

                                     KATE
                         Say hello to Dennis for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dennis is this really good looking 
                         friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's 
                         alive because SHE doesn't know how 
                         to flirt.

                                     KATE
                         As a rule I don't like to associate 
                         with really good looking people. It 
                         makes me feel really... I don't 
                         know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice 
                         guy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And he always picks up the check.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         That's a wonderful idea! Leopold 
                         mentioned how he wanted to meet... 
                         People of quality was it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ahhhhh?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         If you'd rather I didn't go...

                                     KATE
                         Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to 
                         hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going 
                         to think you don't want him to go.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh it's not that. It's just that 
                         it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. 
                         I'm not sure you'd have such a good 
                         time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A little ribald humor? I'm not as 
                         big a stick in the mud as you might 
                         think! I'd enjoy a gay night out, 
                         kicking up my heels.

               There is an awkward pause. Leopold is so enthusiastic and 
               sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Finish off your Parquet and we'll 
                         go.

               Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house. 
               Charlie looks in the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There they all are. Now one more 
                         thing. Throw the words "like" and 
                         "you know" into a sentence whenever 
                         possible. It's how people talk today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Proper speech does not cease to exist 
                         simply because it is ignored.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Please?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles, you needn't fret. I have 
                         the walk down pat. I will not give 
                         myself away. Like.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looking in the window)
                         Oh shit!
                              (correcting himself)
                         Shoot.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Patrice. See that girl? The blonde 
                         one? She's so inconceivably hot.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Patrice, a tall blonde sits at a large round table, talking. 
               She is very beautiful.

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         She's very pretty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She's mine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Congratulations.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her 
                         first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay. I guess we should go in. I 
                         don't suppose we could tell everyone 
                         you don't speak English?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course not. Let's go inside.

               Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very 
               reluctant Charlie.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie's friends are sitting at a table talking. They are a 
               relaxed and friendly group. Charlie and Leopold approach.

                                     ALL
                              (ad lib greetings)
                         Charlie! Where've you been? etc.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend, 
                         Leo.

                                     BILL
                         Hey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Hey.

                                     DENNIS
                         Waz up?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Waz up?

                                     PATRICE
                         How are ya?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How are ya?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a beat)
                         Leo's staying with us for a while.

               Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next 
               to Patrice instead. Patrice takes out her cigarettes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I?

                                     PATRICE
                         Help yourself.

               Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his 
               own.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you, my dear.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (at a loss)
                         Um?...
                              (all look at Charlie)
                         ...I have nothing to say.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You did not tell the truth about 
                         Patrice, Charles.

                                     DENNIS AND BILL
                         CHARLES??

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I tell you, LEO?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         He informed me you were inconceivably 
                         HOT, but I think you're lovely. 
                         Exceptionally lovely.

                                     PATRICE
                         Thank you, Leo.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to the waitress)
                         Check please.

               INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

               The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and 
               the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the 
               fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the 
               same bench.

               Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at 
               Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Just drop it Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I 
                         am not interested in her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hah!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         In any case the problem is not with 
                         me but with you.
                              (quietly)
                         You have no idea what it takes to go 
                         about courting a woman. From what 
                         I've witnessed tonight, it is 
                         symptomatic of your entire generation.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (almost speechless)
                         You are some piece of work, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now I do not wish to get personal...

               Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old 
               woman. She rolls her eyes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But you have been of great assistance 
                         to me and I feel this is one area 
                         where I can be of some real help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm fascinated. Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now, why was I successful with this 
                         young lady and why did you so 
                         miserably fail?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What makes you think she likes you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well she gave me the number of her 
                         telephone and I assumed it meant...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         As I see it, the girl hasn't an 
                         inkling of your intentions. And it's 
                         no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry 
                         Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A what?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A Merry Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I am not!!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Everything plays like a farce to 
                         you. The more wit, the less courage. 
                         I believe the modern woman desires 
                         passion, protection, sensitivity. No 
                         woman wants to be romanced by a 
                         buffoon.
                              (the old woman shakes 
                              her head)
                         Banter and repartee are fine but you 
                         must add to that a different sort of 
                         playfulness.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think I should pounce?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm saying you must treat her with 
                         respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude 
                         pass. A woman of Kate's stature would 
                         never respond to an artificial tactic.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You said Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I did not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?

               The old woman nods.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We are discussing your problem.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not anymore. You like my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles...

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has trouble with men, you know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she has not met the right 
                         one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has met the right one. HUNDREDS 
                         of times. But she pulls back. She 
                         cuts herself off. You turn around 
                         and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         One never can tell.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does Kate know how you feel?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Have you made your intentions known 
                         to her?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think 
                         you're all talk and no action. What 
                         are you waiting for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I do not know if there is a future 
                         in it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well Leopold, no one ever does...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. 
               She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his 
               closet.

               A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the 
               bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of 
               the bed and starts to read.

                                     KATE
                              (reading out loud)
                         Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out -- 
                         slow soulful kissing... Woman as 
                         equals??

               She flips a page.

                                     KATE
                         Who drove the Chevy to the levy and 
                         why was it dry?

               Kate smiles. She flips the page.

                                     KATE
                         Eyes shine when she talks about... 
                         science. Raises her voice when she 
                         knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, 
                         BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when 
                         I see her smile. Most beautiful when 
                         she's angry. Honorable heart... 
                         Peasant feet.

               The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the 
               notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; 
               glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries 
               from the room.

               INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as 
               Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close 
               together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.

                                     KATE
                         Ooops. Bread and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What's that?

                                     KATE
                         Bread and butter. It's an old 
                         saying... Well not to you I guess. 
                         You say it when you pass someone in 
                         a cramped space. As close as bread 
                         and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         So. Did you have a good time last 
                         night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was very interesting.

                                     KATE
                         Did you find that person of quality?

               Leopold looks at her a moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. I did.

                                     KATE
                         Well... fine.
                              (there is a pause)
                         I guess it's time to turn in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate?

               She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of 
               inaction returns.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodnight.
                              (he slowly closes the 
                              door)

               INT. PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He 
               looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie 
               knocks. She opens the door.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. I brought you some flowers.

               He hands her the flower filled painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         Charlie!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering 
                         if you would do me the great honor 
                         of accompanying me to the cinema 
                         tonight. And allowing me the privilege 
                         of escorting you to dinner afterwards.

               Patrice shyly studies the painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         It's beautiful.

               Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does 
               not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Gracing me with your conversation 
                         and company would mean the world to 
                         me.

               There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.

                                     PATRICE
                         Um... 7:00?

                                     CHARLIE
                         7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.

               They smile at each other for a long moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (silently mouthing)
                         Goodbye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goodbye.
                              (she closes the door)
                         It worked!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course it did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea 
                         what to do next!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles. Leave everything to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast, buddy. You're next.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time 
               and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and 
               doesn't know how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

                                     KATE
                         Good morning. You're up early.

               She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. 
               Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out 
               her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side 
               immediately.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm terribly sorry!!

                                     KATE
                         Happens all the time...

               She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her 
               computer. There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was 
                         wondering...

               She stops working and looks at Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What it is you're working on.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. It's my computer.

               She resumes her work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Actually I meant the work 
                         itself.

                                     KATE
                         I'm researching the correlations 
                         between your time and the present.

               Leopold stares blankly.

                                     KATE
                         I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh.

               Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have never seen a woman work as 
                         diligently and extensively before.

                                     KATE
                         It's made me the man I am today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite a beautiful day, have you 
                         noticed? Perhaps you would permit 
                         yourself some time off and grant me 
                         the privilege of escorting you around 
                         the city this fine Spring afternoon.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've 
                         got too much work to do. Ask Charlie 
                         though. He'll go with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the 
                         same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.

               Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold.

                                     KATE
                              (gently)
                         Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Some other time then.

                                     KATE
                         Yes... Thank you.

               Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment 
               then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. 
               After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with 
               her foot and starts banging on the top of it.

                                     KATE
                         Oh for crying out loud. Would you 
                         look at this? Leopold? The computer's 
                         on the blink again.
                              (she bangs harder)
                         Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Maybe if you...

                                     KATE
                         NO, no, it does this all the time. 
                         Just have to wait it out.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         Darn.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...Perhaps it is a sign?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you think?
                              (she smiles at Leopold)

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate 
               follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.

                                     KATE
                         I... I must have gotten a funny 
                         horse...

               Leopold turns and rides around Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in 
               Sheeps Meadow.

               Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps 
               Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse 
               through the greenery of Central Park.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY

               A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring 
               Ronald Coleman.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

               Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large 
               drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.

               The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He 
               involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's 
               shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that supposed to be my hair? Do 
                         you see how they think my hair looks?

               Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she 
               too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close 
               to him.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza, 
               The Metropolitan Museum.

               EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - DAY

               Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.

               INT. MUSEUM - DAY

               Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white 
               canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.

                                     KATE
                         That's simplicity in it's purest 
                         form. It speaks volumes in it's 
                         nothingness. Whiteness representing 
                         emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak. 
                         Bleak!

               Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next 
               object d'art. A toilet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Aaand this represents...?

               They burst into giddy laughter.

                                     KATE
                         Absolutely nothing.

               They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's 
               smile fades.

               CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.

               Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very quietly)
                         I'd almost forgotten how beautiful 
                         it was. Truly. Beautiful.

               Kate smiles sadly at Leopold. They slowly walk out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as Kate and 
               Leopold enter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (laughing)
                         M & M's, CBS, FBI.

                                     KATE
                         VIP, VHS, VCR.

               They collapse on the couch.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know. K.D. Lang.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I don't know how you keep up with 
                         it. I'm exhausted.

                                     KATE
                         So am I.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll tell you what. Why don't I 
                         prepare dinner tomorrow night? I 
                         never have before. I mean even before 
                         I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I 
                         can't imagine what it'll taste like, 
                         but I don't think it will be any 
                         worse than your cooking.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         A blind date.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, I'm so sorry.

                                     KATE
                         No, that just means I haven't met 
                         him before. It was set up through 
                         friends.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah!

                                     KATE
                         A hazard of single life... I'm turning 
                         in.

               Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Another time then.

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite all right.

               As she gets to the door, she stops.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. 
                         I can't remember the last time I 
                         took the day off and just played. 
                         I'd forgotten how beautiful this 
                         city can be... I want to thank you 
                         for that.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The pleasure was mine.

               Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining 
               room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs 
               into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. 
                         Are you sure you can teach me 
                         everything there is to know?

                                     KATE
                              (from the bathroom)
                         Just don't swipe the silverware and 
                         give yourself away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nobody's talking to you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is very simple. I will be your 
                         date. Just behave as you normally 
                         would and I'll correct you along the 
                         way. Now, escort me in.

               Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, 
               Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. 
               Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom 
               in a tight BLACK dress.

               Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie 
               sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now what?

               Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. 
               Hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         No name calling.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Well, really!

               Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, 
               Charlie pushes the chair in to hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're not shoveling coal into a 
                         furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in 
                         gently. Gently. Try it again.

               Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains 
               standing, not sure what to do next.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, sit down!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now don't burst a vein or anything, 
                         but there are quite a few knives and 
                         forks here. How do I know what each 
                         one's for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Merely start from the outside and 
                         work your way in.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What kind of beer should I order?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Beer!

                                     CHARLIE
                         I WAS KIDDING!

                                     KATE
                         How do I look?

               Leopold and Charlie stand. Kate poses in the gown picked out 
               by Leopold. Leopold smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You look exquisite, Katherine.

                                     KATE
                              (almost sadly)
                         Thank you, Leopold.

               She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is a tie I'm wearing.

                                     KATE
                         You look very nice, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. I know.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     KATE
                         That must be him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your bland date?

                                     KATE
                         Blind date.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't 
                         use to many big words. You'll scare 
                         the poor slob away.

                                     KATE
                              (moving to the door)
                         This is always the scary part.
                              (she sings)
                         "Open the door to my, Mystery Date."

               She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie 
               peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands 
               LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner.

                                     LARRY
                         Hi. Kate?

                                     KATE
                         Larry?

               Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile.

                                     KATE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (giving Larry the 
                              once over)
                         Kate, may I have a word with you?

                                     KATE
                         Now?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.
                              (as they cross the 
                              room)
                         I DON'T like the look of him.

                                     KATE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Cad. I can spot one a mile away.
                              (he helps her with 
                              her coat)
                         I shall escort you out myself. I 
                         will act as your chaperone.

                                     KATE
                         That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is no trouble.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She is gone. Leopold stares after her, dejected.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are led to their table. Larry sits down. Kate 
               remains standing.

                                     LARRY
                              (friendly)
                         Sit down.

                                     KATE
                              (sighs)
                         Thank you.
                              (she sits)

                                     LARRY
                         So. How am I doing?

                                     KATE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     LARRY
                         How am I doing? First date. You 
                         pleased? You disappointed?

                                     KATE
                         Undecided.

                                     LARRY
                         I see.

               He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling 
               Kate. She laughs nervously.

                                     LARRY
                         So. What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     KATE
                         About you? Ah, she said you were 
                         tall.

                                     LARRY
                         6'3.

                                     KATE
                         And nice looking.

                                     LARRY
                         Thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Thank her. And that you persevere 
                         ardently on Wall Street.

                                     LARRY
                         Well, I work there...

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         That must be very interesting.

                                     LARRY
                              (laughing)
                         You've obviously never worked on 
                         Wall Street.

                                     KATE
                              (laughing along for 
                              the hell of it)
                         No.

               Their laughter subsides. After a beat:

                                     LARRY
                         What else did Jeannie say about me?

               INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT

               The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie 
               and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go 
               first just as Leopold has instructed.

               The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a 
               look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the 
               table and takes his seat.

                                     PATRICE
                         Have I told you how much I liked 
                         your painting?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (beaming)
                         Twice.

                                     PATRICE
                         If you get tired of hearing about 
                         it, let me know. I have to admit I 
                         was sort of surprised when you called. 
                         I didn't think you liked me, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When I first saw you, I thought...
                              (he makes his jaw 
                              drop down to the 
                              floor)

                                     PATRICE
                         What do you think now?

               Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he 
               makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are eating their dinner.

                                     KATE
                         Aaand that's about all Jeannie said. 
                         What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     LARRY
                              (smiling)
                         She said you were enormously sexy, 
                         had a great body, but you don't put 
                         out.

                                     KATE
                         Quite a compelling portrait.

                                     LARRY
                              (turning on the charm)
                         Would you say it's an accurate 
                         portrait?

                                     KATE
                              (leaning into Larry)
                         A masterpiece.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room 
               table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while 
               he pours a glass of wine.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.

                                     LARRY
                         So this guy wants to invest $50,000 
                         in a stock that's no good. Here's 
                         what I do...

               Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. 
               She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the 
               proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices 
               her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins 
               to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long 
               while. Finally she looks up at Larry.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY

                                     LARRY
                         I'm telling you the guy was a DICK! 
                         A total ASSHOLE!

                                     KATE
                              (jarred awake)
                         Who?

                                     LARRY
                         Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking 
                         about. Hello?

                                     KATE
                              (realizing her feelings 
                              for Leopold, smiling 
                              radiantly at Larry)
                         Goodbye.

               Then as she leaves, a parting shot.

                                     KATE
                         Don't get up.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living 
               room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               His bedroom is empty. He is not there.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.

               Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of 
               Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. 
               She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is 
               touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Oh!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Bread and butter.

               He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, 
               inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're back early. Did you enjoy 
                         your date?

                                     KATE
                              (happily)
                         No.

               She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.

                                     KATE
                         Here, you've got some...

               He wipes his face making it much worse.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is it gone?

                                     KATE
                              (laughing)
                         No.

               She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each 
               other and become serious.

                                     KATE
                              (softly)
                         A funny thing happened to me on my 
                         bland date this evening, Leopold. I 
                         really can't explain it. This puffed-
                         up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn 
                         kept popping into my mind all night 
                         long at the most inopportune times. 
                         I couldn't get rid of him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How inconsiderate.

                                     KATE
                         Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, 
                         the more persistent he became. He's 
                         conceited and inflated and unseasoned 
                         and it doesn't seem to matter... 
                         He's 134 years old but I can't get 
                         him out of my head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is he there right now?

                                     KATE
                         Right here. Larger than life.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll protect you...

               They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, would you grant me license 
                         to dine with you tomorrow evening at 
                         eight o'clock?

                                     KATE
                         Permission granted.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Until tomorrow, then.

               They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. 
               They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the 
               kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He 
               carries a casserole dish.

               A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing 
               an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little startled)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     KATE
                         YOU do. What have you got there?

               Leopold opens the casserole dish.

                                     KATE
                         Hamburger Helper!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I know you like it.

               Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL 
               MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. 
               This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.

               INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT

               The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow 
               throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful 
               World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me more.

                                     KATE
                         Um, where was I? So after my father 
                         died I had to go to work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you had many jobs?

                                     KATE
                         Many. I got fired from all of them. 
                         I'm the most unskilled person I know. 
                         But they were just survival jobs 
                         while I was still in school. I always 
                         knew I wanted to go into science 
                         like my father. And I did.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I think about him every day. He was 
                         courtly, just like you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I think you are a remarkable woman 
                         Katherine Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You just don't get out much. You'd 
                         be surprised how remarkable I'm not.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No, it is you who would be surprised.

               They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They 
               kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They 
               look at each other, deciding.

               Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

               Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads 
               him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two 
               figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the 
               figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good morning.

                                     PATRICE
                         Morning.

               They kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is 
               set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from 
               the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see 
               each other for the first time.

                                     KATE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

               They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.

                                     KATE
                         Look what you've done!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's nothing.

                                     KATE
                         Nothing? My own mother never made me 
                         a breakfast like this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will have to have a talk with her.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         About last night...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please sit down.

               He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, I had never before been a 
                         considerate man. I had, with 
                         astonishing complacency, squandered 
                         my life, waiting for some incentive 
                         to force me into action. You have 
                         made me see how rare our time here 
                         really is. I am most beholden to you 
                         Kate. And always will be.

                                     KATE
                         I sense the word "BUT" entering into 
                         this any minute now.

               Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, 
               bracing for worst.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming 
                         my wife.

               Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shall I take that as a "yes"?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         That's entirely beside the point... 
                         You're moving way too fast here. 
                         Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's 
                         obvious the first one went well...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where I come from that's pretty much 
                         the way it works.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, even though last night we... 
                         loved each other, that doesn't mean 
                         this morning we're engaged. It just 
                         doesn't work that way now.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking a ring off 
                              his fingers and 
                              placing it on hers)
                         I have loved you since I first set 
                         eyes on you. I cannot imagine my 
                         life without you beside me. I want 
                         to marry you, Kate and make an honest 
                         woman of you.

                                     KATE
                         Oh Leopold, sit down.

               They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.

                                     KATE
                         Relationships these days are much 
                         more complicated than that. Women 
                         today have certain freedoms that men 
                         have been taking advantage of for 
                         centuries. You must have been aware 
                         of that. If you think about it 
                         clearly, it should be obvious to you 
                         that marriage between us is out of 
                         the question.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you not love me Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (almost inaudible)
                         Don't ever think that...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Then consider my proposal.

                                     KATE
                         I'll think it over but I can tell 
                         you now the answer is...

               He kisses her. It's impressive.

                                     KATE
                              (out of breath)
                         Possibly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a knowing smile)
                         I need you beside me. I will not 
                         give up easily.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling)
                         Do what you have to do...

               Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely 
               selfconscious.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD AND KATE
                              (too casual and too 
                              chipper)
                         Morning!

               Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite 
               right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the 
               table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Coffee?

               Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a pause)
                         I would like some coffee.

                                     KATE
                         Of course. Say when.

               She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         When.

                                     KATE
                         Sorry.

               As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He 
               eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.

               Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, 
               looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a 
               beat:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Uh huh.

               All smile privately and sip their coffee without another 
               word.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors 
               in earnest.

               She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes 
               in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and 
               breaks.

                                     DR. KAY
                              (calling from her 
                              office)
                         Kate, are you all right?

                                     KATE
                         Fine! I'm fine.

               She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her 
               mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has 
               SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.

               She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window 
               around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she 
               stares back at the paper on her desk.

               She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of 
               Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her 
               mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.

               Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. 
               She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, 
               she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles 
               away.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. 
               Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at 
               Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles 
               sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She 
               snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock 
               Museum.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On 
               the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun 
               control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Public office is apparently still 
                         the last refuge for the incompetent. 
                         Show me a man who does not want his 
                         gun registered and I'll show you a 
                         man who should not own a gun. What 
                         is a pee-pee girl?

                                     KATE
                         What are you reading?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The Village Voice. After much 
                         consideration, I have decided it is 
                         time I join the work force.

                                     KATE
                         As a pee-pee girl?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps not that, but I am determined 
                         to acquire honest employment.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I don't know if that's such 
                         a good idea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, my life back home was beneficial 
                         to no one. I want my new life to 
                         have value. I won't make the same 
                         mistakes twice.

                                     KATE
                         You have to be patient.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I could conceivably wait my whole 
                         life away.

                                     KATE
                         You're awfully cute when you get 
                         causey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not waste any more time. I 
                         must make a difference.

               INT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY

               Customers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold 
               is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Try our fragrance? Would you like to 
                         try our new fragrance today?

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         What is it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is called, POISON.

               He squirts some at her.

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         Oh! I don't think so. Have you got 
                         PASSION?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I beg your pardon?

                         Next aisle over.

               She leaves. Leopold looks after her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat)
                         Give your mother-in-law what she 
                         really deserves this season. Give 
                         her some POISON.

               INT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING

               The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door.

                                     KATE
                         Hi.
                              (the doctors remain 
                              silent)
                         What's the matter?

               There is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are 
               on to her. She puts down her pen.

                                     KATE
                         So you know.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We had to go through your computer 
                         to access information. Your 
                         calculations have been verified and 
                         the final course has been set. Leopold 
                         goes back a week from Friday 1:17 
                         a.m.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         How long were you going to keep it a 
                         secret, Kate?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Were you even going to tell us at 
                         all?

                                     KATE
                         I'm not sure.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Not sure? What can you be thinking? 
                         You can't alter the course of history 
                         and assume everything will be okay. 
                         It won't be. He has his own destiny 
                         to fulfill in his own time.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         You don't understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (gently)
                         He's going back, Kate.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         It's over.

               Kate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the 
               door. Just the sound of the clock ticking.

               Kate sits at her desk very still.

                                     KATE
                         No... No, no, no.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Charlie knocks and enters.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There you are. I've only been 
                         hollering for the last...

               He sees her face. Kate's eyes are red and swollen. She lays 
               out Leopold's belongings.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate? What is it? What happened?

                                     KATE
                              (very detached)
                         It's time. Leopold's going back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         Yup. I'll get his things together. 
                         Tell him tonight.

               He goes to her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you all right?

                                     KATE
                              (pulling away)
                         I'm fine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't look so fine.

                                     KATE
                         Well I am. It was wonderful having 
                         him here, Charlie. He was of 
                         invaluable assistance to the project.
                              (she shrugs)
                         I'll miss him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'll miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!

               Kate remains silent.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, don't do this. Please. It's 
                         not right.

                                     KATE
                         What am I supposed to DO, Charlie?? 
                         I can't go back. He can't stay. I 
                         can't let him go. I'm not equipped 
                         to deal with this, Charlie. I don't 
                         know how.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be 
                         the ice princess.

                                     KATE
                              (beginning to tear up)
                         I'm not!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You are. You can't live your whole 
                         life under a microscope. You've got 
                         to tell him how you feel.

                                     KATE
                              (breaking down in his 
                              arms)
                         It's too much, Charlie. It's just 
                         too much.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe it to him.

                                     KATE
                         I didn't know I could feel like this. 
                         I really didn't know.

               INT. FANCY FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         So I looked him right in the eye and 
                         said, 'Ego is nature's compensation 
                         for mediocrity.' I turned and I 
                         walked. He never said a word... He 
                         probably didn't understand it... 
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (cold)
                         What?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you all right? You're awfully 
                         quiet.

                                     KATE
                         I'm fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How was your day?

                                     KATE
                              (taking a long pause)
                         It's time.

               Leopold looks at her.

                                     KATE
                         We're sending you back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (slowly pushing his 
                              plate away)
                         When?

                                     KATE
                         A week from Friday, early morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No!

                                     KATE
                         It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out 
                         of our hands. We can't POCKET people 
                         from history like stolen jewels. We 
                         haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll 
                         miss you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that all?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to do, fall apart? 
                         You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't 
                         solve anything.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is this woman sitting across 
                         from me?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to say, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me that you love me as I love 
                         you. Let me hear you say it.

               Kate remains silent. Leopold abruptly throws money on the 
               table.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not do this. I'm sorry.

               We starts out.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold!

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm. 
               His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he 
               winds up walking along Central Park South.

               Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. 
               He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's 
               head.

               He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the 
               skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays 
               his face against the horse's head, torn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee 
               boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her 
               way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the 
               front door, DISHEVELED.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God. Look at you. You look awful.

                                     KATE
                         You should see what I'm looking at.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I went back to the restaurant. They 
                         told me you went out looking for me 
                         right after I left.

                                     KATE
                         That was pound cakes ago. Where were 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I had a lot to think over.

                                     KATE
                         Such as?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just where I stand around here.

               There is a long pause.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         We should have come up with something 
                         together. I might have been spared 
                         ten or seventy pounds.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that an apology?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry for what I said.

               Leopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her 
               hands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     KATE
                         Yes you are...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going. I'm staying here with 
                         you.

                                     KATE
                         But? You can't! We have no right 
                         to...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is my destiny. It is my decision.

                                     KATE
                         Have you thought about what you'd be 
                         sacrificing? Your influence? Your 
                         authority?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Your family, your whole way of life, 
                         everything?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         You're not just feeling sorry for me 
                         because I ate the contents of the 
                         refrigerator, are you?

               They kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate. The single most 
                         miraculous event in my life was not 
                         how I arrived here, but that when I 
                         did, I found you.

                                     KATE
                              (overwhelmed)
                         Here comes the mushy part!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         After much consideration I've come 
                         to the conclusion I no longer desire 
                         a large estate with a full staff and 
                         ornate grounds.

                                     KATE
                         That's good, because if you're staying 
                         I'll probably get fired again. What 
                         do you desire?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A beautiful wife, a small home in 
                         the middle of nowhere, lots of 
                         children, and fine schools with PMS 
                         meetings every other Sunday.

                                     KATE
                         ...PTA?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         PTA.

                                     KATE
                         I love you too. I do, Leopold. I 
                         love you, too.

               They kiss.

               INT. LABORATORY - DAY

               Leopold and Kate sit calm and resolute. The doctors are in 
               an uproar.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         This is outrageous! I won't allow 
                         it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The decision is not yours to make.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Do you realize what you're saying? 
                         You're tampering with fate, 
                         preordinance, and God himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We do that every day, doctor. It is 
                         called CHOICE.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Dr. Carlson is still over there. You 
                         can't simply abandon her. We have to 
                         get her back.

                                     KATE
                         Do you think I'm not aware of that? 
                         Do you think a minute goes by that I 
                         don't feel responsible for her? But 
                         SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Only one person can return. The 
                         capsule accommodates only one person. 
                         Leopold has to find her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she does not wish to return. 
                         Perhaps she's found greater happiness 
                         in her new life. It happened to me.

                                     KATE
                         Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe 
                         she's of more important use back 
                         there.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Julia Carlson died in the Center 
                         Factory fire of 1897, two years after 
                         she arrived. She was 37 years old.

               There is a stunned silence.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Dear lord.

                                     DR. KAU
                         She was a friend, Kate. She was never 
                         expected to sacrifice her life for 
                         this experiment. I won't be a party 
                         to it. I know what I'm asking... 
                         There's no way we can force you to 
                         go. Just think it over.

               INT. BEDROOM - 2:30 A.M.

               A clock is ticking loudly. Kate and Leopold lie back to back.

                                     KATE
                         You're going back aren't you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I keep seeing that poor woman's face. 
                         She was terrified.

                                     KATE
                         You said you wouldn't leave me... 
                         I've never been lucky. Not one time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Six months ago I wouldn't have given 
                         it another thought. I wouldn't have 
                         lost a moment's sleep. You've changed 
                         me, Kate. There is no turning back.

                                     KATE
                         I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's 
                         what's tearing me up inside. Either 
                         way I lose... You've changed me too. 
                         I can't go back to my old life 
                         anymore. I can't live like that again. 
                         God my heart is pounding like a drum. 
                         I've never been so scared in my life. 
                         Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take 
                         me with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You don't realize what you're saying! 
                         You don't understand the kind of 
                         life you'd lead. What you'd be giving 
                         up.

                                     KATE
                         I'd be with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't ask that of you.

                                     KATE
                         Just ask me... Just ask.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Come back with me.

               She slowly turns. She embraces him.

                                     KATE
                         Yes!

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - NIGHT

               Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through 
               the street. She is clumsier than usual.

                                     KATE
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is something I've wanted to do 
                         for a long time.

               She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign: 
               ROSELAND.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This will be very therapeutic.

               He takes her arm and escorts her in.

               INT. ROSELAND - NIGHT

               Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and 
               Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls 
               her close.

               This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they 
               shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more 
               than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold 
               holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest 
               time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING

               Large screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold, 
               and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly 
               time.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         The time tables have been set. Just 
                         strap yourself in and you'll be fine.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You have only a twenty four hour 
                         leeway before the machine is set to 
                         return to us. You must find Carlson 
                         within that time frame and get her 
                         on board or there will be little 
                         chance of her finding a way back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's been a real pleasure. You have 
                         a much nicer smile than Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The privilege was mine.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.
                              (she gives him a kiss)

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, my.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you... 
                         as soon as possible. I'll see to it 
                         myself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         See that you do.

                                     DR. KAU
                         You have my word on it.

               The doctors leave.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Four minutes and counting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.

               He sticks out his hand.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodbye.
                              (impulsively Leopold 
                              embraces Charlie)
                         I shall miss you Charles, more than 
                         you know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're 
                         the only one who knows how to program 
                         the VCR... Take care of my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will.

                                     CARLSON
                         You better. Take care of yourself 
                         too while you're at it... So long.

                                     KATE
                         I don't have any words for this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will see you soon.

                                     KATE
                         I know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You'll be with me all the time.

                                     KATE
                         I know. I brought you something.

               She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger.

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't forget me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't think this was all a 
                         dream.

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Don't forget about me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Wait for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         For as long as it takes.

                                     KATE
                         I will come back to you! I will!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll be waiting.

               They kiss again for the last time.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's time Leopold.

               Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they 
               part.

               Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself 
               in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against 
               the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her 
               hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.

               After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder 
               silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         9 8 7 6 5 4...

               Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's, 
               his hand still against the glass.

               Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         3 2 1!

               Dr. Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold. Leopold pulls 
               the lever, still gazing at Kate. There is a blinding FLASH 
               of light, then darkness.

               INT. LAB - MONTHS LATER

               Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the 
               doctors.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         I cannot in good conscience let you 
                         go. It's out of the question.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         I can't be a part of it either Kate. 
                         I'm sorry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It's too big a risk.

               Kate rises and moves to the window. She is a full NINE MONTHS 
               PREGNANT.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         We cannot guarantee your child's 
                         safety. It's that simple.

                                     KATE
                         He's waiting for me. I can feel it. 
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She gazes out the window, searching the horizon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SMALL FARM HOUSE - EVENING

               Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old, 
               rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as 
               puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up 
               in her car.

                                     CARLSON
                         Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.
                              (yelling inside)
                         MOM??

                                     CARLSON
                         You're Leo aren't you? You don't 
                         remember me but I knew you when you 
                         were yea big.
                              (she holds her hands 
                              an inch apart)

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your 
                         mothers.

                                     LEO
                              (proudly)
                         We had spaghetti at our house 4 times 
                         this week.

               Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.

                                     KATE
                         Leo you don't have to holler like 
                         that. I'm not deaf...

                                     CARLSON
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                         ...Carlson?!

               The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.

                                     KATE
                         Carlson, I don't believe it. It's 
                         been... I don't know how many years. 
                         What are you doing here.

                                     CARLSON
                         I came to see you, sweetie.

                                     KATE
                         You remember my son, Leo?

                                     CARLSON
                         We've just been getting acquainted.

                                     KATE
                         Well, come inside. Come inside.

               INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living 
               room before joining her.

               Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is 
               furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.

                                     KATE
                              (covering her agitation)
                         Would you like some tea? I wish you 
                         had called before you come over. It 
                         would have given me a chance to 
                         straighten up the house... myself... 
                         my life. Tell me what you've been up 
                         to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard 
                         you received some big endowment or 
                         something. I was going to write, 
                         then call, but...

               She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently 
               she has to put it down.

                                     CARLSON
                         It's all right, Kate. I understand.

               There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                         You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a 
                         lot of time to get your affairs in 
                         order... And I warn you, it's nearly 
                         impossible for an intelligent woman 
                         back there.

               Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would 
                         be proud. We're aware of your 
                         situation but we felt when the time 
                         came, you deserved the option.

               Kate nods, trembling slightly.

               INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off.

                                     LEO
                         Who was that lady?

                                     KATE
                         Just an old friend.

                                     LEO
                         What she want?

                                     KATE
                              (she looks at Leo)
                         Nothing important. You brush your 
                         teeth?

               Leo shows off his teeth.

                                     KATE
                         Then give your old mom a hug and go 
                         to bed.
                              (Leo gives her a hug 
                              and a kiss)
                         Good night, cookie.

                                     LEO
                         Good night.

               Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the 
               house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear 
               are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.

               She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits 
               down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in 
               thought.

               She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls 
               out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHOTO ALBUM

               Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, 
               magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.

               A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he 
               departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for 
               a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It 
               is the same ring Kate gave him.

               A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to 
               establish a scientific center researching studies in time 
               and space.

               A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, 
               marching to give women the vote.

               A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, 
               stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing 
               to his ring.

               A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing 
               a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded 
               by academia and subtly points to his ring.

               A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with 
               Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.

               A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting 
               regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one 
               hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against 
               his chest, showing off the ring.

               An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in 
               bombings.

               A tear falls on the page.

               Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera 
               follows her gaze past her property...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER

               LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time 
               as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, 
               older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.

               Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, 
               approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.

                                     KATE
                         He's so YOUNG, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's old enough.

                                     KATE
                         Look at that idiotic expression on 
                         his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's happy.

                                     KATE
                         Of course he's happy. All weddings 
                         are happy. It's the living together 
                         afterwards that causes all the 
                         trouble.

               Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet 
               hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.

               Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, 
               over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the 
               guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, 
               Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.

               Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. 
               Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not 
               wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you're so young... I love you, 
                         Leo. Always remember that...

               From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries.

                                     LEO
                         Mom, we're only moving to Denver.

                                     KATE
                         I know, cookie. I know.

               INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

               From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console. 
               A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the 
               darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps 
               herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the 
               lab.

                                     KATE
                         Well...

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. Me too.

               They embrace each other for the last time.

                                     KATE
                         What will I do without you, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (softly)
                         Live happily ever after.

                                     CARLSON
                              (pushing the intercom 
                              button)
                         Kate, it's time.

                                     LEO
                              (emotionally)
                         Here. It's a letter for my father. 
                         Tell him about me and... um, tell 
                         him I love him. I want him to know 
                         me.

                                     KATE
                         Leo...

                                     LEO
                         Mom, I want you to go.

                                     KATE
                         But...

               He puts his finger to her lips. He looks to his wife then 
               back at Kate. He nods his head.

                                     LEO
                         Go.

               They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the 
               moment.

                                     CARLSON
                         Ready!

               Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, 
               the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson 
               raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:

                                     CARLSON
                         9, 8, 7...

               Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. 
               She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, 
               staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         3, 2, 1!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand 
               there motionless, stunned.

               The screen is BLACK.

               EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT

               A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. 
               A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, 
               stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The 
               creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, 
               rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses 
               a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance 
               floor.

               In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very 
               distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young 
               woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.

                                     FLIRT
                              (brushing his shirt 
                              front)
                         I just love a starched white shirt. 
                         It's so elegant.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                         Skeeky.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. You dance like an angel Miss 
                         Beall. You light up the room around 
                         you. I thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                              (with a big smile)
                         Thank YOU.

               The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a 
               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the 
               staircase.

               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every 
               turn as Kate searches each male face.

               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up 
               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up 
               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, 
               flouncing down the stairs.

               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks 
               for Leopold.

               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. 
               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns 
               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.

               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then 
               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold 
               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at 
               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her 
               his hand.

               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their 
               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT 
               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her 
               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. 
               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment 
               of youth, when they fell in love.

               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He 
               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands 
               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he 
               wraps his arms tightly around her.

               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes 
               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count 
               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.

               THEY DANCE...

               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.

                                     LORD WHITEHEAD
                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?

                                     LADY WHITEHEAD
                         I've never seen her before.

               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze 
               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.

               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The 
               rest of the world dances around them.

               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO 
               SCREEN.

               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate 
               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly 
               point to their rings.

               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for 
               studies in physics.

               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to 
               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.

               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It 
               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching 
               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly 
               into the camera, they show off their rings.

               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...

               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost 
               in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...

          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one
          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight
          with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.

                         QUICK IMAGES:

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves
          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get
          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes
          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It
          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.
          Beer is around.

                         

          EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - A DIFFERENT DAY

           Well, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.

                          DEBBIE
           You didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           I did. And then I wrote it on the
           calendar like you told me to.

                          DEBBIE
           No, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           I did tell you.

           Well, you didn't, but what are we
           going to do? Because I have an
           appointment so you're taking the kids
           to school.
          Pete holds Charlotte in front of him.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Don't use the baby to cover your
           tracks.

                          ALISON

           Great. Good. You turned my sister into
           a limo driver.

                          ALISON
           I don't mind.

          INT. ALLISON'S CAR - DAY

          Alison drives the kids to school. Charlotte and Sadie sit in the

                          SADIE

           You Googled "murder?"

                          SADIE
           Yeah.

                          ALISON
           Why? I mean what did it say?

                          SADIE
           It didn't say anything. It just showed
           pictures of people lying dead on the
           floor and...blood everywhere and
           ugh...

                          ALISON
           That was just ketchup.

                          (BEAT)

                          SADIE

           Well, I got your baby!

           KNOCKED UP - 4.

                         
          Charlotte WHINES.

                          ALISON
           Don't taunt her. Come on.

                          SADIE

           She hit me.

                          ALISON
           Did you hit her?

                          SADIE
           I did not.

                          ALISON
           Make her happy.

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)
           It's okay.

                          SADIE
           It won't make her happy. She spilled
           all the marbles on the floor.

                          ALISON
           Well, give her her marbles back.

                         

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          In a living room of the house the guys have created an office for
          their web site. There are a few large tables, several computers
          which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on
          them. Ben and his friends are holding a meeting. They each have a
          note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint
          and drink beers.

                          JASON
           All right? Now, are you sure you
           understand the terms of the bet?
           `Cause this is serious.

                          MARTIN
           Oh, no.

                          JASON
          Martin, listen. You don't shave your
          beard or cut your hair for one year,
          and if you can do that, I will pay
          your rent. But if you shave, then you
          have to pay all five of our rents.

                          MARTIN
          Thanks for the free money, bitch.

                          JONAH
          Hey, Martin, was it weird when you
          joined the Taliban, being American and
          everything like that? Like when you
          see a woman driving a car, do you just
          get pissed?

                          JASON
          Just watch your back, Serpico. You
          never know who your friends are.

                          MARTIN
          You guy can't make fun of the me the
          whole time.

                          JASON
          But, Martin, it's a competition. It's
          called "The Dirty Man Competition."
          We're gonna make fun of you until you
          shave the beard. That's the rules.

                          JAY
          That's the whole point. You're
          supposed to be tempted into shaving.

                          BEN
          Your face looks like Robin Williams'
          knuckles.

                          MARTIN
          You guys aren't allowed to make fun of
          me. It's not part of the rules.

                          JASON
          Martin, why didn't you just listen to
          me when I was explaining the rules?
          You just looked at me with that blank
          stare of yours. It was like talking to
          a wax statue.

                          BEN
          Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only
          at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will
          customers be able to find exactly how
          long into what movies their favorite
          stars are exposed."

                          JASON
          Nice.

                          JAY
          Oh, fuckin' booya.

           Guys, let's start loggin', all right?
           Charles Manson? Do you have any other
           thoughts?

           Good, awesome, let's start this off
           with a bang. Jamie Lee Curtis. I got
           an hour and ten minutes in "Trading

                          JAY
           Ah, I got something. A three-titted
           alien from "Total Recall?"

          She's about to pull in.

          Is she camera-ready?

          If she's going to be in hair and
          makeup for three hours. I can't do it.
          I'm not going to be here. I got to do
          "American Idol." It's live. I got to
          do it. I got to be there. What are we
          going to interview her about?

                          ALISON
          Nothing personal.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          No personal questions.

                          ALISON
          No personal questions. Don't ask her
          about her sister and her nose job.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          No plastic surgery questions.

                          ALISON
          She doesn't want to talk about her
          boobs or her father's comments about
          her boobs.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          Great. We'll talk about the Middle
          East and maybe an idea of an exit
          strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch.
          Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe
          have her point it out to us on a
          globe? I don't understand the young
          talent in this town! It doesn't make
          any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm
          more famous than half the people we
          talk to anyway! No one stands up. No
          one has the balls to sit them down and
          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But
          everybody works for `em. They're all
          on the payroll. They're all sucking
          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-
          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the
          shit." And all these stars just to
          fuck it up. That's what they do. They
          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!
          And now I'm sweating.

                          ALISON
          You know what? You want us to just
          come and get you when she gets here?
          You want to head to the green room for
          a minute? Just chill out?

                          RYAN SEACREST

                          RYAN SEACREST
           No.

                          ALISON
           You want a cookie?

                          RYAN SEACREST
           Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.

                          ALISON
           Okay, we'll get you a cookie.

                          RYAN SEACREST
           I'm sorry I'm pissy.
          JILL, one of the E! executives, approaches Alison.

                          JILL
           Alison?

                          ALISON
           Yeah?

                          JILL
           Jack and I need to see you in his
           office.

                         

          INT. JACK'S OFFICE, E! ENTERTAINMENT - DAY

          Allison's boss, JACK, early forties, is at his desk. Alison and
          Jill sit in the office.

                          JACK
           Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we
           wanted to talk to you today because we
           had a little debate on the conference
           call with New York about you.

                          ALISON
           You were talking about me?

                          JACK
           We were wondering aloud to one another
           whether or not you would be good for
           on-camera.

                          ALISON
           What'd you decide?

                          JILL
           They decided that they like you. And
           they would like to put you on camera.

                          ALISON
           Really?

                          JILL
           I know. I was so surprised, too.

           KNOCKED UP - 9.

                         

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God. This is the best news
          ever. Thank you so much. This is
          great!

                          JACK
          Congratulations.

                          ALISON
          Thank you.

                          JACK
          I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll
          do it."

                          ALISON
          Absolutely. I'm so excited. Oh, my
          God.

                          JILL
          It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see
          what happens. It's going to be tough.
          Tough job.

                          JACK
          About the work, most immediately,
          there's going to be some things that
          you're going to be able to get that
          other people in the office don't get.
          One of them: Gym membership.

                          ALISON
          You want me to lose weight?

                          JACK
          I don't want you to lose weight.

                          JILL
          We can't legally ask you to do that.

                          JACK
          We didn't say lose weight.

                          JILL
          No.

                          JACK
          I might say "tighten."

                          ALISON
          "Tight."

                          JACK
          A little...tighter?

                          JILL
          Just like toned and smaller.

                          JACK
          Don't make everything smaller. I don't
          want to generalize that way. Tighter.

                          JILL
          We don't want you to lose weight. We
          just want you to be healthy.

           KNOCKED UP - 10.

                         

                          ALISON
           Okay.

                          JILL
           You know, by, by eating less. We would
           just like it if you...go home and step
           on the scale and write down how much
           you weigh and subtract it by, like,
           twenty.

                          ALISON
           Twenty.

                          JILL
           And then weigh that much.

                          JACK
           Just remember, you've got it here,
           you've got it here, and everybody's
           going see you right there.

                         

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison hug. Pete is on the couch wearing headphones.

           Yay! That's so exciting!

                          ALISON
           Yay!

                          DEBBIE
           Oh my god!

                          (TO PETE)
           Hey!

                          PETE
           Huh?

                          ALISON
           I got a promotion.

                          PETE
           Oh, congratulations!

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

                          PETE
           Hey, maybe you can get your own place
           now.

                          ALISON
           Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
           Yay!

                          DEBBIE
           Let's go celebrate.

                          ALISON
           Okay, let's do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 11.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Pete'll watch the kids?

                          PETE
           Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab
           Confessions."

                          DEBBIE
           What are you going to do?

                          ALISON
           I don't know!
          Debbie and Alison SHRIEK.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm so excited.

                          ALISON
           Yay!

                         

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie drive to a nightclub.

                          DEBBIE
           I walked in on him masturbating one
           night.

                          ALISON
           Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the-
           headlights look? Did he freeze or did
           he finish?

                          DEBBIE
           No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't
           doing anything under the covers.

                          ALISON
           Oh, no!

                          DEBBIE
           I buy these nice towels and he whacks
           off into them.

                          ALISON
           "Deb and Pete forever"

                          DEBBIE
           And once he does that into them once,
           they're never soft ever again.

                         

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie are walking over.

                          DEBBIE
           I can always tell if I'm looking good
           based on whether or not we get in.
          They reach the front. The Bouncer looks at them and waves them
          in.

           KNOCKED UP - 12.

                         

                          BOUNCER
           Ladies?

                          ALISON
           Guess we're looking good.

                          DEBBIE
           If I didn't get in, I would have lost
           my shit.
          Ben and the guys are standing at the head of the line.

                          BEN
           What's going on man? How long you
           gonna make us wait out here, for
           Christ's sake?

                          JAY
           Come on! What the fuck!

                         

          INT. NIGHTCLUB

          Ben sits with his friends, Jason, Jonah, Jay, and Martin.

                          BEN
           You know what movie I just saw again
           the other day which is fucking, like,
           mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it
           since it came out? "Munich."

                          JAY
           "Munich!"

                          JONAH
           Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.

                          JAY
           "Munich" is awesome!

                          BEN
           That movie was Eric Bana kicking
           fuckin' ass!
          They all agree.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the
           ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it
           on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.

                          JONAH
           Not only killing, but fuckin', like,
           takin' names.

                          BEN
           If any of us get laid tonight, it's
           because of Eric Bana in "Munich."

                          JONAH
           I agree with that.

                          JAY
           I agree.

           KNOCKED UP - 13.

                         

                          BEN
           You know what is not helping us get
           laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard
           Reid, over here at our table. I like
           your shoes.

                          JONAH
           How was "Burning Man" this year?

                          BEN
           Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not
           Jewish.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           So are we.

                          MARTIN
           Fine. Screw it.

                          BEN
           You weren't "chosen" for a reason.

                          JAY
           Yeah. Ahh!

                          JASON
           Ohh!!!
          Meanwhile, Debbie and Alison head for the bar.

                          DEBBIE
           It's like everyone in here is twelve
           years old.
          Debbie SIGHS.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          DEBBIE
           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON
           No, of course not.

                          DEBBIE
           Does it look weird that I'm here?

                          ALISON
           No, not at all.

                          DEBBIE
           Am I hotter than these little bitches?

                          ALISON
           Yes! You look amazing.

                          DEBBIE
           Guys in here would fuck me, right?

           KNOCKED UP - 14.

                         

                          ALISON
           Yes.

                          DEBBIE
           That's weird to say, but, it makes me
           feel better.

                          ALISON
           You look hot.

                          DEBBIE
           I believe you.

                          ALISON
           I'm getting us drinks.
          Alison leaves for the bar.

                         

          INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Ben is already at the bar attempting to get the BARTENDER's
          attention.

                          BEN
           Yo, a beer over here, please? You're
           gonna be embarrassed when you realize
           I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.

                          ALISON
           (to the Bartender)
           Oh, Hey! Excuse me!

                          BEN
           He's literally ignoring this entire
           half of the bar. Don't even bother.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, awesome.

                          BEN
           A beer over here, please? He looked at
           us! Did you see that?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, that was rough.

                          BEN
           And if you can't get service, what am
           I gonna do, you know?

          money on the bar.
           BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           There you go.

           Thank you.

                          BEN
           Okay, enjoy it.

           Are you sure?

                          BEN
           I'm sure. I tried that once before at
           The Comedy Store and I got punched in
           the ear.

                          ALISON
           Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm
           supposed to get one for my sister.

                          BEN
           Oh, here, take mine.
          Ben hands Alison his beer.

           What's up, daddy?

                          BEN
           That girl. She, she totally gave me an
           opening, man, and I locked up. I just
           want to get shit-faced, though, you
           know? I'll just jerk it later. It's
           cool.

                          JASON
           Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She
           looks...smart. Who's that she's
           sitting with?

                          BEN
           It's her sister.

                          JASON
           Her sister?

                          BEN

           Why?

           Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with

           Come on, man. I'm getting it from all

                          JONAH
           I know, I don't either. Was it weird
           when you changed your name from Cat
           Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

                          MARTIN
           Yeah, it was really awkward.

                          JONAH
           All right, man. I got to take off. See
           ya, "Scorsese on coke."
          Jay GROWLS loudly.

           She's married.

                          (TO ALISON)
           Why do you have to say that?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          JASON
           It's a shame. You're beautiful.

                          DEBBIE
           Thank you.

                          ALISON
           She has two kids, too.

                          DEBBIE
           Shut up!

                          ALISON
           What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

                          BEN
           You think that's gonna stop him from
           hitting on her? It's not, at all.

                          JASON
           I love kids.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

           Hello?

           Cool phone.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

                          DEBBIE
           (into the phone)
           What? Is it a rash or is it the
           chicken pox? I don't know! Google it.
           Okay. All right, bye.
           (to Alison et al)
           I got to go. Sadie might have the
           chicken pox.

                          JASON
           I had the chicken pox three times. I
           have no immunity to it.

                          BEN
           We don't have the heart to tell him
           it's herpes.

                          JASON
           It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

                          DEBBIE

           Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so
           I'll just hang out.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

                          DEBBIE
           Be safe.

                          ALISON

           Ben and Alison dance, clearly pretty drunk now. We see Ben's
          friends in the background, also dancing. Ben pretends to throw
          dice while dancing.

           Dude, I think he's doing the dice

           That's really all he's got.
           Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through

           You're prettier than I am.
          They continue to make out.

           Do you have a condom?

           I almost got it. Just give me a

          Ben throws the condom on the floor and rolls over onto Alison.

           Good thing I'm drunk. This is lasting

                          ALISON
           Seven-thirty.

                          BEN
           Why the fuck are we awake? Let's go
           back to sleep.

                          ALISON
           I have to go to work.

                          BEN
           Really?

                          ALISON
           Do you need to get to work or
           anything?

                          BEN
           No work today. Do you want to get
           breakfast?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

           KNOCKED UP - 24.

                         

          EXT. GUEST HOUSE - MORNING

          Alison and Ben walk to their cars. Suddenly Pete walks out of the
          house with the kids.

                          ALISON
           `Morning.

                          PETE
           Good morning Alison.

                          BEN
           I'm Ben. What's happenin', man?

                          PETE
           Ben.

                          BEN
           How's it goin'?
          Pete shakes Ben's hand and smiles.

                          PETE

                          (PLAYFULLY)
           Ah, to be young.

                          ALISON
           Stop it.

                          PETE
           You stop it.

                          ALISON
           See ya later.

                          BEN
           All righty.

                          PETE
           See ya later. Enjoy the day.

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)
           Never do what they did.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I'm gonna do it.

                          PETE
           You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home-
           schooled.

                         

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Alison is in the booth. Ben emerges from the bathroom.

                          BEN
           Whew. I just yacked, something nasty.
           I feel way better, though. I think
           that's the secret. You just gotta
           puke. Did you puke?

                          ALISON
           No.

           KNOCKED UP - 25.

                         

                          BEN
          You can. I won't think it's gross or
          anything.

                          ALISON
          I'm fine.

                          BEN
          Oh, okay.

                          ALISON
          I just need some coffee, so...

                          BEN
          You know, the best thing for a
          hangover's weed. Do you smoke? Do you
          smoke weed?

                          ALISON
          Not really.

                          BEN
          You don't?

                          ALISON
          No.

                          BEN
          At all?

                          ALISON
          Mm-mm.

                          BEN
          Like in the morning?

                          ALISON
          No, I just don't.

                          BEN
          It's the best medicine. `Cause it
          fixes everything. Jonah broke his
          elbow once. We just got high and, it
          still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay.

                          ALISON
          Right.

                          BEN
          Yeah. Last night was great...what I
          remember of it?

                          ALISON
          Right, yeah.

                          BEN
          Yeah.

                          ALISON
          We had a great time.

                          BEN
          Yeah. So what do you do?

           KNOCKED UP - 26.

                         

                          ALISON
          I work at E!

                          BEN
          The television channel?

                          ALISON
          Uh-huh, remember?

                          BEN
          Wow.

                          ALISON
          We had, we had this conversation last
          night. I, I told you about my
          promotion and I was out celebrating
          it. No?

                          BEN
          I don't remember that at all.

                          ALISON
          I'm super excited about it. I'm
          actually doing my first on-air
          interview today.

                          BEN
          With who?

                          ALISON
          Matthew Fox.

                          BEN
          Matthew Fox from "Lost?"

                          ALISON
          Yeah.

                          BEN
          You know what's interesting about him?

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          Nothing. Will you tell him he's an
          asshole for me?

                          ALISON
          No.

                          BEN
          Someone needs to. Like who gives a
          shit?

                          ALISON
          I hope a lot of people actually
          because that's what my job entails, is
          making sure people care about what he
          has to say. I'm interviewing him.

                          BEN
          Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't
          give a shit. I'm just saying he
          deserves a beat down.

           KNOCKED UP - 27.

                         

                          ALISON
          It's sort of embarrassing to ask at
          this point, but what do you do for
          work?

                          BEN
          Me and my roommates have
          started...we're starting an Internet
          website.

                          ALISON
          Oh, cool, what is it?

                          BEN
          I'll give you the virtual experience
          okay? How's that? You're at your
          computer. Who's an actress you like?

                          ALISON
          Mary Tyler Moore?

                          BEN
          No, that does not work at all. Let's
          say you love Meg Ryan.

                          ALISON
          I do.

                          BEN
          Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like
          her so much, you want to know every
          movie where she shows her tits. And
          not just that, but how long into that
          movie she shows her tits. Come to our
          web page, exclusively, type in `Meg
          Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight
          minutes in, forty-eight minutes in,
          like an hour and ten minutes in. She's
          like naked that whole fuckin' movie.
          She does full-frontal in that movie.

                          ALISON

                          (DISGUSTED)
          Wow.

                          BEN
          They should have called her Harry, not
          Sally.

                          ALISON
          Really.

                          BEN
          I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg
          Ryan's bush.

                          ALISON

                          (EXASPERATED)
          Okay.

                          BEN
          Cool.

                          ALISON
          I actually need to get going, so.

           KNOCKED UP - 28.

                         

                          BEN
           Awesome. Can I get your number?
          Alison is incredulous.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           We had fun, right? We should hook up
           again.

                          ALISON
           I'm gonna give you my card because
           that'll be the best way...

                          BEN
           If you want to contact me, I don't
           have a cell right now because of
           payment complications, but you can
           email me at the web page, I check it.
           It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one
           word, dot com.
          Alison gets out of the booth. Ben gets up too.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           So, awesome.

                          ALISON
           All right then. Nice to meet you.
          Ben puts his arms out for a hug. Alison complies. Ben kisses the
          air.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           Take care.

                          BEN
           Okay, uh, see ya.
          Alison exits the diner.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Bye!

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           That was fuckin' brutal. Yeah, that
           was brutal.

          INT. E ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Alison is standing on stage with JAMES FRANCO.

           Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here
           today with James Franco from "Spider
           Man."

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           How are you?

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Great.

           Thanks for coming.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Of course.

                          ALISON
           Tell me, were you a big fan...
          Alison GULPS and appears uncomfortable.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           ...I'm sorry, let me take that again.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Tell me, were you a big fan of the
           comic books growing up?

                          JAMES FRANCO
           No, actually, I didn't read any of the
           comic books until I got the movie.
          Alison stares at the floor looking ill. She breathes heavily.
           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
           Are you okay?

                          ALISON
           Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the
           comic books? Keep talking.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Like I said I really wasn't into them,
           but now that I did the research, I
           think they're pretty amazing.
          Alison runs offstage and VOMITS into a trash can. Repeatedly.
           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
           What the fuck?
          Alison continues to puke.

                         

          INT. EDITING BAY

          Alison and her editor, BRENT, are watching the Franco/puking
          clips.

                          BRENT
           Is that the sound of you puking?

           JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR)
           If this is one of those fuckin' joke
           shows, I'm not into it.

                          BRENT
           We should put this on YouTube.

                          ALISON
           Shut up.

           KNOCKED UP - 30.

                         

                          BRENT
           This is hilarious.

                          ALISON
           You're an asshole.

                          BRENT
           Look how sweaty you are. You look like
           Dom DeLuise.

                          ALISON
           I don't need to see it again. It's
           gonna make me throw up.

                          BRENT
           You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
          Brent HISSES like Jabba the Hutt.

                          ALISON
           You're such an asshole.

                          BRENT
           I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix
           this. No problem.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this
           out and we can re--
          Alison swallows hard.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           --we can reshoot my questions.
          Alison looks ill again.

                          BRENT
           What's up?
          Alison is frantically looking for a place to vomit.
           BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over
           here. Not on the mixing board, not on
           the mixing board.
          Alison finds the trash and VOMITS.

                          BRENT (CONT'D)
           Are you okay?

                          ALISON
           Oh my god. Oh my god.

                          BRENT
           Are you sick?

                          ALISON
           I don't know.

                          BRENT
           What'd you eat?

           KNOCKED UP - 31.

                         

                          ALISON
           I haven't eaten today yet.

                          BRENT
           You haven't eaten yet?

                          ALISON
           Do you have a napkin or something?
          Brent grabs a stray piece of paper.

                          BRENT
           Here, here. What do you have, like the
           flu?

                          ALISON
           I don't know.

                          BRENT
           God, I hope you're not pregnant.

                          ALISON
           It's impossible. You have to have sex
           to get pregnant.
          Alison reacts with a sad realization. Brent picks up the phone.

                          BRENT
           (into the phone)
           B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison
           just puked. Dude, that's what I said.
           She's probably pregnant, right?

                          ALISON
           Oh, shit.

                          BRENT
           (into the phone)
           How does she look right now? She looks
           like she just realized that she's
           pregnant.

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison are sitting on the bed.

                          ALISON
           No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That
           was what, eight weeks ago?

                          DEBBIE
           Did you miss your period?

                          ALISON
           No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't
           know. I can't remember. I was, I mean,
           I've been really stressed at work. I
           can't remember my last period.

                          DEBBIE
           Are you the lady who doesn't realize
           she's pregnant until she's sitting on
           the toilet and a kid pops out?

           KNOCKED UP - 32.

                         

                          ALISON
           Can you not joke right now? Don't joke
           right now. This is really serious.

                          DEBBIE
           Did I meet him?

                          ALISON
           Yeah. You know, he was kind of like
           medium height, sort of...chubby.
           Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

                          DEBBIE
           With the man boobs.

                          ALISON
           Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on
           my phone.
          Alison takes out her phone to play a video.

           BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO)
           Hey! I live in your phone! This is the
           best night of my life! I gotta pee.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh god. How did this happen?

                          ALISON
           Oh, shit.

                          DEBBIE
           Well there's only one way to find out.

                         

          INT. DRUG STORE

          Alison and Debbie run down the aisles looking for pregnancy tests.

                          DEBBIE
           They're here! Here they are! Over
           here!
          Every test on the shelf is pulled into their basket.

                          ALISON
           Okay. "Positive Choice."

                          DEBBIE
           "Easy, One, Two, Three."
          They run toward the check out counter.

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          They dump all the tests on the floor. Alison sits on the toilet
          and rips one test open. She puts the applicator between her legs.

                          ALISON
           Here. Hurry up now. Come on.
          The test reads positive.

           KNOCKED UP - 33.

                         

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           Get more! Get me a few more!

                          DEBBIE
           Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"
          Alison furiously drinks some juice.

                          ALISON
           I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait.
          They check another test.

                          DEBBIE
           Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think
           that's bad.

                          ALISON
           How long does this one take?

                          DEBBIE
           These can't all be positive. Let me
           try one.
          Pete enters to see Debbie sitting on the toilet. Debbie urinates
          on the test and checks it.

                          ALISON
           God, you really had to pee.
          Debbie picks up a test. It's positive.

                          DEBBIE
           What is this? What the hell is this?

                          ALISON
           I think you picked up the wrong one.

                          DEBBIE
           Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.
          Alison glares at Debbie.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. That scared me.

                         

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

          Alison is on a chaise lounge. Debbie is sitting nearby.

                          ALISON
           It's gonna be fine. Right?
          Debbie contemplates.
           ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Right?

                          DEBBIE
           Of course it will be fine. It's gonna
           be fine.

           KNOCKED UP - 34.

                         

                          ALISON
           Shit.

                          DEBBIE
           You just need to call him.

                          ALISON
           Maybe I don't need to call him until
           after I see the doctor.

                          DEBBIE
           You need to call.

                          ALISON
           I don't want to call him. I don't need
           to call him.

                          DEBBIE
           You should call.

                          ALISON
           I can't call him anyway. He doesn't
           even have a phone. He didn't even have
           a number to give me.

                          DEBBIE
           He doesn't have a phone?

                          ALISON
           Said some kind of billing issue.

                          DEBBIE
           He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a
           phone.

                          ALISON
           Shit, you're right. I got to call. I
           don't know. I'm gonna have to look him
           up on his stupid website.

                          DEBBIE
           What kind of website does he have?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, OFFICE

          Debbie and Alison sit at the computer looking at Flesh Of the
          Stars.

                          DEBBIE
           He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's
           "cum." That's gross.

                          ALISON
           Just go to "Contact Us."

                          DEBBIE
           Ben?

           You're sure?

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

          Ben and his roommates are sitting around smoking weed.

                          JONAH
           I could smoke weed every second of
           every day.

           I've been meaning to call you so we

           Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night?
           You wanna just grab some dinner?

                          BEN

           Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good.
           What do you say Geisha House,
           Hollywood, nine o'clock?

                          ALISON
           (into the phone)
           Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more
           like six, though? I'd like to keep it
           early.

                          BEN
           (into the phone)
           Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah,

          You look very pretty, though.

                          ALISON
          Thanks. Yeah, I just thought, I don't
          know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to
          hang out a little bit and... We didn't
          really get to talk much last time so I

                         THOUGHT--

                          BEN
          That we didn't.

                          ALISON
          I thought maybe we'd just talk and get
          to know each other...better.

                          BEN
          Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian.

          That's cool.

                          BEN
          From Vancouver. I live here illegally,
          actually. Don't tell anyone. But it
          works out in my advantage, ultimately,
          `cause I don't have to pay any taxes.
          So financially that's helpful `cause I
          don't have a lot of money. I'm not
          poor or anything but I eat a lot of
          spaghetti.

                          ALISON
          So the web page is it just something
          that you guys do for fun? Do you have
          a real job?

                          BEN
          Well, that is our job.

          Oh.

          We don't technically get money for the

          Oh, my God.

                          BEN
          It was my foot more than anything.
          But, I got fourteen grand from the
          British Columbia government.

                          ALISON
          Right.

                          BEN
          And that really lasted me until now.
          It's been almost ten years. I have
          like nine hundred bucks left. So that
          should last me for I'm not a
          mathematician, but like another two
          years or some shit...I think.

                          ALISON
          Yeah. So, I have something I really
          need to tell you. It's kind of why I
          called you. Here it goes. I'm
          pregnant.

                          BEN
          Fuck off.

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          What?

                          ALISON
          I'm pregnant...?

                          BEN
          With emotion?

                          ALISON
          With a baby. You're the father.

                          BEN
          I'm the father.

                          ALISON
          Yes!

                          BEN
          How the fuck could this happen?

                          ALISON
          I don't know. I thought you were
          wearing a condom.

                          BEN
          No.

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          I wasn't.

           KNOCKED UP - 40.

                         

                          ALISON
          Why not?

                          BEN
          Because you told me not to.

                          ALISON
          What are you talking about?

                          BEN
          What am I talking about? You told me
          not to.

                          ALISON
          I did not tell you not to wear a
          condom.

                          BEN
          Here's what happened, okay? I will
          give you a play-by-play of my memory.
          I almost had the condom on my dick. It
          was on the cusp and then you said,
          "Just do it, already."

                          ALISON
          I didn't mean do it without a condom.
          I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like
          "get fucking going!"

                          BEN
          Well, I assumed you were wearing a
          patch, or like a dental dam or one of
          those fuckin' butterfly clips or
          something like that.

                          ALISON
          What the hell is a dental dam?

                          BEN
          It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting,
          okay? But I thought you had one. Why
          the fuck didn't you stop me once we
          started?

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't
          tell that you didn't have one on!
          Obviously, I was drunk!

                          BEN
          Was your vagina drunk? Did you think
          it's the thinnest condom on earth I
          have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I
          made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed
          out a penis and put it on? What the
          fuck?!

                          ALISON
          You are unbelievable.

                          BEN
          Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've
          reacted unfavorably. So what happens
          now? I don't know how this works.

           I am going to the doctor next
           week...and I thought you could come
           with me to the gynecologist.

                          BEN
           So you haven't seen him, though?

                          ALISON
           No.

                          BEN
           So you don't know if you're pregnant.

                          ALISON
           Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

                          BEN
           You're not a hundred percent sure. I
           bet you're not pregnant.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           So, what can I help you with today,
           Mister and Mrs. Stone?

                          ALISON
           I took a home pregnancy test and it
           said I was pregnant, so here we are.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Let's have a look. Legs up.
          Alison puts her legs up and leans back.

                          BEN
           Nice office.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Thank you.
          Dr. Pellagrino examines Allison's genital area.
           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
           Well, you do look a lot like your
           sister.
          Dr. Pellagrino picks up a long cone shaped device.
           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
           This is gonna be cold.

                          (TO BEN)
           And you're next. I'm just kidding.
          Dr. Pellagrino looks at Ben and shrugs like saying "this is just
          part of the job" as he puts the cone device inside Alison.
           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           There's the cervix. And the uterus.
           See that? That dark sac there, that's
           the amniotic sac. And right there, in
           the middle is the embryo. Do you see
           that flicker? You know what that is?
           That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks
           like you are pregnant. About eight or
           nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations.
          Alison points to the monitor.

                          ALISON
           That, that's it?

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun
           part starts. Let me make a picture for
           ya, huh? That'll be fun.
          Alison begins to CRY.
           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll
           give ya a little time alone, there.

          Alison continues to cry. Ben stands by SILENTLY, stunned.

                          BEN

           wear a bag! Who does that?!

                          JASON
           Why did we go to Costco and buy a
           year's supply of condoms if you
           weren't gonna use `em, man?

                          JONAH
           I can't believe you did this. You
           fucked everything up.

                          JASON
           Look, the real point is not to get
           yourself in this position. That's what
           you have to realize. You gotta know
           all the tricks. Like, for example, if
           a woman's on top, she can't get
           pregnant. It's just gravity.

                          JONAH
           Everyone knows that.

           I think it's awesome that you're gonna
           have a kid, man. Think of it like
           this. It's just an excuse to play with
           all your old toys again.

                          JONAH
           You know what I think you should do?
           Take care of it.

           Tell me you don't want him to get an
           "A word."

                          JONAH
           Yes, I do, and I won't say it for
           little Baby Ears over there, but it
           rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just
           saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears
           -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion"
           are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.

                          JAY
           Ben, you cannot let these monsters
           have any part of your child's life.
           All right? I'm gonna be there to rear
           your child.

           the kid. He wants to rear your child!
          Ben gets up and leaves the room.

                          JONAH
           Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man.

           Oh, great. Now he's upset.

           are you gonna tell them?

                          ALISON
           Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a
           while. I have a while before I have to
           say anything.

                          BETTY
           How could you not tell them?

                          ALISON
           Well, they're not gonna know. I mean,
           I'm only gonna start to show when I'm
           like, I don't know, six months or
           something. Seven months.

           I cannot be supportive of this. This
           is a mistake. This is a big, big
           mistake. Now think about your
           stepsister. Now, you remember what
           happened with her? She had the same
           situation as you and she had it taken

           It is, you know?

                          HARRIS

           I had a vision for how my life would

                          BEN
           I guess it worked. You told me not to
           smoke pot all those years. And then I
           found out you were smoking pot that
           whole time.

                          HARRIS
           Not the whole time. Just in the
           evenings and all day every weekend.
           Not that much.

                          BEN
           Honestly, though, when you look at me,
           do you not think at all, like, you
           know, if he just never existed, I
           would have avoided a massive heap of
           trouble? You know?

                          HARRIS
           Absolutely not. I love you totally and
           completely. You're the best thing that
           ever happened to me.

                          BEN
           I'm the best thing that ever happened
           to you?

                          HARRIS
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           Now I just feel bad for you.

           Hey Alison, how's it goin'?

                          ALISON
           Good, good. You know, I was just
           calling to, let you know that, I've
           decided to keep the baby.That's what's
           happening with that.

                          BEN
           Good. That's good. That's what I was
           hoping you'd do. So, awesome.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, yeah, it is good.

                          BEN
           I know we didn't plan this and neither
           of us really thought it was gonna
           happen but life is like that, you
           know? You can't plan for it and even
           if we did, life doesn't care about
           your plans, necessarily, and you just
           kinda have to go with the flow and I
           just know my job is to just support
           you in whatever it is you wanna do.
           I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm
           gonna do.

                          ALISON
           I really appreciate you saying that.

                          BEN
           No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if
           you could help me by telling me, like
           one thing that I am supposed to do,
           then that would be good, `cause I
           literally have no idea whatsoever.

                          ALISON
           I have no idea either.

                          BEN
           Do you want to, like, get together and
           talk about it or something like that?

                          ALISON

           You must be angry at the baby whenever
           it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's
           mine, not yours." But, you know...
           Because you're family, you got to
           share.

                          ALISON

           trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock
           this shit.

           What the fuck, man?! If I go in there
           and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the
           toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my
           mind! Last time I went to the
           bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my
           shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed
           animal!

                          JAY

           Yeah.

           If this hadn't happened, I don't think
           I would have wanted to have a baby
           for, like, I don't know, at least ten
           years.

                          BEN
           At least! God, honestly, I just got
           used to the notion that someone would
           even have sex with me. I didn't think
           this would happen.

                          ALISON
           I like you, too.

                          BEN
           Sweet.

                          ALISON
           A little, so far. I mean, we have
           seven months before the baby comes. We
           don't have to rush it.

                          BEN
           Yeah.

                          ALISON
           We should really just try to get to
           know each other and...give this a real
           shot. You know? We got ourselves into
           this situation. We kind of have to.

                          BEN
           For the baby, right?

                          ALISON
           Exactly. Okay, if this was our second
           date, what would you do?

                          BEN
           B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told
           my roommates that I thought I was
           gonna get a B.J., so...

                          ALISON
           You know what? For the sake of getting
           to know one another, can you not talk
           like that?

                          BEN
           I can do that. I'm really nervous.

                          ALISON
           I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous.

                          BEN
           Yeah.
          Ben and Alison kiss.

                          ALISON
           You're a sweet guy, right?

                          BEN
           I think I am.

                          ALISON
           Don't fuck me over, okay?

                          BEN
           I wouldn't do that. Just so you know,
           I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that
           guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

                          BEN
           I couldn't take it. I can't raise this
           baby alone.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN

          Debbie, Pete, Charlotte, Sadie, Alison and Ben eat breakfast
          together.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Who's he?

                          BEN
           I'm Ben Stone.

                          ALISON
           He's my boyfriend.

                          PETE
           That's nice.

                          SADIE
           I never met him before.

                          ALISON
           He's a new boyfriend.

                          BEN
           But a boyfriend.

                          SADIE
           So he came over for breakfast because
           he's your new boyfriend?

                          DEBBIE
           He came from his house, drove over to
           our house because he thought it would
           be fun to have breakfast with us, so
           he drove his car from his house to our
           house to have breakfast.

                          PETE
           Because he likes breakfast so much.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I love breakfast.

                          BEN
           You guys wanna hear something neat?
           We're gonna have a baby together.

                          SADIE
           What?

                          BEN
           Yeah, a baby.

                          SADIE
           Well, you're not married. Aren't you
           supposed to be married to have a baby?

           KNOCKED UP - 56.

                         

                          PETE
           You don't have to be.

                          DEBBIE
           But they should be because they love
           each other and people who love each
           other get married and have babies.

                          SADIE
           Where do babies come from?

                          DEBBIE
           Where do you think they come from?

                          SADIE
           Well, I think a stork, he drops it
           down, and then, a hole goes in your
           body and there's blood everywhere,
           coming out of your head, and then you
           push your belly-button, and then your
           butt falls off and then you hold you
           butt and you have to dig and you find
           a little baby.

                          DEBBIE
           That's exactly right.

                         

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BACKYARD

          Ben is in a playhouse with Sadie while Charlotte jumps on the
          trampoline.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Feed the teddy bear.

                          BEN
           I feed your bear the grass? Know what
           your bear would also like to do with
           some grass? Smoke it.
          Allison and Debbie watch Ben and the kids from the patio.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           What do you think of him? He's funny,
           right?
          Ben throws the bear's bowl.

                          BEN
           Fetch. All right, bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           He's playing fetch with my kids. He's
           treating my kids like they're dogs.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           No's he not.
          Ben throws the bear this time.

           Go get it! Fetch!

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Plays fetch with the kids.

                          BEN
           All right!

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           He's trying. He's making an effort.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I don't wanna play this anymore.

                          BEN
           Bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           He's overweight. Where does that end?
           How old is he?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           Twenty-three.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Looks thirty-three. He can barely get
           in and out of that little house.
           Imagine how much bigger he's going to
           get.
          Ben tries to exit the playhouse but gets stuck a couple times.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           That means he has bad genes. Your kid
           is going to be overweight.

                          ALISON
           Shit.

                          BEN
           I'm gonna get you!
          Ben chases the girls on top of the trampoline.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna get you! Whoa!
          Ben falls off the trampoline onto the grass. The kids love it.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           Just give him a break.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Okay, I'll try.

          Ben and Pete sit while Charlotte and Sadie blow bubbles.

                          BEN
           They seem to love bubbles.

                          PETE
           They go ape-shit over bubbles.

                          BEN
           They're really going ape-shit.

                          PETE
           That's an incredible thing about a
           child. What's so great about bubbles?

                          BEN
           They float. You can pop them. I mean,
           I get it. I get it.

                          PETE
           I wish I liked anything as much as my
           kids like bubbles.

                          BEN
           That's sad.

                          PETE
           It's totally sad. Their smiling faces
           just point out your inability to enjoy
           anything.

                          BEN
           Am I going to be okay, man?

                          PETE
           Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not
           okay. You're asking the wrong guy.
           Just don't ask me to lend you any
           money, you know?

                          BEN
           Can I just have some?

                          PETE

                          BEN
          I can't ref the next games, by the
          way. I got to go meet gynecologists
          with Alison. She doesn't like her
          gynecologist.

                          JAY
          You think she likes you?

                          BEN
          She's trying to.

                          JAY
          She's entertaining the idea of liking
          you.

                          BEN
          Exactly. I'll take that.

                          JAY
          Wll, see she's bringing you to the
          gynechiatrist. She must like you.

                          BEN
          That's pretty good, I think.

                          JASON
          You know who I'd like to get pregnant
          is that Felicity Huffman, man. Ever
          since "Transamerica," I can't get her
          out of my mind.

                          BEN
          Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but
          it's kind of, uh, business meeting
          time. I need moolah. When do you think
          we can launch this site?

                          JAY
          Geez.

                          JONAH
          You can't rush this. You know what
          happens to these sites when they go up
          and they don't function well? They
          die.

                          BEN
          Seriously, guys, let's say I want to
          launch today. Let's start... let's use
          that as a jumping off point. Let's
          make this happen. What can we do?

                          JONAH
          Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I
          could work twelve hours a day.

           City College.

                          JONAH
           I went where I went, Jason.

                          BEN
           I'm not asking you to work twelve
           hours a day. I mean, you guys watch
           movies without nudity in them.

                          JASON
           I'll tell you what, man. We could
           probably get it online in three
           months.

                          BEN
           Thank you. Yes! Three months.

                          JONAH
           Come on, Jason!
          Jason serves the ball and Jonah hits it as hard as he can to win
          the game.

           Fuck off!

           How many doctors are there in your
           practice? Just because I'm sort of
           looking for a more personal
           experience. I want to make sure that
           you're my doctor on the day and...

           DR. HOWARD
           I understand. We have three other
           doctors in the practice but I'm your
           man, okay? I don't take vacations. I
           hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean
           when I was fourteen and I'm never
           going back.

                          ALISON
           I feel really good about this.

                          (TO BEN)
           I think we found our doctor.

                          BEN
           Really?

           Yeah.

                          BEN
           Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?

           DR. HOWARD
           You look relieved.

                          BEN
           I am very relieved.

           DR. HOWARD
           All right.

           Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you
           think they're gonna be mad? I'm really
           chickening out about this.

                          WARDROBE LADY
           It's okay. We can hide this. We'll

           Your boobs are going to be big. And
           then they're going to be like scary
           big. But then they'll go down. And
           then they'll stay down.

           Just don't say anything, okay? Please
           don't say anything.

           Those are sex offenders. These people
           live in our neighborhood.

           We'll skip their houses when we're
           trick or treating. What do you want me

           Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my

           You shouldn't take it so lightly.

                          PETE
           I don't take it lightly. I'm not going
           to go over to any of these people's
           houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can
           you baby sit?"

           don't get them vaccinated, don't let
           them eat fish. There's mercury in the

           What am I doing?

           Because I want to rip your fucking
           head off because you're so fucking

           don't know what I can say.

                          DEBBIE
           So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying
           to protect our kids from child
           molesters and mercury? And you're cool
           because you don't give a shit?

           Yeah.

           Pretty much.

           God, you're an asshole.

           Don't do this in front of Ben.

          Hi!

                          GIRL #2
          Oh, it's so good to see you.

                          ALISON
          You too. Oh, my God.

                          GIRL #2
          We've been watching you on E! It's the
          coolest thing.

                          ALISON
          Yeah, it's been super-exciting, just
          crazy busy. I'm so sorry I haven't
          called.

                          GIRL #2
          Oh, it's fine.

                          (TO BEN)
          Hi, I'm Ashley.

                          ALISON
          This is my friend, Ben.

                          BEN
          I'm Ben.

                          GIRL #2
          I went to school with Alison.

                          GIRL #1
          So, okay, so is Debbie having another
          baby?

                          BEN
          No. Alison is.

                          GIRL #2
          What?! I just saw you a couple months
          ago. You're pregnant?

                          ALISON
          It was a big surprise.

                          BEN
          It's a really funny story, actually,
          if you guys, if you got a second to
          hear it.

                          ALISON
          It's not really funny.

                          GIRL #1
          Tell us.

                          ALISON
          It's not funny.

                          BEN
          Let them be the judge, okay? I think
          it's funny.

           You know they say don't drink and
           drive?

                          GUY #1
           Right.

          Ben and Pete browse the records.

                          BEN
           Yeah, she was acting weird and I
           really think it's just because I
           haven't made an honest woman out of
           her. She's carrying my bastard child.
           No one wants that.

                          PETE
           That's what I did. I married Debbie
           when she got pregnant.

                          BEN
           You think she's, like, hiding me?
           Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me
           or something like that?

                          PETE
           Probably. I'd hide you.

                          BEN
           How much do wedding rings cost?

                          PETE
           It really depends, you know? I think
           you're supposed to spend three months
           pay on a ring.

                          BEN
           That'll be easy. I don't make any
           money.

                          PETE
           Really? I thought there was a lot of
           money in porn.

           God, it's not porn? All we do is we

                          PETE
           Like Mister Skin?

           This is exactly the same as our site.
           How the fuck did this happen?

                          JONAH
           Mister Skin! That's even a better name
           than ours!

                          MARTIN
           Well, fuck me in the beard.

                          JASON
           Dude, they got the top ten group

           Don't put this on me!

           God damn it!

                          MARTIN
           Well shit. I saw it online at one
           point, but I guess I didn't connect
           the dots.

                          JONAH
           What are we gonna do now?

                          BEN
           All we need to do is think of a new,
           better idea that no one else has
           thought of already.

           You know what? Just because this site
           exists doesn't mean ours won't work.

          INT. ALISON'S GUEST HOUSE

          Alison sits on the bed while Ben kneels in front of her.

                          BEN
           Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you
           pictured it being exactly and it's not
           how I wanted it. That is why I'm
           presenting you with this empty box.
           It's a promise, Alison. A promise that
           one day I will fill this with a ring
           that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I
           can't afford it yet. I've picked it
           out, though. It's at De Beers and it's
           really nice. So, basically, I'm asking
           you, will you marry me? Because I'm in
           love with you.

                          ALISON
           I love you too.

                          BEN
           Really? That's so nice to hear. That's
           the first time a girl's ever said that
           to me.

                          ALISON
           But here's the thing.

           KNOCKED UP - 73.

                         

                          BEN
           There's a thing?

                          ALISON
           I don't really know yet what that love
           means. It's so new and it's so
           exciting. It's great. I don't know.
           We've only known each other for
           seventeen weeks.

                          BEN
           Look, I thought you felt weird that
           we're having a baby and we're not
           engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.
           It hurts.
          Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.

                          ALISON
           I'm okay with that. We're just doing
           what we can. I don't want us to put
           any more pressure on ourselves than we
           have.

                          BEN
           That makes sense.

                          ALISON
           I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?

                          BEN
           No. I just wanted to do right by you.
           If you don't want to, that's totally
           cool.

                          ALISON
           I really do love you.

                          BEN
           I know. Thanks. You mentioned that.
           It's nice.

           Ben proposed to me. He did. It was
           really sweet. I feel a little bad. He
           was wearing this great button-down. He
           tucked it in. He got down on one knee.
           He didn't have an actual ring, though,
           just an empty box but he had this
           whole spiel about when he has the
           money, he'll buy me the ring I
           deserve.

                          DEBBIE
           The box was empty?

                          ALISON
           He can't afford a ring.

                          DEBBIE
           So he got down on one knee and gave
           you an empty box?

                          ALISON
           Yes.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry.

                          ALISON
           Get over it. If you'd been there, you
           would have cried.

                          DEBBIE
           You need to train him. Oprah said that
           when two people meet they should point
           out each other's differences and
           flaws.

                          ALISON
           I thought you should love people for
           who they are.

                          DEBBIE
           You criticize them a lot, so they get
           so down on themselves they have to
           change.

                          ALISON
           You don't think that's naggy?

                          DEBBIE
           In the end, they thank you for it.

                          DEBBIE
           You can't commit to him. You don't
           even know him. I don't even know Pete
           after ten years. I don't know what
           he's up to. He's miserable.

                          ALISON
           Why do you say that?

                          DEBBIE
           I think he's cheating on me. He's
           always going to business meetings at
           odd hours. Then I try to call him on
           his cell phone and he says he's in bad
           cell phone reception areas when he's
           in good reception areas.

                          ALISON
           Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's
           trying to sign a new band. I can't
           imagine Pete doing that.

                          DEBBIE
           There's no part of you that thinks
           maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

           You're not going to tell them?

                          ALISON
           No. I don't have to. It's illegal for
           them to fire me over it. And I get
           three months maternity leave if I
           stay. So I'm not going to tell them.

           Good plan.

           you want to live in India for a year.

                          DEBBIE
           No. You can go.

                          BEN
           I get what he means. Honestly, when I
           found out about...
          Ben motions towards Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           ...I had this flash of me in a white
           Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.
           The chopper's taping it, and I bust
           through the border and I'm free! I
           kept thinking that.
          Alison stares at Ben.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           It was a flash!

                          ALISON
           What do you mean?

                          BEN
           Don't look at me. We can talk about
           our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched
           up to you in the DeLorean and said,
           "Alison, I got the car here. What do
           you want to do?" No part of you would
           think, "Maybe I'll go back to that
           night and put a condom on Ben's dick?"
           You never got that flash?

                          ALISON
           No. What are you talking about?

                          PETE

           roads."

                          BEN
           You wouldn't do that?

                          ALISON
           I don't know who Doc Brown is. What
           are you talking about?

                          BEN
           Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He
           invented the DeLorean time machine.

                          PETE
           Everyone has a time machine image.

                          DEBBIE
           I have a really good idea. Why don't
           you two get in your time machine, go
           back in time and fuck each other?

                          PETE
           Who needs a time machine?
          Ben holds up his drink.

                          BEN
           This is my time machine!

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)
           I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun
           it to 88.

                          BEN

                          (TO PETE)
           You are a funny motherfucker, man.

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           How can you fight with him? I just
           want to kiss his face. He's cute.

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)
           I like the way you move.

                          BEN
           This is fun! We should do this more.
           This is the most fun I've had in a
           really long time.

          Ben and Alison are having sex. Ben is on top.

                          ALISON
           Come on, harder.

                          BEN
           I can't.

           KNOCKED UP - 78.

                         

                          ALISON
           Why? Just do it deeper.

                          BEN
           I can't.

                          ALISON
           Why?

                          BEN
           I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.

                          ALISON
           Just do it!

                          BEN
           Please don't yell at me.

                          ALISON
           The doctor and Debbie said it's fine.
           Come on!
          Ben stops.

                          BEN
           I'm sorry, can we change positions?
           I'm going to crush the baby.

                          ALISON
           That's ridiculous!

                          BEN
           No, it's not. It has no shell.

                          ALISON
           Millions of people have sex when
           they're pregnant! It just works!

                          BEN
           I weigh over 200 pounds.

                          ALISON
           Just get over it.

                          BEN
           I can't do it. Can you just get on
           top? All I can see if our baby, poked
           in the face by my penis.

                          ALISON
           Trust me, you're not even close. Okay,
           fine.
          Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           I can't do this. I can't focus like
           this. I look disgusting from this
           angle. I can feel you looking at my
           chins.

                          BEN
           You look beautiful. Your chin looks so
           skinny.

           And my boobs are all like, squishy and
           they're flopping around. I can feel it
           and it's distracting. It's all
           National Geographic.

                          (WHISPERING)
           Do you want to do it doggie style?

                          ALISON
           No. I do not want you to fuck me like
           a dog.

                          BEN
           I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's
           doggie style. It's just the style.
           I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't
           have to go outside or anything.
          Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Is it good?

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           Should I go slower?

                          ALISON
           Harder.

                          BEN
           Just tell me when you're close.

                          ALISON
           Just go harder.

                          BEN
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Keep going!
          Ben recoils.

                          BEN
           Oh, God. Oh, fuck!

                          ALISON
           What happened?

                          BEN
           The baby. It kicked my hand.

                          ALISON
           It always kicks.

                          BEN
           No, no, no, no, no.

           KNOCKED UP - 80.

           It's fine.

                          BEN
           Not like this. No, this was a warning
           kick.

                          ALISON
           Just keep going.

                          BEN
           This was a bad kick.

                          ALISON
           It's fine! It's fine!

                          BEN
           Look. My dick must be like an inch
           away from its face and it's coming,
           just coming in at its face. What if it
           kicked because it didn't like it? I
           can't do that to our baby. That's the
           first thing it's going to see.

                          ALISON
           What are you talking about?

                          BEN
           It's having the baby between us, it
           just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It
           just freaks me out a bit. It's a
           little weird.

                          ALISON
           I have totally lost it now.

                          BEN
           You've totally lost it?

                          ALISON
           I've lost it.

                          BEN
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Great, you know what? Just forget it.
          Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.

           (holding back tears)
           Don't worry. I won't make you do this
           again.

          Ben stands up and tries to steady himself.

           Fuck me.
          Jay runs through the room towards the front door.

                          JAY
           Oh my God! It's the Russians.
          Martin carries Jodi out.

                          MARTIN
           Jodi! I'll protect you!
          Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door. Alison runs to the
          door as well.

                          ALISON
           Ben!

                          BEN

          Jay, Martin, Alison, Jodi, Jonah, Jason and Ben stand on the

                          JAY
           That was horrible! That was so
           horrible.

                          JASON
           You're fine, man.

                          JAY
           When will it be light out?

                          JASON
           Take it easy.

                          JAY
           When will it be light out?

                          JASON
           Did anybody turn off the gas?

                          MARTIN
           I didn't do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 82.

                         

                          JASON

          Jason runs back to the house.

                          JONAH
           Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's
           a pretty incredible person.

                          MARTIN
           Nice to meet you.
          Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand
          from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately
          covers her breast with his hand.

                          JONAH
           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool,
           Martin.

                          MARTIN
           That's, that wasn't...

           Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?

                          JODI
           What happened?

                          MARTIN
           Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.

                          (TO BEN)
           Where were you?

                          BEN
           Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
           I'm sorry okay?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, because you were getting high
           off your huge bong. How am I supposed
           to be comfortable with the idea that
           you can take care of me and the baby
           if you are always getting high?

                          BEN
           You want me to stop smoking pot
           because there's an earthquake once
           every ten years? That makes no sense,
           Alison. You're being irrational. Just
           relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the
           cops.
          A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS
          on the payment.

          Ben and Alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed
          among other things.
          Alison finds Ben's bank statement that indicates he only has only

          $117.13.

                          BEN
           You know it's times like this I'm glad
           I don't own nice things. It's a big
           mess, but there's only like fifty
           bucks worth of shit here. That's kind
           of the good thing. You know, my dad
           told me, "Don't move to Northridge."
           But you figure, what are the chances
           of that happening twice, you know?
          Alison picks up a huge sword.

                          ALISON
           What is this?

                          BEN
           It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place
           doesn't get condemned. That would
           suck.
          Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None
          of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben
          noticing.

                          BEN
           Really?

                          ALISON
           Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails
           and there's an address. Ugh.

                          BEN
           Oh, man. I don't want to do that.

                          ALISON
           Ben, come on.

                          BEN
           He's not cheating on her.

                          ALISON
           How do you know?

                          BEN
           I just know.

                          ALISON
           Are you sure?

                          BEN
           I'm one hundred percent sure he's not
           cheating.

                          ALISON
           Are you really?

                          BEN
           No. It actually kind of makes sense
           that he would cheat.

                          ALISON
           Why?

                          BEN
           Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and
           Pete's awesome?

                          ALISON
           Well, why don't you just come over
           then, and, we'll just diffuse the
           situation a little?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner.

                          PETE
           I'm just saying the music industry is
           different now. Steely Dan would never
           even have a chance.

                          BEN
           Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan
           gargles my balls.

                          PETE
           They're incredible.

           KNOCKED UP - 85.

                         

                          BEN
           They really aren't good, man.

                          PETE
           Old Steely Dan.

                          BEN
           If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want
           you to slice my head off with an Al
           Jarreau LP.

                          PETE
           I should get going. I'm supposed to
           see this band tonight in Hollywood.
           Actually, they're playing in Laurel
           Canyon, so I'll call you because the
           reception's terrible over there.

                          BEN
           That's true.

                          PETE
           And I don't want you to worry. I'm
           just going to jump in the shower. It
           would be terrible if I smelled worse
           than the band.

                          DEBBIE
           Okay. Have fun.
          Ben exits.

                          BEN
           You guys are crazy. He's acting
           totally normal and hilarious.

                         

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with Alison and
          Ben.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
           She doesn't have a gun, does she?

                          ALISON
           No. I don't think so.

                          BEN
           Oh, great.

                         

          INT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Debbie tries the front door, it's unlocked. They enter.

                          BEN
           Looks like no one's home.

                          DEBBIE
           Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.

           KNOCKED UP - 86.

                         

                          BEN
           I just feel bad for Pete.

                          ALISON
           What?

                          BEN
           I feel like this isn't a good way to
           get caught cheating, it shouldn't be
           like this.

                          ALISON
           Well, maybe he should have thought of
           that before he was cheating.

                          BEN
           (through a fake cough)
           Pete!

                          ALISON
           Stop it.

                          BEN
           I coughed. What do you want from me?
          Debbie checks upstairs.

                          DEBBIE
           There's nobody up there.

                          BEN
           Thank you.

                          DEBBIE
           I guess I was wrong.

                          BEN
           I told you. Can we get out of here,
           please?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, come on. Let's go.
          A MURMUR comes from a far room.

                          DEBBIE
           Did you hear that?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          BEN
           I didn't hear anything.

                          ALISON
           Come on.
          Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS
          dressed in baseball clothing.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1

                          PETE
           Carlos Delgado.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           Excellent choice. Too bad I got him
           three rounds ago.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           You're still on the clock.

                          PETE
           Oh shit!

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           You gotta do something. We need a name
           here.

                          PETE
           Hideki Matsui.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.

                          PETE
           Sorry, Charlie.

                          DEBBIE
           What is this?

                          PETE
           Debbie.

                          DEBBIE
           What the fuck is this?

                          PETE
           It's our fantasy baseball draft.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           We said no wives.

                          DEBBIE
           Your fantasy what?

                          PETE
           It's, it's our draft...for fantasy
           baseball. I told you all about this.
           Got Matsui.
          Debbie turns and walks out of the room.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Aw, shit.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you
           in the vagina on the way out! Come on,
           who's going?

                         

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Pete and Debbie are in the driveway while Alison and Ben watch
          from the street.

           KNOCKED UP - 88.

                         

                          PETE
          I should have told you.

                          DEBBIE
          What else have you been lying about?

                          PETE
          Nothing.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
          That guy said, "Don't let the door hit
          you in the vagina on the way out."

                          DEBBIE
          Where were you on Wednesday?

                          PETE
          I'm going to be honest with you.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)
          Yeah, I heard him.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
          That was hilarious.

                          DEBBIE
          That would be a good idea.

                          PETE
          You've been mad because I've been
          working so much and I didn't want to
          upset you.

                          DEBBIE
          I wouldn't be mad.

                          PETE
          You would be.

                          DEBBIE
          I don't get mad.

                          PETE
          It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not
          cheating or anything.

                          DEBBIE
          No, this is worse.

                          PETE
          How is this worse?

                          DEBBIE
          This is you wanting to be with your
          friends more than your family.

                          PETE
          Look, the reason I make that up is
          because if I told you what I was
          really doing, you would just get mad.
          So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do
          my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.

           KNOCKED UP - 89.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Well, what did you do last Wednesday
           night when you said you went to see a
           band?

                          PETE
           I went to the movies.

                          DEBBIE
           With who?

                          PETE
           By myself.

                          DEBBIE
           What'd you see?

                          PETE
           "Spiderman Three."

                          DEBBIE
           Why do you want to go by yourself? Why
           didn't you ask me to go?

                          PETE
           Because I needed to get away, you
           know? With work and you and the kids,
           sometimes I just need some time to
           myself.

                          DEBBIE
           I need time for myself. I want time
           for myself, too.
          Debbie holds back tears.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           You're not the only one.

                          PETE
           It's not that big of a deal.

                          DEBBIE

                          (THROUGH TEARS)
           I like Spiderman.

                          PETE
           Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three"
           next week.

                          DEBBIE
           I don't want to go see it now.

                          PETE
           Well...

                          DEBBIE
           I don't want to have to ask you to ask
           me. I want you to just come up with it
           on your own.

                          PETE
           What? I don't even know what to say.
           Uh, what do you want me to do?

           KNOCKED UP - 90.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           You just think because you don't yell
           that you're not mean, but this is
           mean.

                          PETE
           I'm not being mean. I'm being honest.
           You're telling me I need to be honest.

                          JUST--

                          DEBBIE
           No, you're not. You're lying.

                          PETE
           I'm doing it because I need to keep my
           sanity a little bit.

                          DEBBIE
           You know what? I don't want you at the
           house anymore. Okay?

                          PETE
           Come on.
          Debbie heads for the car.

                          BEN

          I/E ALISON CAR - DAY
          Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben.

                          BEN
           How come we go to the gynecologist so
           often? I bet we have to go so much so
           we can pay for that three-hundred-
           thousand-dollar machine he has.

                          ALISON
           I cannot stop thinking about what an
           asshole Pete is.

                          BEN
           That's a little strong, I would say.

                          ALISON
           Really? Because that had to be one of
           the most selfish things I've ever
           witnessed.

                          BEN
           It's understandable. I even think it's
           kind of funny.

                          ALISON
           What's funny about it?

                          BEN
           Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't
           imagine, but you know, the situation.

          We break into this stranger's house

          sleeping with a woman, and then it's a
          bunch of nerds playing fantasy
          baseball.If you saw that on

          Yeah.

                          ALISON
          Is that what you want to do, Ben?

                          BEN
          I don't even like baseball. I'm just
          saying when you're a guy and you have
          a family and you have responsibility,
          you lose that male camaraderie, and I
          get that. I totally understand where
          he's coming from.

                          ALISON
          Why do you guys always go to that

          do I give a shit? Go hang out with
          your bearded freak friends. I don't

          that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's

                          BEN
          Well what the fuck am I supposed to
          say to that?

                          ALISON
          You should just support me! You know,
          you should just support everything I
          say because at this juncture in my
          life, I'm allowed to be wrong!

                          BEN
          So if you're wrong, I have to support
          it?

                          ALISON
          Yes!

                          BEN
          I can't tell you that you're acting
          like a lunatic?

                          ALISON
          Oh, that's helpful. You have to do
          nothing!

                          BEN
          I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!

          You are just fucking sitting there!
          You haven't sacrificed anything!

                          ALISON
           I've had to sacrifice my job, my body,
           my youth, my vagina!

                          BEN
           You've sacrificed your vagina?

                          ALISON
           Yes! It will never look the same after
           this!

           Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal
           reconstructive surgery.

                          ALISON
           You can't pay for shit! You can barely
           buy spaghetti.

                          BEN
           You're right. Fine!

           threaten me?!

                          ALISON
           You should just get out of the fucking

           I'm not going to get out of the car in
           the middle of nowhere! No!

                          ALISON
           Get out of the car.

                          BEN
           Can you let me back in the car,
           please? Have you calmed down? Did you
           take a breath? I have no clue where we
           are!
          Alison just glares at him.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Fine. Go. Great.

          Alison stands on a scale while DR. HOWARD'S NURSE weighs her.

                          ALISON
           You know what? Maybe I should take my
           shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt
           buckle's huge.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           Don't worry about gaining weight. Your
           baby wants you to gain a whole mess of
           weight.
          Ben walks into the room, winded.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)
           Are you fucking kidding me?

                          BEN
           Why don't you take off your earrings,
           too? They weigh about eighty pounds.
           They're made out of moon rocks aren't
           they?

                          ALISON
           Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am
           hormonal, I am terrified, and I am
           falling apart, so stop treating
           everything like it's a big joke!

                          BEN
           I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I
           just walked three fucking miles
           through Koreatown to get here. Sorry
           if I'm trying to lighten the mood a
           little.
          The Nurse leaves.

                          ALISON
           Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take
           anything seriously! You didn't even
           read the baby books.

                          BEN
           I didn't read the baby books! What's
           gonna happen? How did anyone ever give
           birth without a baby book?!

           That's right, the ancient Egyptians
           fucking engraved "What to Expect When
           You're Expecting" on the pyramid
           walls! I forgot about that! Who gives
           a flying fuck about the baby books?!

                          ALISON
           It just shows your lack of commitment,
           Ben! That you're not in this with me!

                          BEN
           Did you just say my lack of
           commitment? Because that's what it
           sounded like. It almost seems as
           though you forgot I proposed to you
           like an asshole! And you said no to
           me!

                          ALISON
           If you feel that way, you should just
           go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't
           mean to do this together, okay? And,
           and we tried to make it work and that
           was good, I suppose.
          Alison holds back tears.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           But it doesn't work. Because we are
           two completely different people. And I
           think it would just be easier for both
           of us if we stop fooling ourselves.

                          BEN
           You know what? I know this isn't you
           talking, it's your hormones, but I
           would just like to say, "Fuck you,
           hormones! You are a crazy bitch,
           hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck
           them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!

                          ALISON
           Nice. You are such an asshole. You
           know what? Go fuck your fucking bong,
           you fuck!

                          BEN
           I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for
           once.
          Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away. Dr.
          Howard's Nurse returns.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           Are you ready?

                          ALISON
           I'm really sorry about all that. That
           was really inappropriate.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           That's okay. It happens all the time
           here. It's fine.

           Not at all.

           I totally know what you're talking
           about, man. If I wrote out the list of
           shit Alison doesn't let me do it would
           be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't
           have samurai swords in your room.
           Don't have illegal grow operations in
           the house. I could go on all fucking
           day. Have I told her to stop doing
           anything ever? No.

                          PETE
           Marriage is like that show "Everybody
           Loves Raymond," but it's not funny.
           All the problems are the same, but
           it's... Instead of all the funny,
           pithy dialogue, everybody's just
           really pissed off and tense. Marriage
           is like an unfunny, tense version of
           "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it
           doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It
           lasts forever.

                          BEN
           Let's get out of here, man. Honestly,
           let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.

          Jason opens the door with Jonah and Jay. All of their eyes are

           We got pink eye.

                          JASON
           Very funny. That's not how you get
           pink eye. You get it from poo
           particles making their way into your

           Yo.

                          JAY
           How's it going? I farted on Jason's
           pillow as a practical joke. He farted
           on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And
           then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.
           I'm not proud of this. But, I think
           we've all forgiven each other. But, we
           can't go anywhere.

                          PETE
           You can get pink eye from farting in a
           pillow?

                          JONAH
           Totally.

                          PETE
           That's awesome.

                          BEN
           Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did
           someone take a dump right in your eye?

           No. No pink eye for me. I'm just

           Well stay back, guys. I got to get my

          Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub

           Yep. It's like I can't come here with
           Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's
           like she wants to hold me in, and she
           was telling Alison she could train
           you.

                          BEN

                          BEN
           You do?! No you don't.

                          PETE
           I swear to God, man.

                          BEN
           Holy shit!

                          PETE
           I see the beam of light.

           KNOCKED UP - 99.

                         

                          BEN
           There it is, baby.

                          PETE
           Woo-hoo. You're so money that you
           don't even know how much money you
           have.

                         

          INT. STRIP CLUB

          Ben and Pete receive lap dances from topless strippers.

                          BEN
           I love Vegas, man.

                          PETE
           This is the greatest place on earth.

                          BEN
           It's really amazing here.
          The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so
          that he face is pulled against her butt.

                          PETE
           Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.

                          BEN
           Now that's how you get pink eye.

                         

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison approach the nightclub, passing the line,
          straight to the DOORMAN. The Doorman lets TWO PRETTY GIRLS past
          the rope.

                          DOORMAN
           (to the Two Pretty Girls)
           Hey, what's up, baby girl?
          Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          DOORMAN
           What's up? End of the line, please.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

                          DOORMAN
           Yeah.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh, come on.

                          DOORMAN
           Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll
           let some people in when it clears out
           a little. You'll get right in if you
           go back to the end of the line.

           KNOCKED UP - 100.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           We come here all the time. It's not a
           big deal. It doesn't really look that
           crowded in there.

                          DOORMAN
           Hey, look, I don't make the rules.

                          DEBBIE
           Please?

                          DOORMAN
           No.
          TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.

                          DOORMAN (CONT'D)
           Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up
           pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get
           out. Take care of yourself.

                          DEBBIE
           What was that? What the fuck was that?

                          DOORMAN
           It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you
           step to the back, please?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           You know what? Maybe we should just
           go.

                          DEBBIE
           You don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN
           Yeah, but maybe you should listen to
           your friend.

                          DEBBIE
           No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN
           All right, you want to come in, you're
           going to have to go to the end of the
           line and wait like everybody else.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm not going to go to the end of the
           fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I
           have just as much of a right to be
           here as any of these little skanky
           girls! What, am I not skanky enough
           for you?! You want me to hike up my
           fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your
           problem?! I'm not going anywhere!
           You're just some `roided out freak
           with a fucking clipboard. And your
           stupid little fucking rope! You may
           have power now, but you're not God.
           You're a doorman! Okay? You're a
           doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking
           fag with your fucking little faggy
           gloves.

           KNOCKED UP - 101.

                         
          The Doorman grabs Debbie and takes her aside.

                          DOORMAN
           Come here, come on.
          The Doorman takes Debbie aside.

                          DOORMAN

                          (WHISPERING)
           I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I
           fucking hate this job. I don't want to
           be the one to pass judgement and
           decide who gets in. This shit makes me
           sick to my stomach. I get the runs
           from the stress. It's not because
           you're not hot. I would love to tap
           that ass. I would tear that ass up. I
           can't let you in because you're old as
           fuck...for this club, not, you know,
           for the earth.

                          DEBBIE
           What?

                          DOORMAN
           You old. She pregnant. Can't have a
           bunch of old, pregnant bitches running
           around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed
           to let in five percent black people.
           He said that. Five percent. That mean
           if there's twenty-five people here, I
           get to let in one-and-a-quarter black
           people. So I got to hope there's a
           black midget in the crowd.

                          DEBBIE
           Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

                          DOORMAN
           Why y'all want to be in here anyway?
           Y'all need to be at a yoga class or
           something.

                          (REGARDING ALISON)
           What the fuck is she doing at the
           club? That's not even good parenting
           right there. Your old ass should know
           better than that.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh, God. Ugh.
          Debbie takes Alison away.

                         

          EXT. VEGAS POOL - NIGHT

          Ben and Pete hold neon yard glasses and walk past numerous
          swimsuit-clad men and women.

                          BEN
           Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?
          Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably.

           KNOCKED UP - 102.

          INT. CIRQUE DU SOLEIL

          Ben and Pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles.

           BEN AND PETE
           Ohhhhhh!

                          BEN
           This was a great idea, man.

                          PETE
           This is the best idea I've ever had in
           my life.
          Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each
          other.

                          BEN
           What are they going to do? What in the
           world are they doing? If I shaved my
           stomach and my chest, I would look
           exactly like that. Those guys are at
           work right now.
           (imitating one of the

                          ACROBATS)
           What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted
           my brother.
          The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm
           freaking out right now, man!
          Many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           The mushrooms are turning on me!
          A clown dressed as a GIANT BABY is part of the act. Ben YELLS
          frantically.

                          GIANT BABY
           Papa.

                          BEN
           I am not your papa.
          A giant Snail comes out onto the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I can't deal with this shit, man!
          Ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit.

          EXT. STREET NEAR NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison sit on the curb.

                          DEBBIE

                          (WEEPING)
           It's over.

                          ALISON
           What's over?

                          DEBBIE
           My youth.

                          ALISON
           Don't say that.

                          DEBBIE
           It's true. I just want to dance. I
           love dancing.

                          ALISON
           So dance.

                          DEBBIE
           I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

                          ALISON
           I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking
           whale and I'm trying to get into some
           stupid club and--

                          DEBBIE
           You look beautiful. You're young and
           you're tall and you got the good lips
           and boobs. I'm going to be alone.

                          ALISON
           Debbie, no, you're not.

                          DEBBIE
           Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I
           get worse looking and he gets better
           looking, and it's so fucking unfair.
           Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter
           always gets mad when we come home past
           twelve. She's such a pissy little high-
           school cunt.

                         

          INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. A scene from
          "CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" plays on the television. Steve Martin
          juggles all of his children.

                          STEVE MARTIN

                          (ON TV)
           Let's move, gang! Come on, come on,
           come on! Jessica, can you get these
           plates and put them on the table,
           please?!

           KNOCKED UP - 104.

                         

                          BEN
           This isn't funny. That guy has twelve
           kids. It's not funny. This is sick.
           This is a sick movie. That's a lot of
           responsibility to be joking about.
           That's not funny. I got to turn this
           off. It's freaking me out.
          Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.

                          PETE
           There are five different types of
           chairs in this hotel room.

                          BEN
           Holy fuck. What are they all doing in
           here?

                          PETE
           These are five different types of
           chair.

                          BEN
           Get them out of here, man. This is too
           many chairs for one room.

                          PETE
           There's a guy that works for this
           hotel. His whole job is to find
           chairs.
          Pete moves to a tall chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Look at this one. Look at it. It's
           gold and red and it's kind of shiny.
           Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is
           beautiful, and it feels amazing.

                          BEN
           The tall one's gawking at me and the
           short one's being very droll. I don't
           like them.
          Pete switches to another chair.

                          PETE
           Oh, wow!

                          BEN
           It's weird that chairs even exist when
           you're not sitting on them.
          Pete switched to another tall chair.

                          PETE
           I'm up high! I'm really high up.

                          BEN
           I should've read the baby books.

                          PETE
           Why didn't you read the baby books?

           KNOCKED UP - 105.

                         

                          BEN
           Because then it's real, you know?

                          PETE
           Dude, it's real whether or not you
           read those books. That baby's coming.
          Pete sits on another chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Oh, man!

                          BEN
           Think they'll take us back?

                          PETE
           Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever
           wonder how somebody could even like
           you?

                          BEN
           All the time, man. Like every day. I
           wonder how you like me.

                          PETE
           How can Debbie like me? She likes me.
           I mean, she loves me. The biggest
           problem in our marriage is that she
           wants me around. She loves me so much
           that she wants me around all the time.
           That's our biggest problem. And I
           can't even accept that? Uh, like that
           upsets me?!
          Ben sits up from the bed.

                          BEN
           What?

                          PETE
           She's the one. She loves me.

                          BEN
           You can't believe...that people love
           you? I love you, man! Debbie loves
           you!

                          PETE
           I don't think I can accept her love.
           There's something wrong with me.

                          BEN
           You can't accept love?

                          PETE
           I don't know what it is.

                          BEN
           Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy
           thing in the world? You can't accept
           it?

                          PETE
           I have to go to this other chair.

           KNOCKED UP - 106.

                         
          Pete switches to a new chair.

           Oh, this is a better energy.

                          BEN
           You can't accept pure love? You can't
           accept Debbie? She's chosen to give
           you her life. She's picked you as her
           life partner! But you play fantasy
           baseball because you can't accept her
           love?
          Ben BURPS.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Ugh. I could accept it, man. And
           Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and
           she's funny and she smells good and
           she's nice and her hair always looks
           different. She's too good for you,
           man.
          Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.

                          BEN
           You're disgusting. You're an urchin.
           And she busts your balls because
           you're a little bitch! You're a filthy
           bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie
           wants to give her life to you and
           Alison doesn't want to do that with
           me. And it makes me sad all day. I
           want to go home.

                          PETE
           (with fist in mouth)
           I want to go home, too.

           Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?

           Around. You know, just kind of doing
           my thing.

           Why is everybody so mad at you?

                          BEN
           I don't know. Are they mad? What have
           they been saying?

                          SADIE
           They've been saying, like "blah-blah-
           blah-blah. Ben's a prick."

                          BEN
           They said that?

                          SADIE
           A lot.

                          BEN
           That sucks.

                          SADIE
           What does it mean?

                          BEN
           Penis. It means penis.

           Did you just get pink cupcakes or
           yellow and pink cupcakes?

                          PETE
           I just got yellow cupcakes.

                          DEBBIE
           I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.

                          PETE
           I can run out. I'll get some more.

                          DEBBIE
           Nah, it's no big deal.

                          PETE
           I don't mind.

                          DEBBIE
           No it doesn't matter.

           Well played, sir. That was good.

                          PETE
           You going to talk to Alison?

          Alison and Ben talk off to the side.

                          ALISON
           I just don't think we can make it
           work.

                          BEN
           We can get back on track and
           everything's going to be great.

                          ALISON
           You're just being nice. And I'm being
           nice and just because we're two nice
           people doesn't mean we should stay
           together. I don't want this baby to
           determine the rest of our lives. You
           know? Me not wanting to do this alone
           isn't enough of a reason to drag you
           into a relationship with me. It's just
           not fair. And, and don't repeat this,
           but, God, I don't want to end up like
           Debbie.

                          BEN
           But Debbie's happy.

                          ALISON
           She's happy today. But every day is a
           constant struggle for them because
           they're not right for each other. You
           know? And they have to force it and I
           don't want us to have to do that. I
           don't want to force you to be what I
           think you should be. That's wrong of
           me because you're great. You really
           are. You're great the way you are and,
           I mean, you like to get high and you
           like to do shrooms in Vegas.

           I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.

                          ALISON
           And who am I to stop you? Who am I to
           tell you that that's wrong? It's not
           wrong. It's who you are. It's what you
           enjoy and that's your life and...

                          BEN
           I'm not that guy anymore.

                          ALISON
           We can be friends. And you can be
           there when the baby is born, and in
           the baby's life as much as you want. I
           hope you will be.

                          BEN
           If you give me a shot to just show you
           that I'm con--

           Yeah.

                          (TO BEN)
           I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry.

                          BEN
           It's okay.

                          ALISON
           I'll be right back. We'll finish

           Thanks for warning me, man. I just
           walking into a fucking buzz saw! She
           rejected me! Because you, for some

           You know why she just rejected me?
           Because you're such a shitty husband,

           No, you don't look like a...fat cow at

           You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said
           everything was going to be fine and
           nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           Ben, I've been divorced three times.
           Why would you listen to me?

                          BEN
           Because you were the only one giving
           me advice! And it was, it was terrible
           advice!

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           You can go around blaming everyone
           else, but in the end, until you take
           responsibility for yourself, none of
           this is going to work out.

           I don't know how to take
           responsibility for myself, okay? I
           didn't read the baby books!

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           You didn't read the books?

                          BEN

           Alison, thank you for coming in. I
           don't want to shock you, but know
           what's under that jacket. You're
           pregnant, have been for a while. From
           my count, you're right around eight
           months. And I don't know why you felt
           you couldn't tell us.

                          ALISON
           I'm really sorry.

                          JILL
           This is Hollywood. We don't like
           liars.

                          ALISON
           I just wasn't expecting this and, I
           didn't know how to handle it, and I
           didn't want to lose my job. I'm really
           sorry.

                          JACK
           It's unfortunate that you didn't tell
           us because you would've found out that
           we thought it's great.

          Yeah.

                          JACK
          So, we did some research. And turns
          out, people like pregnant.

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God!

          The bigger you are, the bigger your
          numbers.

                          JILL
          I was surprised because I feel the
          opposite.

                          JACK
          We're going to do a whole maternity

          You're going to interview all the
          pregnant celebs.

          Really?

                          JACK
          Yes.

                          JILL
          Scary!

                          JACK
          If you're pregnant, they're pregnant,
          you can talk about being pregnant.

                          JILL
          It just grosses me out...when I know
          that people are pregnant. Because I
          think about the birth. Everything's so
          wet.

                          JACK
          And everything that goes into it. None
          of the gross stuff. But you know,
          hopes, dreams, whatever. It's going to
          be great.

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God. This is such good news.
          Thank you so much.

                          JACK
          You're welcome. And then, after the
          baby is out, tighten it back up.

                          JILL
          Tight. And please don't lie to us
          again. Because maybe someday we could
          be friends.

                          ALISON
           No. I don't want to go there. Don't go
           there, okay?

                          BEN
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Help me stay relaxed.

                          BEN
           So, what should I do?

                          ALISON
           You need to call Dr. Howard.
          Ben goes into the hall and calls Dr. Howard's house.

                         

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE

          Dr. Howard's housekeeper, MARIA, answers the phone.

                          MARIA
           Hello?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM


                          BEN
           Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling
           on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr.
           Howard. It's an emergency.

                         

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE


                          MARIA
           He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.

                         INTERCUT:

                          BEN
           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco? Do you know when he gets
           back?

                          MARIA
           In three days.

                          BEN
           Do you have his cell number, by any
           chance?
          Ben pops his head around the corner to talk to Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

                          (TO ALISON)
           Hey! Good news. I got his number right
           here. I'm going to call him right now.

                          ALISON
           Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad
           you're here. Thank you.

           KNOCKED UP - 122.

                         

                          BEN
           I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I
           shouldn't have told you you were a
           fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said
           that. I feel terrible about it.

                          ALISON
           No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm
           sorry I told you to fuck your bong.

                          BEN
           It's okay. I didn't

                          ALISON
           Let's just drop it now. We're over it.

                          BEN
           I'm going to call him right now.
           You're doing so great.
          Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard.

           DR. HOWARD (O.S.)
           Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here
           right now. Please leave a message.

                          BEN
           (into the phone)
           Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling.
           Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's
           going into labor and you are not
           fucking here. Now, where are you?
           You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco, you motherfucking piece of
           shit! And you know I'm going to have
           to do now? I'm going to have to kill
           you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in
           your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac!
           You are fucking Biggie, you piece of
           shit! I hope you fucking die or drop
           the fucking chair and kill that
           fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes.
           Peace, fucker!
          Ben goes back to Alison.

                          ALISON
           Hey.

                          BEN
           Hey.

                          ALISON
           Did you talk to him?

                          BEN
           I didn't talk to him directly, I left
           him a very nice message, though. What
           I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.
           You should know that going in. We can
           get through this and it's just a
           little hiccup, but everything will be
           fine. Do you trust me when I say
           everything will be fine?

           KNOCKED UP - 123.

                         

                          ALISON
          I can deal with it.

                          BEN
          Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar
          Mitzvah.

                          ALISON
          A Bar Mitzvah?

                          BEN
          It's a Jewish rite of passage. And
          he's going to be there for the next
          three days, so he will not be able to
          be here tonight.

                          ALISON
          It's okay. What do you think we should
          do?

                          BEN
          I know exactly what to do. All we do
          is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to
          the hospital, and on the way, we will
          call every gynecologist we've met.
          Someone will be available. You know?

                          ALISON
          I can do that.

                          BEN
          Good. We still have time. I mean, how
          far apart are your contractions?

                          ALISON
          I think, like, seven minutes.

                          BEN
          Seven minutes! See? Not until four
          minutes is it really coming. And has
          your water broken, even?

                          ALISON
          I don't know. I'm in the tub.

                          BEN
          That's a good point. Have you had,
          have you had your bloody show?

                          ALISON
          What's that?

                          BEN
          It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it
          only comes out right before the baby's
          going to come, so if that hasn't
          happened, we have time. We can make it
          to the hospital. It's no problem.

                          ALISON
          You read the baby books.

                          BEN
          Yeah. I did. I read three of them,
          actually.

           KNOCKED UP - 124.

                         

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

                          BEN
           You're welcome.

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Ben drives Alison's car. They park in a handicapped spot.

                          ALISON
           Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

                          BEN
           It's okay.
          Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs
          it on the mirror.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I stole this from Martin's grandma.

                          ALISON
           Oh. That was really sweet of you.

                          BEN
           Thanks.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - FRONT DESK

          Alison and Ben approach the desk. A male nurse, SAMUEL, and a
          FEMALE NURSE tend to them.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
           We're close. Home stretch.
           (to Female Nurse)
           Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni
           said he would let you know we were
           coming?

                          FEMALE NURSE
           He did. We'll take good care of you.
           Samuel?

                          SAMUEL
           Yeah?

                          FEMALE NURSE
           This is Alison Scott. Please admit her
           into room 307.

                          SAMUEL
           All right. Hi.

                          BEN
           You're our nurse?

                          SAMUEL
           That's why I'm holding the clipboard.
           So, uh, what else is up with you guys?

           KNOCKED UP - 125.

                         
          Ben and Alison stare at Samuel.

                          SAMUEL (CONT'D)
           I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV.

                          SAMUEL
           So, I'm sorry it took me so long to
           find that vein. That little guy really
           didn't want me to find him.

                          ALISON
           Is that the baby on that one right
           there?
          Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.

                          SAMUEL
           Yeah. That's how we can tell how the
           little guy or gal is doing.

                          ALISON
           Okay.
          A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.

           DR. KUNI
           Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.

                          BEN
           We really, really appreciate you
           coming, man.

           DR. KUNI
           What else do I have to do, I mean,
           besides sleep? I was only kidding.
           What happened to your doctor?

                          BEN
           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco. He didn't tell us though.

           DR. KUNI
           Nice.

                          BEN
           Yeah.

           DR. KUNI
           Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish
           friends.

                          ALISON
           Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this
           naturally. I don't want to use drugs.

           DR. KUNI
           Let's just take a look and see what
           happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is
           good. Samuel, where are we?

           KNOCKED UP - 126.

                         

                          SAMUEL
           Four centimeters.

           DR. KUNI
           Four centimeters what?

                          SAMUEL
           Dilated.

           DR. KUNI
           Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay
           attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

          Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room.

           I want to get the fuck out of here.

                          JAY
           What?

                          JONAH
           I just want to get the fuck out of
           here.

                          JAY
           Just relax, man, just relax.

                          JONAH
           I don't fucking like hospitals.

                          JAY
           Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think
           you need to relax and embrace the
           beauty of another life joining our
           gang. We're having a baby. We are
           having a baby.

                          JONAH
           I'm not having shit besides a fucking
           panic attack. There's probably a
           fucking room back there full of dead
           bodies! You guys want to be here when
           one rolls out and just fucking coughs
           malaria into our face?

                          JAY

           Is that good?

           KNOCKED UP - 127.

                         

                          ALISON
           Oh, yeah, get in there.

                          BEN
           I could do this all day.
          The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.

                          ALISON
           What was that?

                          BEN
           What the hell was that?
          Samuel hurries in to check the monitor.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What's that, what's happening?
          Dr. Kuni enters.

           DR. KUNI
           Well, boy and girls, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          SAMUEL
           Decels.

           DR. KUNI
           Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to
           turn on your back now, okay? The
           baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?

                          BEN
           It's going to be okay.
           (to Dr. Kuni)
           Is it going to be fine?
          Alison turns onto her back.

           DR. KUNI
           It's going to be fine. Okay?

                          (TO ALISON)
           You're going to feel a little bit of a
           push.
          Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby.

                          BEN
           What are you doing?

           DR. KUNI
           I'm turning the baby so I can take the
           pressure off the cord.

                          ALISON
           Oh, my God.
          The monitors stops beeping.

           KNOCKED UP - 128.

                         

           DR. KUNI
           We're good. The heartbeat's stronger,
           but we're not out of the woods. We
           need to get things going now. I think
           the cord is wrapped around the neck.
           Okay?

                          BEN
           What?

           DR. KUNI
           So I'm going to give you some
           medicine, pop the bag and get things
           going, okay? I don't want to leave the
           baby in there for long and we can give
           you some medicine for the pain.

                          ALISON
           No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby
           to be born all drugged out. It's not
           my birth plan.

           DR. KUNI
           Now, things change. We don't have time
           to debate this.

                          ALISON
           What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable
           with that. I'm not.

                          BEN
           No. Would you please just listen to
           her?

           DR. KUNI
           Fine. Do what you want to do.

                          BEN
           Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

           DR. KUNI
           Should I leave? Do you want to be the
           doctor? Because I really don't need to
           be here.

                          BEN
           No. What we want is to take a second
           to talk about our options, okay?
           That's all we want.

           DR. KUNI
           No. You mean you want to take a second
           to tell me how to do my job. My job is
           to get that baby out safely. Or I can
           go home! You just let me know. You be
           the doctor.

                          BEN
           Can we talk outside in the hall for a
           second?

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway.

           KNOCKED UP - 129.

                         

           DR. KUNI
           That woman is a control freak, and she
           needs to let go and let me do my job.

                          BEN
           Look, she's just having a hard time
           because her and her doctor had a very
           specific birth plan. And they wanted
           it to be a very special experience.

           DR. KUNI
           Okay. if you want a special
           experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet
           concert. We have a new birth plan: Get
           the baby out safely.

                          BEN
           Look, man, will you help us out? I
           have no idea what I'm doing. You can
           be as big a dick to me as you want.
           Just be nice to her, man. That's all I
           ask. Just please be nice to her.
          Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.

           DR. KUNI
           Are you okay?

                          BEN
           I think so.

           DR. KUNI
           I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

                          BEN
           Thank you, man.

           DR. KUNI
           This is healthy. This is good. I think
           we're bonding.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room.

           DR. KUNI
           Alison, I apologize for being a little
           brash, but if you're okay with it,
           it's rather important we break the bag
           and give you some medicine to speed
           things up. Because once the bag is
           broken, I don't want there to be an
           infection.

                          ALISON
           Whatever. Do what you have to do.
          Dr. Kuni exits.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           (whispering to Ben)
           Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy
           is.

           KNOCKED UP - 130.

                         

                          BEN
           I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.
           I think he'll be more cool now.

                          ALISON
           I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

                          BEN
           You really don't need to be. And you
           know, I knew you'd give me another
           shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner
           than this, you know?

                          ALISON
           I was just in such a panic from all of
           this. And watching Debbie and Pete
           together, and my ass got so fat.

                          BEN
           No, no.

                          ALISON
           It did. I just never, for one minute,
           thought that the guy who got me
           pregnant would actually be the right
           guy for me.

                          BEN
           Me neither.

                          ALISON
           I guess he is.

           Hi. I can't believe I go out of town
           and this happens.

                          ALISON
           I know.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

                          ALISON
           Screw Legoland.

                          PETE
           All right, how do you want this? You
           want this over the shoulder? I can do
           whatever you want. I can get in there.
           Kind of Spike Lee angles.

                          ALISON
           No, you can shoot the waiting room.
           That would be great.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO BEN)
           Well, thank you. I've got it from
           here.

                          ALISON
           Debbie.

           Can I talk to you in the hall for a
           second?

                          DEBBIE
           Why?

          Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone.

                          BEN
           I'd like to be in there with
           Alison...without you.

                          DEBBIE
           Okay. I understand how you feel, but
           this isn't up to you.

           KNOCKED UP - 132.

                         

                          BEN
           Look, Debbie, you are high off your
           ass if you think you're coming into
           that room. If you take one step
           towards that door, I will tell
           security there's a crazy chick in a
           pink dress snatching up babies. Okay?
           So don't even try to come into that
           room. That's my room now. That little
           area with the Pepsi machine...that's
           your area. My room. Your area. Stay in
           your area. Stay out of my room. Back
           the fuck off.

           What are you doing here?

                          DEBBIE
           He just kicked me out. He told me to
           leave. But I guess it's good, right?
           He said he's going to take care of
           her. He really seems on his game. I
           think he's going to be a good dad. I
           think I like him. Thank God.

           Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit,
           this really hurts!

           DR. KUNI
           Ah, I see we're well on our way.

                          ALISON
           I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the
           epidural!

                          BEN
           Give it to her. Give her the epidural,
           okay?

                          ALISON
           Okay?

                          BEN
           Give it to her now.

           DR. KUNI
           Alison, we're past the point of an
           epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.

           KNOCKED UP - 133.

                         

                          ALISON
           No, seriously, I want an epidural! I
           know there's time!

           DR. KUNI
           We can't give you the epidural.

                          ALISON
           Take the time! I'll make sure it
           doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.

                          BEN
           We have time.

                          ALISON
           I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!

                          BEN
           Just do it, please!

           DR. KUNI
           I'm sorry. We have no time. We're
           going to just have to do this the all
           natural way, okay? The way you wanted
           to do it. Okay? Ready?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

           DR. KUNI
           Here comes another contraction, okay?
           I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good,
           good, good.

                          ALISON
           I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's
           happening.

                          SAMUEL
           Maybe we can take it down just a
           little. I think you're going to scare
           the other pregnant women.

                          ALISON
           Are you fucking kidding me? Are you

           No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's
           only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to
           me like she's crowning. Is that right,
           Deb?

           KNOCKED UP - 134.

           Yeah. That's what it sounds like for
           everyone. Everyone goes through this.

                          JAY
           No, I disagree with you. That sounds
           terrible. I'm going to go sneak a
           peek, see if there's anything I can
           do.

           It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!

                          ALISON
           Oh, God. Honey, what does it look
           like, Ben?
          Been peers down between Alison's legs.
          We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being
          pushed out of Alison's vagina.

                          BEN
           Oh, God.

           What?

                          BEN
           You don't want to see it. You don't

                          WANT--

                          ALISON
           No, I want to see it!

                          BEN
           It's beautiful. You don't want to,
           though.

                          ALISON
           No, I want to see...
          A nurse holds a mirror for Alison. She sees the actual crowning
          shot.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           ...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!

                          JAY
           One sec.

                          JONAH
           What did it look like?

                          JAY
           I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't
           go in there. Promise me you don't go
           in there.

                          JONAH
           Me go in there? That's the last
           fucking place I want to go. Like I'm
           going to go in there. Try getting a

          Jason beams at Debbie.

          The birth is still in progress.

           Push. One, two, three.

           Oh, God!

           DR. KUNI
           You've passed the shoulders. One more

          The baby comes out. Dr. Kuni cleans it up.

           You did it.

                          ALISON
           It's out.

                          BEN
           You did it. Oh, my God, you did it.
          Dr. Kuni hands the baby to Alison.

                          ALISON
           Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.

                          BEN
           I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.

           DR. KUNI
           Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

           DR. KUNI
           You did so great. You were amazing.

                          ALISON
           Pretty baby.

                          BEN
           You got out. You made it out. Welcome.

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

          Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby. Everyone else has gone
          home.

                          BEN
           (to the baby)
           And then your mommy said, "Just do it,
           already," which was very confusing to
           Daddy. So I listened to the most
           literal translation of that and I just
           did it, already. What would you do?
           Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
           smartest thing I ever did, listening
           to her, because now you're here. Isn't
           that nice? I think it is.

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Ben and a Nurse push Alison and the baby in a wheelchair.

                         

          I/E ALISON'S CAR
          Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.

                          ALISON
           I hope your apartment's big enough for
           the three of us.

                          BEN
           It definitely is. That's why I got one
           in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The
           only thing is we have to decide if
           we're going to be Crips or Bloods
           before we get there.

                          ALISON
           Well, I look good in red.

           KNOCKED UP - 139.

                         

                          BEN
           I look good in blue. The fighting
           continues. We could just throw off
           everyone and become Latin Kings.

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           We both look good in gold.

                          ALISON
           Good choice. I would yell at you about
           driving so slow, except the baby's
           here.

                          BEN
           No, these guys can honk all they want.
           I ain't going faster than twelve. It
           might take us around three hours to
           get home, though.
          The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting
          behind them.

FADE IN:

EXT.  ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

A three lane highway relegated to one lane.  The serpentine
line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of
ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass
and twisted metal.

We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance
and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved
in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front
caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the
car.

The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN
HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that
separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.
All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot
length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded
back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through
the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,
purple, swollen and bloody.

Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have
walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back.

                    POLICE OFFICER
          Get back in your cars and continue
          with the traffic.  There is nothing
          you can do.
              (beat)
          Get back in your cars...

                                                  CUT TO:

OFFICER PIERCE speaks to a female OFFICER DANA.

                    OFFICER PIERCE
          What's the story?

                    OFFICER DANA
          She's been dead about ten minutes.
          The jaws are on the way... Ran a
          license check.  Her name is Ellen
          Parker.  Forty-two years old.

                    OFFICER PIERCE
          What about him?

Pierce gestures to a HISPANIC TEENAGER who is cuffed behind
his back and being led to a police car.

                    OFFICER DANA
          D.U.I.

                    OFFICER PIERCE
          Shit... How old is he?

                    OFFICER DANA
          Seventeen.  It's his grandfather's
          car.  On his way back from drinking
          with the 'boys'.

Pierce lets it sink in.

                    OFFICER PIERCE
          Who do we contact for her?

Dana checks the papers in her hand.

                    OFFICER DANA
          Her husband.  Maurice Parker.  They
          live in Wynnewood.  Married
          seventeen years.

Pierce looks back at what remains of the HONDA PRELUDE.
Beat.

                    OFFICER PIERCE
          There isn't any good left in the
          world, Dana.  Not one damn thing.

CLOSE UP of the hypnotic RED AND BLUE LIGHTS that consume the
highway.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  ROAD - EARLY MORNING

                    "TWO WEEKS EARLIER"

Just AFTER DAWN.  A gentle mist hangs in the air.  The calm
suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle
class homeowners on their way to work...

A woman's REEBOK CROSS-TRAINERS move along the sidewalk...
long, brisk steps, steps people have when walking with a
purpose...

The Cross-Trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds
after a man turns a window-sign from "CLOSED" to "OPEN"...
This happens with precision timing, not losing a step... a
well practiced routine.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  ANGELO'S BAKERY - MORNING

ANGELO, a large man, black slicked hair -- has laid out three
identical loaves of RAISIN BREAD on the counter.

                    ANGELO
          Very good batch today.

We finally see the person standing in the REEBOK CROSS
TRAINERS... MRS. ELLEN PARKER, a woman in her forties with a
heart-warming smile and wise glint in her eyes.  The kind of
woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age.

She carefully squeezes each loaf.  Her hand hovers over the
middle loaf.

                    ELLEN
          That one.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Twenty minutes later.  The basket of the "chosen" raisin
bread is placed on the center of a table.  Ellen covers it
with a cloth napkin.

The eggs sizzle in a pan.  We find Ellen cooking breakfast.
A stunning African Grey Parrot sits proudly on Ellen's
shoulder.  CLAUDE is a breathtaking creature with grey
feathers and a cherry red tail.

The DOOR BELL RINGS.

                                                  CUT TO:

FRONT DOOR

where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of VIOLET ORCHIDS.
Claude, still perched on Ellen like a clothing accessory,
spreads his impressive wings defensively.  The delivery man
scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs.
A dazzling collection of all kinds of birds, elaborately
framed and hung.

Ellen signs the release and closes the door.  She takes a
deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to
the open bedroom door with a glowing smile.  We CATCH A
GLIMPSE of a man dressing.

                                                  CUT TO:

KITCHEN

Where Ellen and her husband are eating breakfast.  Claude is
now in a cage in the hallway.

MR. MAURICE PARKER eats a buttered piece of raisin bread.  He
is a man in his late forties, neatly combed hair, his New
York Times folded into a manageable rectangle.  This is a man
who has been seated a great deal of his life... the type of
man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage.

He feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that
glowing smile.  He smiles back.

Ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now
displayed proudly on the window ledge.

                    MAURICE
          Yes?

                    ELLEN
          The flowers... they're beautiful.

Maurice studies them.

                    MAURICE
          They are... who sent them?

Beat.  This takes Ellen by surprise.  Maurice catches the
expression.

                    MAURICE
          You thought I sent them?

                    ELLEN
              (disappointed)
          There was no card.

Maurice reaches over and searches the bouquet.

                    MAURICE
          Have I forgotten something?  Is
          this a special day?

                    ELLEN
              (flat)
          It's just a regular day.

Maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems.

                    MAURICE
          It's from Dan and Kate Wilkins...
          for dinner last week...

Maurice hands Ellen the card, she looks at it uninterested.

                    MAURICE
          It's a special day isn't it?

                    ELLEN
          Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas,
          because you'd be worried about how
          much money we don't have to spend
          on each other... I know it's not
          New Years, because you'd be going
          on and on about wearing a tuxedo
          and how much you don't like to
          dance... and I'm sure it's not our
          anniversary, because I didn't find
          an envelope with a hundred dollars
          cash on my bureau with a note that
          says, 'Pick out something
          pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm
          virtually certain it's not a
          special day today.

Ellen begins to eat.  Maurice stares at her...

                    MAURICE
          You're mad at me... You were
          beaming a minute ago, but since I
          didn't send the flowers... now
          you're mad at me.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          Why would I send flowers?  What's
          the occasion.

Ellen instantly becomes emotional.

                    ELLEN
          Occasion?  Because you love me...
          That's the occasion.

Ellen returns to eating.  Maurice stares at her quietly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BOOKSTORE - MORNING

A SHAFT OF LIGHT penetrates the darkness of a room... growing
LARGER as the door swings open.

Ellen steps in first followed by Maurice.  Ellen goes
straight for the blinds.  BURST OF LIGHT stab the room.

The spines of the BOOKS catch the light... rows and rows of
books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves.  This is an
old-fashioned store with antique chairs at select places.  A
coffee table sits near the window with a set of deep
cushioned sofa-chairs.  This store is a home...

Maurice moves behind the counter and TURNS ON THE RADIO.
CHOPIN FLOWS from the old speakers atop the corner shelves --
delicately.

Ellen opens the door to the store and locks it in that
position with a slanted piece of wood... The store is now
open.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BOOKSTORE - DAY

Half a dozen people wander the isles.  Maurice's eyes drift
to a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the
store.  One boy disappears behind "Philosophy" and reappears
momentarily with his sweat-shirt zipped up to his neck -- a
rectangle is outlined under his shirt.

                    MAURICE
          I see that!

Maurice comes around the corner -- the boys HAUL ASS out of
the store.  They're long gone before Maurice reaches the
door.  He yells after them.

                    MAURICE
          I'm getting a Doberman!  Two!

Ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts,
comes out when she hears the commotion.

                    ELLEN
          You've been saying that for two
          years; I think they know you're
          bluffing.

Maurice inspects the "Philosophy" section.

Maurice looks up as a young man, early twenties, hurries in.
KRIS REDDY walks past Maurice, his black locks of hair
peeking out from under his Philadelphia Eagles cap.

                    KRIS
              (to Maurice)
          Lizy Bennett?

                    ELLEN
          Hi Kris.

Kris waves as he removes his jacket.  He is wearing a PARKER
BOOKS T-shirt underneath.  He pins an "Assistant Manager" tag
on.

Maurice thinks to himself.

                    MAURICE
          Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...
              (the answer comes to him)
          Pride and Prejudice.

                    KRIS
          You're amazing.

                    MAURICE
          It has to be a full character's
          name.

                    KRIS
          They called her 'Lizy' in the
          book...
              (beat)
          Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on
          the way over from the paper.

                    MAURICE
          They printed your article on, 'Dry
          Verses Can Dog Food'... Very
          enlightening.

                    KRIS
          Pulitzer, here I come.

Kris notices as Maurice goes back to searching the isles.

                    KRIS
          What happened?

                    MAURICE
          Never have children.  If they're
          not a burden to you, they're a
          burden to someone else.

                    ELLEN
              (on the end of his words)
          Kris, go to the pharmacy.  Ask Mr.
          Donnavan to get you a large bottle
          of Geritol... Tell him, Maurice has
          officially become a grumpy old man.

                    KRIS
          What'd they take this time?

                    MAURICE
          Nietzsche!... As if they're going
          to read Nietzsche.

Maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated.

                    ELLEN
          They pick on you because they can
          get a rise out of you... children
          can sense those things.

Kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a
mini-tape recorder.  He talks into it -- dead serious.

                    KRIS
          Monday -- August 24... Juvenile
          delinquency -- Are the victims to
          blame?

CLICK.  The tape recorder returns to the bag.  Ellen stares
at him curiously.

                    KRIS
          Story ideas.  I'll forget them
          otherwise.

Ellen nods with realization.  Ellen and Kris turn their
attention to Maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily.  He
looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of
school boys waving at him tauntingly.

INT.  CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

DIMLY LIT.  Red and gold paper mache lanterns are sprinkled
around the room.  WE FIND Ellen and Maurice polishing off a
dish of General Tso's Chicken.

                    MAURICE
          Two thousand square feet... We can
          add a used book section.

Ellen is not listening.  She is staring at a young couple two
tables over, who can't take their eyes off each other.

                    MAURICE
          Next door is a jewelry store with a
          full-time security guard... He
          stands outside all day.  Let's see
          them try and take Nietzsche then...

Maurice finally notices Ellen is not listening.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen?

                    ELLEN
              (snapping out of it)
          What?

                    MAURICE
          The new store?

                    ELLEN
          Honey, I told you.  If it makes you
          happy, we should just do it.

                    MAURICE
          It's a tremendous amount of work --
          moving.

                    ELLEN
          We can do it together.

Maurice needed the support.  His face brightens.

LATER

An empty table.  The dishes have been cleared.  Maurice and
Ellen are opening their fortune cookies.

                    MAURICE
          What's your's say?

Beat.

                    ELLEN
          ... Love is shown through actions
          not just words.

                    MAURICE
          What's that?  That's not a
          fortune... You will be rich...
          That's a fortune.  What you have is
          a statement.

                    ELLEN
          What it is -- is the truth.

                    MAURICE
          I don't follow.

Beat.

                    ELLEN
          Maurice, what would you do for me?
          What would you do for our love?
          I'm not talking about saying, I'm
          talking about doing.

Maurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE.

                    MAURICE
          Is this going to be similar to the
          flower incident?

                    ELLEN
              (very emotional)
          Sometimes people need to see things
          done for them -- because sooner or
          later they don't believe the words
          anymore.

                    MAURICE
              (raising his voice)
          You don't think I love you?

Customers react.

                    ELLEN
              (lowering the volume)
          I want to be shown...
              (beat)
          Maurice would you do anything for
          me?

                    MAURICE
          Yes.

                    ELLEN
          Anything?

                    MAURICE
          What do you want from me?  Would I
          swim across an ocean for you?...
          Would I walk across the United
          States for you?  Yes... Yes I
          would.  You know that.

                    ELLEN
              (soft)
          No I don't.  I don't even know if
          you'd walk across the street for
          me.

Maurice is getting redder by the second.  The entire
restaurant hangs on his response...

                    MAURICE
          So what have you done for me that's
          so earth-shattering?

The waiter closest to the table cringes with Maurice's words.
Ellen drains of color.  She stares at him in complete and
utter disbelief.  She drills him with this iron glare for an
eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit.  Maurice
stares at the table for a moment to gather what's left of his
dignity and follows her out.

The waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath.  He
sees Ellen's fortune crumpled next to her tea cup.  He
unravels it.  The fortune reads...

          "YOU ARE A FRIENDLY AND GENEROUS PERSON."

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

The room is LIT BY ONE BEDSIDE LAMP.  Maurice is sitting in
bed wearing a robe.  Reading glasses at the end of his nose
as he rubs a yellow cloth over a SILVER MEDALLION.  The
medallion has a raised picture of a lamp, the kind Aladdin
uses, seated on an open book and the words BOOK SOCIETY -
1992.  Maurice meticulously rubs away the smudge marks.

Ellen is at the edge of the bed -- as far from Maurice as
possible.  Her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers.
She speaks without turning around.

                    ELLEN
          Why do you polish that thing all
          the time?

                    MAURICE
          You're talking to me?

                    ELLEN
          Why do you polish it?

Maurice studies the impressive silver medallion.

                    MAURICE
          A Book Society Award is a very
          prestigious thing.

                    ELLEN
          Why are you polishing it -- in bed
          -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at
          night?  Are you going to show it to
          someone?

                    MAURICE
          No.

                    ELLEN
          Then why?

                    MAURICE
          There's no reason.

                    ELLEN
          Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion.
          It just makes you feel good to do
          something for it, to express your
          pride and affection for it some
          how...
              (beat)
          How come you'd do that for a piece
          of metal and not for me?

Maurice has no answer.  He just stares at his hands.

ELLEN'S face can be seen under the covers facing away from
Maurice.  Her eyes are red.  The tears roll off her nose and
land on the pillow unseen and unheard.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

The kitchen table is mockingly empty.  No bread.  Not even a
crumb.  Maurice, dressed for work, eyes the table with great
resolve.  He rubs his hands together ceremoniously.

                    MAURICE
          I can do this.

Maurice moves to the fridge and gets out two eggs, onions,
green peppers and mushrooms.

CLAUDE is chirping INCESSANTLY FROM THE HALL.

The pile teeters precariously in Maurice's arms as he moves
to the counter.  Next the pans come out -- He tries to pull
the bottom pan from the cabinet --

                                                  CUT TO:

BEDROOM

Ellen is seated in bed, arms crossed -- equal resolve in her
face.  A LARGE METALLIC CRASH OF POTS ECHOES FROM DOWNSTAIRS.
Ellen grabs her robe.

                                                  CUT TO:

HALLWAY

Ellen gently takes Claude out of his cage.  She kisses him.
The bird, once frantic, instantly at peace.

                    ELLEN
              (whispering)
          You missed mommie... worried when I
          didn't come down... my baby... so
          sweet.

Ellen feeds the bird as she peeks around the corner, careful
not to be seen.  Maurice is desperately trying to cook an out
of control omelette.  It spills over the sides and SIZZLES on
the range top.  He tries to scoop it up with the pan, tilting
it further -- further -- the entire omelette slides onto the
range.  Maurice frantically tries to wrangle it back in.  Man
vs. Egg.  Man losing.

Ellen has to keep herself from laughing.  Her expression
changes to pity as she watches the chaos unfold.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

A defeated Maurice is eating an apple.  He looks up with
surprise as Ellen walks into the kitchen from the back door,
a bag under her arm.  She glances at him and then moves to
the counter where she prepares the bread for serving.  Ellen
looks down into the trash to find the rebellious omelette
sitting uneaten.

The bread gets laid out in its usual basket, in its usual
manner.  Maurice says nothing as Ellen pulls two eggs from
the fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert
ease.

                    ELLEN
          Onions?

Maurice smiles warmly at his wife's back before moving to her
and hugging her from behind.  He whispers in her ear.

                    MAURICE
          Why do you put up with me?

Beat.

                    ELLEN
          Love... has something to do with
          it.

Maurice reaches over and turns off the stove.  He then turn
Ellen around and kisses her long and hard.  Ellen pulls away
gently and stares into his eyes.  Maurice looks very
emotional.

                    MAURICE
          I do love you... very, very much.

                    ELLEN
          Show me.

                    MAURICE
              (with all his heart)
          I will -- I promise.

Ellen kisses Maurice and returns to the eggs.  Maurice
continues to hug her from behind.  The MORNING SUN pours into
the kitchen covering Ellen and Maurice in a golden bath.

INT.  EMPTY STORE - AFTERNOON

A large black man wearing a dress shirt, sleeves rolled up to
the elbows TURNS ON a switch.  A SET OF TUBE LIGHTS FLICKER
TO LIFE.

CARL STONE leads Maurice out to the main room which is
presently a cob-web infested, barren space with a few
discarded packing boxes left in the corners.

Maurice runs his fingertips against the wall.

                    MAURICE
          History and the arts will be
          here...

His hand makes a grand swirl pointing to another area.  He
says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying
something holy.

                    MAURICE
          The Classics...

Carl watches curiously as Maurice walks around in a trance.
He moves to the bay window that over looks the street.

                    MAURICE
          We'll have a hand-painted sign...
              (another grand swirl)
          ... Parker Books.

Maurice's already bright eyes, brighten even more as he spots
the security guard strolling up and down the front of the
jewelry store.  The guard catches his stare and waves.
Maurice is aglow... He turns to Carl.

                    MAURICE
          This is my dream... it's finally
          here.

Carl has to smile -- rarely does he see someone so happy.

INT.  OFFICE ROOM - AFTERNOON

We are in Carl's cramped upstairs office... just enough room
to walk amongst the file cabinets.

Maurice holds his pen over the documents before him.

                    MAURICE
          I wish my wife were here.  She
          should see this...
              (stalling)
          She had a doctors appointment in
          Blue Bell.  That's a one and a half
          hour drive.  Ellen's been going to
          that doctor since she moved to
          Pennsylvania...

                    CARL
              (understanding)
          We could do this tomorrow?

                    MAURICE
          Ellen gave me strict orders to sign
          it... We invited some friends over
          -- you see, for a celebration.

Carl smiles patiently, he's seen this before.

Maurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper... He
scribbles his signature quickly and let's the pen drop to the
table top as if all the energy drained from his body.  He
looks up to Carl with powerful eyes.

                    MAURICE
          Every journey begins with one step
          right?

Beat.

                    CARL
          Enjoy your party Mr. Parker... Your
          new store will be waiting for you
          Monday morning.

Carl and Maurice shake hands like best friends.

INT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

A wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table.  The SOUNDS
OF LIGHT CONVERSATION float through the room.  About ten
friends and family have gathered.

Maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window.  He's listening
to the drone of TED PRICE.

Ellen is not present.

                    TED
          ... So she says the "L" word, after
          two dates, the "L" word!  She says
          'Don't you believe in true love?
          Love that can conquer all?'  I say,
          'Whoa, hold on.  Just so we're
          clear on things, I think love these
          days is shit.  It don't mean a
          thing and it don't stand for
          nothing.  Shit.'... You know what
          she says, 'Fine, but how do you
          feel about kids?'

Everyone near the SOFA LAUGHS.  A CAR LIGHT DANCES ON THE
CURTAINS... Maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and
watches as the car pulls past the house and around the
corner.  Maurice turns back from the window hiding his
concern and without missing a beat...

                    MAURICE
          It's nice to see you don't have any
          scars from your divorce.

This brings on another ROUND OF LAUGHTER.

THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

Maurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE
MATLIN who picks up the phone right away.  Adelle is
Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always
smiling -- except at this moment.

Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are
incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle
turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS
into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the
doorway... Something is definitely wrong.

Maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen...
eternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again.  She looks
different -- ghostly.  She glances up for a fraction of a
second locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks
away.

Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and
whispers in his ear.  Gerald changes instantly -- taking on
the same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice.

Ted's story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY...

                    MAURICE
          What's wrong?

The room goes SILENT as all eyes fall on Adelle and Gerald.

                    GERALD
              (shaking)
          Maurice, can we go into the dining
          room?

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          What's happened to my wife?

This hits everyone in the room like a bomb.  A dread hangs
over every passing second... Gerald crumbles under the
moment... Adelle begins to cry.

                    GERALD
          There was a car accident... Drunk
          driver.

Some of the crowd reacts.  A women covers her mouth.  The
moment is unbearable.

                    MAURICE
              (to himself)
          Please God -- don't do this.

Gerald cracks -- the tears start to flow from his eyes.

                    GERALD
          Maurice, it was serious... I don't
          know how to --

Gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if
trying to contain an explosion in his head.

                    GERALD
          Oh Jesus, please help me... She
          didn't... Ellen didn't make it...
          Ellen's dead Maurice.

Maurice closes his eyes shut tightly... like a child scared
of the dark.

Adelle blacks out, knocking over the wine chiller on the way
to the ground.  In less than a minute the room has
transformed from a celebration to a mourning.  Everyone is
frozen staring at Maurice for their cue... A child in her
mother's arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances.

EXTREME CLOSE UP.  Maurice opens his eyes slowly.  The room
stays still as Maurice stares at Ellen's HAT sitting on the
piano.

A "FTD" Florist truck pulls up.  A delivery man, moves with
an extravagant bouquet of flowers to the front door.  He
RINGS THE DOOR BELL.  No answer.  KNOCKS.  No answer.

The delivery man looks to the ground and searches, before
placing the bouquet on the porch.

WE NOW SEE that the porch is completely covered with flowers,
bouquets and wreaths.  The delivery man tip-toes his way
through the maze of condolences and moves to his truck.

THE HOUSE IS SILENT EXCEPT FOR THE FRANTIC CHIRPING OF CLAUDE
FROM THE HALL.  His hopeless cries punctuating the air every
few seconds.

Maurice sits in a chair facing Ellen's wardrobe closet.  The
LIGHTS IN THE ROOM ARE OFF.  The room is lit only by the
LIGHT FROM THE HALLWAY STREAMING IN AT AN ANGLE.

Maurice gets up and with a great deal of uncertainty, opens
the closet.  Maurice stares at the collection of hanging
dresses.

He reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards
him... He closes his eyes and smells the cloth... his face
tightens in pain... both hands cling to the dress tightly...
he tries desperately, can't fight it -- Maurice Parker begins
to cry.

His hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses --
pressing them to his face and chest.

                    MAURICE
          Oh God... I'm sorry Ellen... I'm so
          sorry...

He hugs the dresses as if they were her.  His weeping turns
to a torturous wail of grief... all the love, all the anger
spilling out in this one moment.

He falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him
-- they collapse atop him... He buries his face in his wife's
clothes...

The MUFFLED SOUND OF HIS CRIES ECHOES through the lonely
house.

PARK BENCH

Maurice is seated on a park bench.  Across from him is an
ELDERLY COUPLE -- in their seventies.  The OLD WOMAN is frail
with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles.  The husband
is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like
a little boy.

Maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands...
Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him.
He watches as the old man gets up.  The old woman tries to
make him stay, but he playfully pulls away.  She shakes her
head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down
the path by himself.

The old woman glances Maurice's way.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Good morning.

                    MAURICE
          Good morning.

The old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing
next to the bench.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Is it a boy or a girl?

                    MAURICE
          Oh, that's not mine.

Maurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a
blanket in the grass.

                    MAURICE
          I don't have kids.

                    OLD WOMAN
          You should.  Children are a
          blessing from God.  I have four.

The old woman studies him.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Are you okay?

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          Is that your husband?

She nods, "Yes."

                    MAURICE
          You look so happy -- how long have
          you been married?

                    OLD WOMAN
          Forty-seven years.

This hits Maurice hard.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Are you married?

This hits Maurice even harder.

                    MAURICE
              (this is painful)
          Yes... Seventeen years.

The old woman looks down the path for her husband.

                    MAURICE
          Where did he go?

                    OLD WOMAN
          He's getting my sweater from the
          car.  I said there was a breeze.
              (shaking her head)
          I told him not to go.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          May I ask you a question that might
          sound strange?

                    OLD WOMAN
          Yes.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          How do you know he loves you?

The old woman looks at him oddly.

                    MAURICE
          I mean besides... time -- how did
          you know ten years ago -- twenty
          years ago?

She thinks hard... tough question.  No answer for a moment
then --

The old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye --
her husband is walking up the path with her white lace
sweater over his arm...

She smiles as the answer comes to her.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Because he shows me... he's not
          much for words, but he shows me.

Maurice sits back -- her answer lingers in the air like a
haunting voice.

Maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife
with the sweater.  The old woman waves as they continue down
the path... hand in hand.

DR. ROYCE checks a chart.  Maurice watches him from his perch
on the examination chair.

                    DR. ROYCE
          So what's the deal Maurice?

                    MAURICE
          Pardon?

                    DR. ROYCE
          I mean why the sudden voluntary
          visit  -- usually it takes gun-
          point to get you in here...

                    MAURICE
          Routine, I assure you.  I just
          wanted to gage my health.  Am I
          healthy?

                    DR. ROYCE
          Yes -- you are.

                    MAURICE
          I'm going to ask you a question
          that may sound peculiar.

Dr. Royce folds his arms and waits... What's this all about?

                    MAURICE
          How far could an individual walk if
          they had no athletic training --
          you understand, just an ordinary
          person?

Dr. Royce stares at him suspiciously.

                    DR. ROYCE
          I know what you're getting at.

                    MAURICE
          You do?

                    DR. ROYCE
          I've seen it before.

                    MAURICE
          You have?

                    DR. ROYCE
          You're feeling old and you want to
          start exercising.  A lot of men
          your age feel the need to recapture
          their youth.  Don't feel
          embarrassed about it.

                    MAURICE
              (playing along)
          Okay.

                    DR. ROYCE
          You should start slow and easy --
          fifteen minutes a day.

                    MAURICE
          No.  How far in one attempt --
          what's the farthest someone like
          myself could walk?

The doctor is confused again.

                    MAURICE
          Just for curiosity sake that's all?

                    DR. ROYCE
          I don't know -- maybe twenty
          miles... Of course I'm not
          recommending that... if someone
          like you had to I mean... that's
          how far they'd probably get before
          encountering serious physical
          walls.

                    MAURICE
          Twenty miles?  I see.

Maurice thinks about it carefully as the doctor returns to

          Damn baby, relax.  I'm getting to

              (taking on a rehearsed
               tone)
          From Philadelphia following the
          route highlighted to Pacifica
          California -- you're traveling an
          estimated three thousand two
          hundred miles...

Maurice is a bit pale.  He follows the yellow highlighted
highways winding it's way across the U.S.

                    MAURICE
          Three thousand miles?... How many
          times does twenty go into three
          thousand?

                    JOSELLE
          What was that?

                    MAURICE
          Perhaps there's another route?

                    JOSELLE
          This is the route approved by
          triple A.  Even if you followed
          back roads the entire way, you'd
          still be looking at roughly the
          same distance...

Joselle studies his concerned expression.

                    JOSELLE
          Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take
          you more than five days if you just
          stop to sleep and eat.

Joselle scrunches her face in exaggerated shock and takes a
step back to look Maurice up and down.

                    JOSELLE

Maurice gives her a sad expression.  If she only knew.

Kris unloads the last of a shipment of books.  He moves to
Maurice who sits by the window to the street.  Maurice points
to a chair across from him and Kris takes a seat.

          Why do you want to be a journalist
          Kris?  What sparked your interest?

Beat.

                    KRIS
          I want to reach people.  Nobody
          listens to me.  This is my way to
          reach them.

                    MAURICE
          To reach people, you have to feel
          something first... You write about
          the wrong things.  How can you feel
          for dog food?  The people at the
          Gazette don't respect it, and
          neither do you.

                    KRIS
          This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever
          happens.

                    MAURICE

the coffee table between them.  He hands it to Kris.

Kris opens the envelope and finds money.

                    MAURICE
          It's one month's pay.

Kris gets up.  A shock of adrenaline hits him.

                    KRIS
          Are you firing me?

                    MAURICE
          No.  No... I won't be here for a
          while.  The store will be closed in
          the interim.

Kris grabs his coat, shifting his attention between the
window and Maurice?

Kris moves to the door.

          When are you leaving?

                    MAURICE

Kris is seriously confused now.  Maurice decides to end the
confusion.

                    MAURICE
          I'm walking there Kris.

                    KRIS
          Walking where?

                    MAURICE
          California.

Kris' jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across
the street.  Kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his
forearm.

                    KRIS
          The hairs on my arm are standing
          up... Something strange is
          happening.

          actually became a couple -- this
          was a beautiful place to begin
          things.

Maurice is bright red.  Ellen giggles at his shyness.
Maurice gathers his strength and looks her straight in the
eyes.

Maurice leans forward and kisses her softly.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

A topless CHERRY RED WRANGLER JEEP pulls out of a mechanic's
garage and moves down route 32.  Kris Reddy is at the wheel.
A "Daily Gazette" sign flaps from his roll-bar.

Kris changes the station on the radio as his eye catches a
man walking on the opposite side of the street... Kris turns
back to the road -- mind racing... BRAKES SCREECH as the jeep
slows and then RUMBLES over the island separating the
lanes... making a U turn across a four lane highway.

Maurice wiping his brow with a handkerchief.  The Wrangler
jeep rolls up next to him as he walks.  Maurice doesn't stop
walking as Kris leans over the passenger seat.

          Phileas Fogg?

                    MAURICE
              (looking ahead)
          ... Round The World In Eighty Days.
          ... Hello Kris.

                    KRIS
          You're amazing... What are you
          doing Mr. Parker?

                    MAURICE
          I told you.

Beat.  Cars HONK as they pull by the slow duo.

                    KRIS
          You're walking to California?

                    MAURICE
          Pacifica, California -- it's a
          coastal city.

                    KRIS
          Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.

Kris looks around to see if anyone else sees the lunacy in
this moment.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen told me that she didn't know
          if I loved her.

                    KRIS
          She knew you loved her.

                    MAURICE
          She wasn't certain... I never
          really showed her.

Beat.

                    KRIS
          I'm really lost.  What does this
          have to do with walking?

                    MAURICE
          I said, 'I would do anything for
          her'... and she didn't believe me.
          I said, 'I'd walk across the
          country for her'... she didn't
          believe me.

Maurice looks to Kris rolling along beside him.  He sees the
worried expression on his face.

                    MAURICE
          I need to show her how much I love
          her Kris.

                    KRIS
          Why know?

                    MAURICE
          Because I should have shown her
          before... Everyday, I should have
          shown her.

Beat.

                    KRIS
          Pacifica, California... that's a
          long ways away.

                    MAURICE
          So I've been informed.

Kris tries to act calm, but it doesn't last long.

                    KRIS
          Shit Mr. Parker.  You can't walk
          across the United States -- it's
          over three thousand miles.

Maurice takes his time with the response.  Kris waves more
cars to pass them.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen got up every morning and went
          to the corner store to get me my
          bread for breakfast... Everyday.
          Now that's about a quarter mile
          each way... 17 years... that comes
          to about three thousand miles...
              (he smiles to himself)
          And you know what Kris?

                    KRIS
          What Mr. Parker?

                    MAURICE
          She never ate a slice.

Maurice picks up speed -- surer with every step... Kris slows
the jeep to a stop and reaches into his bag.  The mini tape
recorder goes on with a CLICK.

Kris watches through the windshield as Mr. Parker disappears

Maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands -- grimacing from

The steam from the water fills the room.

Maurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each

Maurice as he walks down a winding highway.  His new sneakers
shuffling slowly.

A SHARP PAIN SHOOTS UP MAURICE'S LEG.  His knees buckle.  The
shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by Maurice
himself.  From a distance it looks like he's been shot.

Maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten
his leg out... His face frozen in a painful expression.
Maurice rubs his legs slowly -- working the cramp out.  He
relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg.  Maurice
sits there motionless -- eyes glazed... defeated.

The SOUNDS OF A BIRD snap him out of his trance.  He looks up
to see a PAINTED BUNTING, a bird about six inches in height
FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice
stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed
with brilliant blues, reds and greens.  It looks out of place
in these mundane surroundings.  Maurice looks around the
skies to see no other birds.  The Painted Bunting chirps a
few times before taking flight into the air.  It circles over
Maurice before disappearing behind the trees.

Maurice smiles.  He pulls himself to his feet with great
effort.

Maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the
essentials -- the maps, food, a canister of water.

Maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with
great effort.  At his feet, are the rest of his belonging --
piled on the side of the road.

Maurice painfully begins walking again.

WE PULL BACK on Maurice's figure walking on the highway...
the pile of disregarded things laying by the side... The
highway is endless... winding it's way for miles and miles
into a fixed dot in the distance.

          Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I
          know the difference between normal
          whims people have and actions that
          clearly display psychological
          problems... My uncle lost his wife
          and it devastated him.

          We're very sorry about that.  Some

                    ADELLE
          I think my uncle is suffering from
          a condition called Mania which is
          linked with depression.  It is a
          time when an individual will act
          over-confident, and will act out
          impractical, grandiose plans.
          Sometimes these plans can be
          dangerous.

          A couple days to a few months if
          untreated.

Dally digests this information.

                    DALLY
          Look, I'll see if anyone has
          spotted him recently.  If I get any
          information, I'll call you.

          Thank you.

Adelle looks very emotional... on the verge of tears.

his tiny tears with her hand and hugs him tenderly.  The
little boy's head cradled in her arms.

EXT.  FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The Parker house many years ago.  The house semi-furnished.
Ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall;
a striking aerial photo of a GOLDEN EAGLE.  Wings spread,
soaring high over a mountain range.

                    MAURICE
          I thought we both wanted the same
          things.

                    ELLEN
          I've changed my mind.

                    MAURICE
          You can't change your mind.

Beat.  Ellen takes a seat on the only sofa.

                    ELLEN
          I want children.

                    MAURICE
          You've just decided, is that right?

                    ELLEN
          Yes.

Young Maurice is visibly upset.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen, there are two kinds of
          people in the world --

                    ELLEN
          Please not, 'The two kinds of
          people' speech.

                    MAURICE
          ... People that were made to be
          parents, and people who were not
          made to be parents... My parents,
          were people who were not made to be
          parents but had kids anyway.  I
          don't want us to be that way Ellen.

                    ELLEN
          You can change.

                    MAURICE
          Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of
          person who reads bedtime stories.
          But you love me anyway.

                    ELLEN
              (upset)
          Don't be so sure.

Ellen fiddles with her dress.  She bites her bottom lip as
she tries not to cry.

                    ELLEN
              (shaky voice)
          What if something happens to one of
          us?  We'll be all alone.

Maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her.  He
lays his hand across her shoulder.

                    MAURICE
          Nothing will happen to us.  It's a
          bleak picture, I know, but we're
          going to be together till were old
          and grey and you don't remember my
          name anymore.

Maurice lifts her chin with his hand gently.  She blinks her
eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek.  He takes a deep
breath.

                    MAURICE
          Let me think about it okay.

Ellen brightens up immediately.

                    MAURICE
          I'm not saying anytime soon.  I'm
          just saying that maybe we can
          consider it down the road sometime.

Ellen gives her patented glowing smile.  She hugs him with
all her strength.  She whispers in his ear.

                    ELLEN
          I love you Maurice Parker.

EXT.  INDIANA GRADE SCHOOL - DAY (PRESENT)

Maurice walks away from the school, shuffling through the
piles of leaves that block the walkways.

A child and her father walk down the path towards him.
Maurice looks away painfully.  THE CHILD'S SOFT LAUGHTER
POUNDING IN HIS EARS as he quickens his pace.

INT.  LIQUOR STORE - DAY

JACKSON LIQUOR WHOLESALERS.  For the kind of people who buy
whiskey by the crate.

Maurice has his map unfolded over the cash register.

                    CASHIER
          I can show you the main roads, but
          that'll add ten miles to your trip.
          Do you mind ten miles?

                    MAURICE
          I mind.

                                                  CUT TO:

OUTSIDE OF LIQUOR STORE

The parking lot of the store looks like a used truck lot.
Every kind of supped-up truck one could possibly imagine is
on display here.

Maurice passes a CANARY YELLOW FLATBED PICK-UP with a group
of men drinking a newly purchased case of beer.  Maurice gets
about ten feet past them when he stops, hesitates and then
heads back to them.

                    MAURICE
          Excuse me, who's truck is this?

The man sitting on the hood of the truck, has dark hair and
hasn't shaven in days.  This unfortunate gentleman is named
DENNY.

                    DENNY
          Mine.

                    MAURICE
          Are you and your friends planning
          on driving soon?

Denny gives Maurice a greasy curious look.  He squints his
glazed eyes.

                    DENNY
          Yes we are.  Who the fuck are you?

Maurice, doesn't look scared, in fact he looks angered.

                    MAURICE
          You don't know me from Adam, but I
          want you to do something for me.  I
          want you to wait until you sobered
          up before you get behind the wheel.
          I know this is out of the ordinary,
          but one man to another, would you
          do me that favor?

Silence.  Then everyone in the group BURSTS OUT IN DRUNKEN
LAUGHTER.

                    DENNY
          Are you a preacher?

                    MAURICE
              (seething with anger)
          No, I just don't want anybody dying
          because I didn't say something when
          I had the chance.

Denny's face goes blank.  No emotion.  His steady gaze almost
terrifying.

                    DENNY
          I'll drive my truck shit-faced if I
          want to.  You better turn around
          and walk away preacher.  You don't
          know who you're talking to.

Maurice looks around at the hostile faces and decides on a
retreat.  Denny watches Maurice with predatory eyes.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DUSK

Maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by
towering pines.  He stops to take a drink from his canister
and keeps walking.  The SOUNDS OF A CAR GROW IN THE DISTANCE.
Maurice doesn't turn his back.

The CANARY YELLOW TRUCK pulls over the ridge with a load full
of passengers.  It gains distance on Maurice.

Maurice hears the ENGINE and waves HIS ARM IN THE AIR --
signaling for it to pass him.  Maurice walks ten more feet
before turning around.

Maurice's face instantly changes when he sees the demented
grins through the windshield of the truck.  Maurice turns and
quickens his pace... The truck picks up pace... Maurice
breaks into a run... The truck speeds up, passes Maurice and
stops in front of him.

Panic fills Maurice as he watches the truck unload it's
drunken passengers.  Eyes scan the forest on either side for
a way out.  Maurice decides to stand his ground.

                    MAURICE
              (to himself)
          This is Indiana -- nothing's going
          to happen to you.

                    DENNY
          You need a ride, Preacher?

The men walk up to Maurice.

                    MAURICE
          No thank you I'll walk.

A tall lanky gentleman gestures to Maurice's shoulder bag
with his beer can.  Some beer sprays Maurice's feet with the
gesture.

                    WIL
          Where you coming from?

                    MAURICE
          Look gentlemen, I'm late, I need
          to --

                    DENNY
          I've been thinking -- who the hell
          is this preacher guy?  Coming up to
          me and my friends?  Looking like he
          wanted to kick my ass for drinking?

Denny gives Maurice that inhuman stare.  Maurice is clearly
frightened.

                    DENNY
          Then I figured it.  You're angry.
          You lost somebody, because some
          asshole was drinking.

Maurice is frozen.

                    DENNY
          Maybe you lost a son?  A sister?  A
          wife?

Maurice looks up for a millisecond.  Denny doesn't miss it.

                    DENNY
              (stepping closer)
          A wife?... Did someone piss drunk
          run into your wife?  Crushed her
          like a bug.  Snapped her bones?

                    MAURICE
          That's enough.

Maurice is red with anger.  Denny loves it.

                    DENNY
          Oh the preacher's getting angry
          again...
              (Denny goes ice cold)
          Tell me something.  Did she die
          instantly or did she feel every
          torn muscle and shattered bone?
          Were you there to help her?  Or
          were you safe at home when the
          windshield sliced into her face --

                    MAURICE
          I'll kill you!

Maurice swings.  Denny easily avoids it.  Maurice doesn't see
the first BLOW COMING, IT HITS HIM IN THE CHEST -- Maurice
gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt.  Hands grab --
restrain.  A POWERFUL KICK IN THE RIBS -- ANOTHER...
LAUGHTER... ANOTHER SET OF VICIOUS KICKS... The road and
forest begin to spin... A PAINFUL SLASH ACROSS HIS FACE...

Maurice prepares for the next blow... it never comes.  RED
AND BLUE lights swirl... Maurice looks up, barely focusing --
a man leans over a car door... The image becomes clearer -- a
POLICEMAN stands poised -- gun aimed directly at the men
hovering over him.

                    POLICE OFFICER
              (distorted and slowed)
          Step away from him now!

Gesturing to a young officer at another desk to come over.
Dally, cups the phone.

The sea of desks are empty.  One empty desk is lit -- Kris
Reddy's desk.  THE CRACKLE OF A SHORTWAVE/C.B. UNIT FLOATS
THROUGH THE LARGE UNOCCUPIED ROOM from an adjacent room.  The
VOICES OF DALLY AND OFFICER GREY ARE DISTORTED BUT AUDIBLE.

WE MOVE TO the back room to find Kris writing furiously in
front of an elaborate C.B. setup.

He jots down the words as fast as they're said:

  "Maurice Parker... Elkhart... Route 80... Precinct 18..."

The transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends.
Kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map
off the shelf.

The map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog
as Kris traces the route from Philadelphia to Indiana... He
sits up straight in astonishment as his eyes hit the KEY of
the map.

                    KRIS
          Jesus -- he's walked six hundred
          miles.

Kris glances at the hairs on his arm and smiles.

Kris at his computer and in the 'zone.'  Fingers flying over

EXT.  INDIANA POLICE STATION - MORNING

Maurice and Officer Grey are seated on the front stairs of
the precinct drinking coffee when ADELLE MATLIN DRIVES UP.

Adelle steps out of a RENTED TOYOTA CELICA.  Her tense --
frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten
hours.  She walks to the stairs.

                    GREY
          Mrs. Matlin... good morning.

Maurice slowly gets up.  Adelle is in shock as she looks at
the stranger before her.

Maurice stands in a 'COLTS' football T-shirt, faded jeans and
sneakers.  His left cheek is black and blue, and his arm and
side are bandaged.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle Maurice, you're wearing
          sneakers?

                    MAURICE
          High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with
          heel support and air-cushioned
          soles.  They're nasty.

Adelle wasn't sure what that meant.  She shakes it off and
hugs Maurice.  She is visibly relieved to have him in her
arms.

                    GREY
          My shift ended an hour ago.

Adelle notices the ROSE in Grey's hand.  Grey catches her
glance.

                    GREY
          It's for my wife.

                    ADELLE
          What's the occasion?

Grey looks to Maurice -- they exchange a knowing smile.

                    GREY
          No occasion.

Adelle notices the WINK exchanged between Grey and Maurice.

                    GREY
          You can use the conference room, if
          you want to talk.

                    ADELLE
          That won't be necessary.

                    GREY
          Fine.

                    ADELLE
          We can talk on the way back -- I
          rented a car.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          It'll be kind of hard to talk,
          since you'll be in the car and I
          won't.

Adelle gives Maurice an angry glare -- Maurice holds his
ground.

          And your store?  What about your
          new store?  What about all your
          dreams?

                    MAURICE
          I have new dreams now.

                    ADELLE
          I don't accept that.

                    MAURICE
          Maybe one day -- after you've been
          married twenty years you'll
          understand.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our
          frequent flyer miles on a one way
          ticket here... I have a rented car
          outside, just listen to me.
              (beat)
          Come back with me now, and if you
          still want to do something like
          this in a year -- maybe we'll plan
          a car trip across the country --
          Gerald and I will come along --

                    MAURICE
          I have to walk -- by myself -- all
          the way -- every inch.

                    ADELLE
          It's impossible.

                    MAURICE
          It's what she asked for... It's
          what I'm going to do.

                    ADELLE
          She was being symbolic.  What if
          she asked you to fly to the moon?

                    MAURICE
          You'd be visiting me at Nasa.

Adelle changes gears.  She takes a seat next to Maurice and
studies his legs and tired face carefully before uttering the
words.

                    ADELLE
              (whispering)
          What if you don't make it?

                    MAURICE
          I'll make it.

                    ADELLE
          If you really want to do this...
          plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for
          it.  Build up your body.  Plan
          every stop along the way.  How much
          money?  Time?  Really do it
          properly.  This is all so -- by the
          seat of your pants.

                    MAURICE
          No it's not.

                    ADELLE
          Why did you take the back roads
          here?  They're not safe.  You'd
          know that if you'd planned.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          I've all ready gone six hundred
          miles... I can't do it again.

                    ADELLE
          If you can't redo these six hundred
          miles when you're rested and ready,
          how are you possible going to walk
          another two thousand-five hundred
          miles in your present condition?

Maurice is stumped.  He looks unsure.  He instantly looks on
the verge of tears.

                    MAURICE
          Nothing's going to happen.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle, the way I was told, if that
          police car didn't happen down that
          road, you would be dead right now.
          That guy Denny, had jumped bail in
          another state, he's dangerous...
          They'll be other Dennys, if you
          don't plan.

Maurice stares down at the table -- the life draining from
him with every word she says.

                    ADELLE
          Ellen, deserves you to do this
          right.  Really make it -- if you're
          going to do it.  She deserves it.

Maurice is stretched out in the back -- his legs propped up

His sad eyes watching the passing scenery.  The speeding car
swallows up the miles effortlessly.  Maurice watches the
Jackson Liquor Wholesalers whiz by... The painful hills he
climbed, gone, in an instant... The school where he watched
the children being dropped off, swishes by in a blink... all
those miles lost.

Maurice shuts his eyes in pain.

Maurice is seated in the back staring out at the eighteen
wheelers that come in and out of the parking lot.  He glances
in to Adelle who is gathering food.

Maurice's dull eyes are about to shut when something catches
his attention.  He sits up and stares out the window with
great intensity.  Maurice watches as a large truck pulls into
the parking lot, across it's side in blazing red --

          "Jackson Liquor Wholesalers - Since 1945"

Maurice scans the area... gas station ATTENDANTS... A BEARDED
HOMELESS MAN laying next to a heating unit... KIDS eating
fast food on old picnic tables...

Maurice's gaze steadies on the TRUCK, as the driver fills the
tank with gas.

A PHONE BOOTH INSIDE THE CONVENIENCE STORE

Adelle is on the phone.

                    ADELLE
          We'll figure everything out when we
          get there... Oh, he's going to need
          a lot of help with this... He
          wasn't even going to come with me,
          I had to tell him that he could do
          the walk later if he plans well...
          I know, but by that time I'll have
          gotten him some treatment... I just
          want to get back home before he
          changes his mind.

                                                  CUT TO:

CAR - LATER

Adelle gets in the front seat of the car keeping the bag of
food on the passenger seat.  She starts the car as she talks
into the rearview mirror.

                    ADELLE
          You want something to eat?

She stares at Maurice covered in a blanket with his back to
her... an unresponsive blob.

                    ADELLE
          I know you're feeling a lot of
          emotions right now.  It's okay to
          be mad.  It's okay to feel
          helpless.  It's part of the healing
          process.  I understand.  I do.

Adelle puts the Celica into drive and pulls out onto the
highway.

EXT.  ADELLE'S HOUSE - EVENING

Evening in Philadelphia.  The rented Toyota Celica pulls into
the driveway.  The front door of the house opens.  Gerald
walks out to greet them.

A tired Adelle slips out of the car and hugs Gerald.

                    ADELLE
          He was exhausted -- slept the whole
          way.

Adelle and Gerald move to the back door of the Celica.  They
open it and stare at Maurice covered by the blanket.  Adelle
shakes the blanket.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle Maurice we're home... Uncle
          Maurice.

Adelle shakes Maurice, who stirs a little as he wakes.  His
feet slide out from under the blanket -- Adelle stares
curiously at the ARMY COMBAT BOOTS that dangle out.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle Maurice?

Adelle pulls aside the covers... THE HOMELESS MAN, from the
gas station, sits up.  ADELLE'S SHRILL SCREAM BLASTS THROUGH
THE AIR.  Gerald and Adelle stumble back as the large,
bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the
quiet neighborhood.

                    HOMELESS MAN
          So this is the City of Brotherly
          Love.

The homeless man raises his hand.  He holds up MAURICE'S WELL
POLISHED BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION and kisses it lovingly.

Adelle and Gerald stare back speechless.

EXT.  ROAD - MORNING

Maurice back on the road.  His limp only slightly visible at
this point in the day.  The bandages rubbing him with every
step.

The highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees.  THE
AIR IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF BIRDS.  Maurice spots a
YELLOW WARBLER, a striking bird about eight inches long with
vivid yellow feathers.  It sits elegantly on a nearby branch.
He walks towards it -- it stays in position.  Closer.  The
bird chirps back at him.  Maurice is within arms reach of the
bird.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen would have loved you.

Maurice looks closer -- and notices it's wings.  The feathers
bend back -- a dark area at the center.

                    MAURICE
          How did that happen?

Maurice watches the bird hop around the branch -- unable to
fly.

INT.  PARKER KITCHEN - FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER (FLASHBACK)

The kitchen is a different color.  The refrigerator and
appliances are brand new.  Ellen walks in -- something
cradled in her hand.  Maurice looks up from his paper to see
Ellen move to the sink and lay a motionless bird on the
counter.

                    ELLEN
              (shaky voice)
          It must've hit the window... I
          think its neck is broken.

                    MAURICE
          Don't bring it in here -- it
          probably has all kinds of diseases.

Ellen finds an eye dropper from the table and fills it with
water -- she lets a few drops fall into the birds mouth.

                                                  CUT TO:

BEDROOM

Evening, just before bed.  Maurice is reading.  Ellen is
monitoring the bird closely.  It lays on the bedside table --
wrapped gently with a hand towel.  A morsel of food is
lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers.  The bird
stares blankly at the ceiling.

                    MAURICE
          It isn't going to make it Ellen.
          Let the poor thing go quietly.

                    ELLEN
          It'll make it.

Her delicate hand rubs the bird's stomach.

LIVING ROOM

The GRAPHIC IMAGES of the TV FLICKER on Maurice's face.  He
glances back to Ellen who talks to the bird cradled in her
arms.

                    ELLEN
              (softly)
          You must miss flying.  Being way up
          there in the clouds looking down at
          all of us.  You miss that don't
          you?  You miss playing with your
          friends and talking with them...

In the SOFT LIGHT of the lamp -- Ellen has transformed into a
mother rocking her child to sleep.

Maurice is reading his paper.

                    ELLEN

Maurice looks through the window to see Ellen waving to him
frantically.

BACKYARD

Ellen points to the ground.  The little bird awkwardly walks
around the porch.

The bird's wings BURST into motion -- flapping hard --
catching the wind.  Ellen jumps up and down, bursting with
pride, as her little child takes flight.

                    MAURICE
          I don't believe it.

Ellen hugs Maurice.

                    ELLEN
          All he needed was love.  Once you
          have that, you can do anything.

Young Maurice and Ellen watch the bird soar into the blue
sky.

Maurice is kneeling at a stream by the side of the road.  He
gently clears away the dirt from the Yellow Warbler's
feathers.

          You'll be all right.  A couple days
          and you'll be up there again.

Maurice carries the bird back to the trees.  He lays it back
on the branch.  He stares at it's beautiful coat with a
smile.

                    MAURICE
          Ellen would have loved you.

INT.  ADELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

Adelle is on the cordless.  Her fingers tapping on the
kitchen table angrily.  Gerald moves around her as he sets
two plates at the table.

                    ADELLE
          Yes I understand, it does sound
          humorous, but this is a very
          serious situation.

Gerald is cooking.  He gently flips the chicken breast in a
butter and garlic sauce.

                    GERALD
          This smells good.

                    ADELLE
          Why am I such an authority?

                    GERALD
              (under his breath)
          Here comes the resume.

                    ADELLE
          I received my B.S. from the
          University of Pennsylvania, my
          P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I
          worked three years at the Boston
          University School of Medicine,
          during which time I had articles
          printed in the "Journal of
          Educational Psychology", "American
          Journal of Psychology", "Psychology
          Review" and "Science"... So I think
          it's safe to say my opinion is
          valid.

Gerald brings the sizzling pan over and divides the steaming
dish into both plates.

                    ADELLE
          Look, please find him for me...
          Officer, I tried... but I brought
          back the wrong person.

Gerald quickly scoops some rice onto both plates.  His mouth
is watering as he goes for the utensils.

Adelle abruptly stands at her place.

                    ADELLE
          Stop laughing!

Gerald gets into his seat at the table just in time to see
Adelle angrily hang up the phone.  She stares off into space
before unconsciously cleaning the table.  Adelle picks up
both plates of food...

                    GERALD
          Adelle --

Gerald's heart sinks as Adelle pops open the trash can with a
tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the
garbage.  She goes to the sink and rinses the plates
completely preoccupied with her thoughts.  She mumbles to
herself as she shuts off the water.

                    ADELLE
          He says he admires him.

Adelle storms out of the kitchen.  Gerald sits at the empty
table with a fork in his hands.  He shakes his head in
disbelief.

EXT.  MIDWEST HIGHWAYS - DAY

The land is flat.  From the roads one can see endless fields
in all directions.  When the wind blows, the crops bend in
unison, changing the shape and texture of the land for a
moment and instantly changing back with a snap of the wind.

Maurice takes in the beauty of the land through a painful
grimace.  Occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of
extreme pain.

Maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road
and watches the wind change the fields.  He closes his jacket
as the gusts become stronger.

The clock clicks past 11:30 am.  Maurice is still in bed --
the curtains drawn.  He crawls out from under the sheets and
downs two pills with a glass of water.  He looks bad.  His
face pale, his eyes at half-mast.  He wipes unnatural sweat
from his brow and melts into the bed again.

STREET

Just after dusk.  A small town's main road.  Maurice quietly
passes under the street lights.

He stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first
SNOWFLAKE falls into the SHAFT OF THE STREET LIGHT.  Soon
thousands of flakes fall into the light...

A PICTURE of Maurice standing outside his bookstore holding
up THE BOOK SOCIETY MEDALLION proudly.

A teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous
bag over his shoulder... emblazoned across his back are the
words "MAIL ROOM."  The boy comes to Kris and empties the bag
on Kris' desk without a word.  Hundreds of letters cascade
down swallowing the table top and covering Kris who stares in
awe as the letters keep coming.

Maurice is COUGHING PAINFULLY.  He crouches over the edge of
the bed and holds his side with every strain.

Maurice looks worse than ever.  His hair and shirt are soaked
with sweat.  The coughing attack stops.  Maurice take a
couple deep breaths before laying back down.

His feet are visible -- sticking out from beneath the sheets.
They look like someone has beaten them with a stick, swollen
and bruised.  They disappear under the sheets.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Early morning.  The branches of the trees are encapsulated in
ice.  The snow piled ten inches on every surface.  Maurice,
buried deep beneath three layers of clothes, looks around.
His breath materializes with every step.  He forces a weak
smile at the magical landscape before him.  White.  Pure.
Peaceful.

The SOUNDS OF A VOLVO STATION WAGON urges Maurice to the side
of the road.  As it passes a little girl waves from the
passenger window.  Maurice puts on a brave face and waves
back.

Another CAR ENTERS the picture -- A DARK BLUE FIREBIRD rises
over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast, too fast.

SLOW-MOTION as the Firebird skids over the ice and the snow
-- the driver desperately trying to gain control... The
mother in the Volvo hits the BRAKES as the Firebird spins
into her lane... Maurice yells out.

                    MAURICE
          No!

The cars IMPACT with a sickening CRUNCH -- BACK TO REAL TIME:

The Firebird spins into a guardrail, breaking through it and
coming to a stop in a bank of snow.

The Volvo isn't so lucky.  It flips from the impact...
sliding on its roof, driving through the snow, down the
road... It comes to a rest a hundred feet away.

SILENCE.  STILLNESS.  The entire event took only seconds.

Maurice runs frantically after the Volvo.  The windows are
SHATTERED.  Snow has packed into the over-turned car.  No one
can be seen inside the vehicle.

Maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his
hand.  His arm disappears up to the shoulder.  His face
grimacing with the strain.  His arm comes out slowly...

A few MUFFLED SOBS ARE HEARD BEFORE the little girl breaks
through the wall of snow and slides out of the window.  She
lets out a DESPERATE GASP for air as Maurice pulls her out by
the wrist.

Maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs.

                    MAURICE
              (panting)
          It's okay.  It's all over.

Maurice lays her gently against a snow bank, before moving to
the other side of the car.

                    DRIVER (O.S.)
          Is she okay?

Maurice looks up to see the driver of the Firebird walking
towards him.  He looks dazed.

Maurice doesn't waste another second and plunges his arm in
the snow... deeper than before.  His cheek pressed against
the snow, almost laying flat on the ground.

                    MAURICE
              (frantic)
          Oh no... she's wearing a seat-belt.

Maurice fishes around... his teeth clenched... He lets out a
POWERFUL GRUNT as he pulls back with all his strength -- a
woman's WRIST appears first, then the tangled hair and then
the body spills out onto the road next to Maurice.

The driver appears over the Woman and Maurice and loses it
when he sees them.

                    DRIVER
          It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my
          fault.

Maurice, out of breath, clears the woman's face and mouth --
no movement.  No sound.

                    MAURICE
          Come on... please...

Maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth...

                    MAURICE
          Please...

She doesn't respond.

A FRIGHTENING FLASH

The mother's UNCONSCIOUS face turns into ELLEN.  Her lifeless
eyes -- her bruised cheek and forehead.  Her neck at an
awkward angle.  Maurice stares down at his wife in horror.

          No Ellen... don't die...

push, count, breath... push, count, breath...

The mother's BODY TWITCHES, slightly at first -- then
obviously... The mother let's out a FEW PAINFUL COUGHS.

She takes a breath.  Life quickly returns to her body.
Maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her, lightly
rocking back and forth.  The tears streaming down his red
face.

                    MAURICE
          Everything's going to be fine
          Ellen.  I won't let anything happen
          to you.  I love you sweetie.
          Everything's going to be different

The SCENE BACKS OUT as Maurice comforts this stranger in his
arms.

The police have descended on the scene.  Traffic has been
blocked off in both directions.  The LIGHT thrown by the

Maurice's face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of
a police car.

OUTSIDE THE CAR

OFFICER HANSEN AND OFFICER TANDY converse.

                    HANSEN
          What's his story?

                    TANDY
          His name is Maurice.  He's dancing
          around everything else.

                    HANSEN
          Red flag, man.

                    TANDY
          If he's in trouble with the law --
          fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked
          two people from a car wreck, let's
          give him some space.

Hansen looks in at the drawn, exhausted face of Maurice
through the window.  Hansen opens the back door.

                    HANSEN
          Maurice, you need anything?  Which
          way were you headed?  We can drive
          you.

                    MAURICE
          No thank you officer.  I'll walk.

Hansen throws a sharp glance to Tandy.  Hansen turns back to
Maurice.

                    HANSEN
          Grub?  Food?  How about food?  Our
          dime at the local diner...

Maurice mulls this offer.

                    HANSEN
          Come on man, you're a hero.  In
          Nebraska we don't let hero's walk
          around with empty stomachs.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          ... I need to be brought back here.

The end of the meal.  Maurice sits in a booth across from
Hansen and Tandy.  They watch as Maurice coughs violently
into his napkin.

                    HANSEN
          You look like shit Maurice.

Maurice takes a couple strained breaths.

                    MAURICE
          Getting old.

                    TANDY
          How long have you been footing it
          Maurice?

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          Too long...
              (looks around)
          Excuse me gentlemen.

Maurice gets up and heads to the bathroom.  Hansen and Tandy
stare at Maurice's shoulder bag laying on his seat.

                    HANSEN
          Red flags man.

                    TANDY
          Not our problem.

                    HANSEN
          Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He
          could be somebody hot.

                    TANDY
          Not our problem.

                    HANSEN
          It's going to look beautiful when
          he turns out to be that animal who
          paid a visit to the Steadman's
          house.

                    TANDY
          This guy's not a murderer.

                    HANSEN
          If he is, half the town has seen us
          take him out for dinner like a
          couple of jack-asses.

That makes Tandy think.

                    HANSEN
          If he's clean, he'll never know
          about it.

Tandy looks to the men's bathroom door.

                    TANDY
          Do it quick.

Hansen instantly reaches over and begins rummaging through
the shoulder bag.  Hansen pulls out a little folder.  He
opens the folder to reveal an old certificate.  Hansen shows
Tandy the worn piece of paper.

                    HANSEN
          A marriage certificate?  Who the
          hell carries their marriage
          certificate around?

                    TANDY
          Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was
          issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice
          Parker has come a long way from
          home.  Why?

Hansen returns the certificate and folder to the bag and
leaves the booth quickly.

Maurice returns to the table to find only Tandy seated.
Maurice sees Hansen in the phone booth at the far end of the
diner.

Sergeant Dally packs his things to leave.  He sees the light
on LINE 1 LIGHT UP on his phone.  He ignores it.  The clerk
sticks her head around the corner.

          Line one Sarg.

                    DALLY
          I'm not here.

Dally zips his coat.

                    CLERK
          It's the Nebraska state police.

                    DALLY
          Nebraska?

                    CLERK
          You know somebody named -- Maurice
          Parker?

Dally freezes.  He shakes his head as he unzips his jacket.

                    DALLY

          That son of a bitch made it to

          What is it?

Michelle just points down the hall.

Kris stands, jaw hanging wide open.

Michelle checks her notes.

          Hansen, apparently this guy Parker
          lost his wife and went a little
          fruity.  I spoke with his niece,
          Adelle Matlin and she says to
          restrain him.  That he's dangerous
          to himself.  She says to call when
          we have him in the station.

The ride progresses in silence.  Hansen and Tandy in the
front seat.  Maurice's head is pressed against the back-seat
window.  His eyes begin to shut slightly as sleep overcomes
him.  The car goes over a BUMP.  Maurice jars awake.  He
glances out the window to see a highway sign swish by in the
HEADLIGHTS.  'ROUTE 80 EAST'.

East?  Maurice looks around quickly at the passing scenery.

                    MAURICE
          Where are you taking me?

Hansen and Tandy exchange looks.

                    HANSEN
          I'm going to drop off Tandy at the
          station and then drop you back.

                    TANDY
          That's all right isn't it?

                    MAURICE
          Sure.

Hansen looks back to the road.  The drive continues in
silence.  Tandy checks his watch just when a CLICK -- A HARD
WIND -- AND A METALLIC SLAM in quick succession shakes the
car.

                    HANSEN
          What the hell was that?

Tandy looks back -- Maurice is GONE.  The back seat empty.
Tandy stares out the blackness of the back window.

                    TANDY
          Shit!  He jumped!

                    HANSEN
          Jumped where?

Maurice staggers through the naked trees.  Thin trees every
few feet with no branches.  The snow ankle deep.

Maurice braces himself against a trunk, checking his hands.
His vision blurs as he stares down at his scraped bloody
palms.

The forest clears quickly into an open field.  Far in the
distance across the field of white is a small pointed
building standing alone.  The glow of a LIGHT can be seen
through the windows.

Maurice trudges through the deeper snow.  Stumbling many
times.  The frigid wind pushing him to his knees.  Maurice
keeps moving -- the field seems endless...

Maurice's feet hit the snow of the driveway, just as his legs
buckle -- his face HITS the snow hard.  He manages to roll
over on his back with great effort.  He stares up at the
pointed building -- the dull light becoming duller...
something blocks the light.  A man.  Maurice feels himself
rise into the air as two powerful arms scoop him off the ice.

A PRIEST carries him into the doors of a CHURCH.

INT.  BACK ROOM OF CHURCH - NIGHT

A dimly lit cathedral.  Six foot six, FATHER BERCHMAN walks
down the center isle of the cathedral, through a cloth
curtain and into a

BACK ROOM

where Maurice is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket.

                    MAURICE
          What did they ask?

                    FATHER
          If I had seen you.  By the way I'm
          sorry about your wife.  They told
          me.

                    MAURICE
          Thank you... I'm sorry you had to
          lie.  It must have been difficult.

                    FATHER
          I asked the officers if you had
          committed some crime... If they had
          said 'yes', you would be speaking
          with them right now.

This is the father's own room.  Very sparse as one would
expect.  He moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills.

                    FATHER
          Take these, and if you're up to it,
          try to explain how it is you came
          to be sitting here.

Maurice follows the father's instructions and tightens the
blanket around his shoulders.

                    MAURICE
          I'm walking for my wife.

Beat.

                    FATHER
          To where?

                    MAURICE
          Pacifica, California.

                    FATHER
          From where?

                    MAURICE
          Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

                    FATHER
          I see.

Beat.  The father nods as if this is not shocking news.

                    FATHER
          Why?

                    MAURICE
          Do you believe a person's soul
          lives on after their death?

                    FATHER
          Most certainly.

                    MAURICE
          And that that soul takes part of
          the person they were on this earth
          with them.

                    FATHER
          That's a reasonable assumption.

                    MAURICE
          I don't want my wife's soul having
          any doubts.

                    FATHER
          Doubts?  About what?

                    MAURICE
          About my love for her.

The father nods with understanding as if everything became
very clear with that statement.

                    FATHER
          You don't have to prove anything to
          her.

                    MAURICE
          I'm not proving to her.  I'm
          showing her.  And I know I don't
          have to.  I want to.  I've
          realized, love is about giving.
          I'm alive, I can still give to her.
          I want to give her everything I
          can.

The father studies this stranger before him with great
admiration.

                    MAURICE
          There are some people, including
          those officers, that are trying to
          stop me.  They mean well.  But they
          don't understand.  I wouldn't
          either if I were them.

Maurice struggles with the last words.  He slumps back --
physically drained.

The father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from
Maurice's hands.

                    FATHER
          I want you to stay here a few days
          until you're better.  You're no use
          to your wife in this condition.

The father moves for the curtain.

                    MAURICE
          You think I'm crazy too.

The father turns and smiles warmly.

                    FATHER
          I have spent my life dedicated to
          love.  Love of God.  Love of
          humanity.  And here you are living
          through love.  Bathing in it.
          Using its strength, its magic, its
          ability to overcome any barrier...
          If you are crazy, I hope my
          insanity is not far off.

Maurice's eyes well up instantly.

RESTAURANT

We are looking inside a fancy Center-City Philadelphia
restaurant.  Adelle and Gerald are seated by an enormous bay
window.  A waiter comes to their table with their main
course.  Gerald watches the food being served with great
anticipation.

Gerald's eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on
the sidewalk... He squints to see better.  Realization hits
hard... His eyes light up.  He looks to Adelle and back to
the magazine stand.

In a mad race for time, Gerald begins to devour the food on
his plate.  The waiter and Adelle watch him in shock.  Adelle
glances out the window.  Her eyes squint... then light up.
She jumps to her feet and grabs Gerald by the arm, a fork
full of food drops to his plate.  Gerald looks back at his
full plate longingly as Adelle pulls him out of the
restaurant.

The waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand.  He
squints.

A large PHOTO OF MAURICE is next to the headline.

Maurice flops back to the pillows, completely drained.

The flatlands have vanished.  The roads now serpentine
through mountain ranges.

VIEW FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGE; Maurice moves like a grain of
dust over the black line of the road.

Maurice rests every half mile.  He labors up every incline
with ultimate effort.  He braces himself with a branch
serving as a make due crutch.

Maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the
mountain range.  He begins the journey to rest.

Maurice tentatively moving to the front door.  His hand
instinctively clutches his empty stomach.

The wind blows gently.  Maurice shuts his eyes and takes a
deep breath.  He opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table
being set.  Potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread... floating
through the half open window to Maurice's thankful smile.
THE SOUNDS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS CAN BE HEARD INSIDE.

The first LIGHT KNOCKS go unheard with all the commotion.
HARDER.  The door squeaks open.  Maurice puts on his best
smile... the door opens wider -- no one stands before him.

                    BOY (O.S.)
          Hi.

Maurice looks down to find an adorable little boy, black
hair, big eyes and an even bigger grin.  This is three year
old ISAAC CALDWELL.

                    MAURICE
          Well, hello.

                    ISAAC
          I'm Isaac... I'm three.

                    MAURICE
          I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much
          older than three.  Are your parents
          home?

Beat.  Isaac thinks.

                    ISAAC
          You know what, I can play baseball
          with my brothers when I'm bigger.

                    MAURICE
          Is that right?

                    ISAAC
          You know what... I'm just little
          now, but I'll be big soon.

                    MAURICE
          You'll probably be bigger than your
          brothers.

                    ISAAC
          Yeah!

Isaac is happy with this thought.

Maurice looks up as MRS. CALDWELL comes to the door.

                    MRS. CALDWELL
          Who are you talking to Isaac?

Mrs. Caldwell stops as she stares at Maurice.

                    MAURICE
          Hello, I'm Maurice Parker.  I'm
          just passing through and I need to
          conserve what little funds I
          have... I need some food and a roof
          to sleep under for one night... Now
          I don't look like much, but if
          there are any things that need to
          get done around the house --

Mrs. Caldwell doesn't listen, but instead yells behind the
door.

                    MRS. CALDWELL
          Dave... you're not going to believe
          who's here.

Maurice looks at her oddly.  MR. CALDWELL comes to the door;
his face lights up.

                    MRS. CALDWELL
          This is Maurice Parker -- the one
          walking for his wife.

Mr. Caldwell is completely floored.  So, for that matter is
Maurice.  Mr. Caldwell puts out his hand with awe.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave
          Caldwell.  I do the copy for the
          anchor on the evening news down
          here.

                    MAURICE
          Evening News?

                    MR. CALDWELL
          We did a piece after your story ran
          in the New York Times.

Maurice is truly surprised.

                    MAURICE
          New York Times?

Mrs. Caldwell ushers Maurice in the doorway by the elbow.

                    MRS. CALDWELL
          Someone said they spotted you in

INT.  CALDWELL KITCHEN - NIGHT

The Caldwell family dinner... all twelve of them.  Ten
children talk and reach for food.  Maurice sits at the end
talking, enjoying and sharing.  Isaac sits next to him
proudly.  Maurice has blended in as another member of this
family.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CALDWELL GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

An inviting room.  The kind prepared for visiting
grandmothers and grandfathers to stay in.

Maurice checks himself out in the mirror... his borrowed
pajamas fit nicely.

He moves to the window and stares at the moon lit
landscape... enormous, endless, dwarfing.

The rocking chair CREAKS as Maurice melts into it.  He rubs
his calves slowly, the pain evident in his face.  His head
leans back after a moment... on the verge of sleep.

The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him.  He looks to the
doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his
baseball P.J.s.

                    MAURICE
          I thought you were asleep.

                    ISAAC
          You know what... I remembered you
          were here and I woke up.

Isaac walks silently to Maurice... Tip-toeing all the way.

                    MAURICE
          Your parents would want you to be
          in bed.

                    ISAAC
          You tell stories?

                    MAURICE
          Oh no... I'm not good at that.
          Very bad in fact...

Too late.  Isaac climbs up into Maurice's lap with great
effort.  Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for
him to begin.

                    MAURICE
          I would be exceedingly boring.

Isaac waits.

                    MAURICE
          I don't do these type of things.

Isaac -- still waiting.

                    MAURICE
          See there are two kinds of people
          in this world.
              (beat)
          ... Just a short one okay?

Isaac gets in position, cradled in Maurice's arms.  Maurice
searches for something to say.

                    MAURICE
          There was a boy named Isaac who
          wanted to play baseball, but he was
          too small and no one would let him
          play... but he kept practicing by
          himself -- waiting... He went to
          every game and sat in the stands
          with his glove.

                    ISAAC
          You know what... maybe I ran onto
          the field and hit a home run.

                    MAURICE
          Who's telling this story?

Isaac points to Maurice.

                    MAURICE
          Good, now the team had this great
          big player -- Big Billy.  He was
          the best.  He had them in the World
          Super-Bowl-Championship of little
          kids baseball.  But right before
          the game, the second best player on
          the team was suspended because he
          played a prank on a nice man who
          owned a book store... When that boy
          grew up he was convicted on
          burglary charges and spent fifteen
          years in prison -- where he
          belongs.

Isaac didn't understand that last part.

                    MAURICE
          Anyway, Big Billy needed another
          player so he yelled into the
          stands.  'Who can play baseball?'
          And there was a little voice that
          yelled out, 'Me, I can play.'
          Everyone turned to see a little boy
          standing with a glove.

                    ISAAC
              (beaming)
          That's me.

                    MAURICE
          Right.  But everyone saw how small
          Isaac was and laughed... but not
          Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac
          carefully and then told him to join
          the game.  It came to the end of
          the game.  It was the eleventh or
          twelfth inning or whatever is the
          last inning of a game...

                    ISAAC
          Nine.

                    MAURICE
          Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was
          losing and he was on base.  That's
          when Isaac came up.  He could
          barely hold the bat... Big Billy
          winked at Isaac... The ball was
          pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard.
          It soared up and out over the
          stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac
          hit a home run and won the game.
          After the game, Isaac asked Big
          Billy why he let he play.  Big
          Billy smiled and said, I wasn't
          always Big Billy, I was Little
          Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy
          went off after the game and read a
          classic book together.  The end.

                    ISAAC
          You know what -- that was a really
          good story... Tell it again.

Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously.

                    MAURICE
          There was a boy named Isaac who
          liked to play baseball...

WE BACK OUT as Maurice rocks back and forth in his chair.

EXT.  CALDWELL DRIVEWAY - MORNING

The family dog "Max", scurries up and down with great
excitement.  Max can sense something big is happening.

The Caldwell clan, one and all has gathered at the end of
their driveway.  Maurice is escorted out by Isaac who clings
tightly to his hand.  Mr. Caldwell meets Maurice halfway and
pulls him aside.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          That's a nice watch.

Maurice looks down at his beat-up Seiko.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          I've always wanted a watch like
          that.

                    MAURICE
              (unstrapping it)
          It's yours.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          No.  I won't take it unless I pay
          for it... Let's see, that's a
          pretty nice watch -- I can see
          that.

Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope
from his jacket pocket.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          Let's say I give you what's in this
          envelope for that beautiful watch.

Maurice is handed the envelope.  He opens it to find a thick
PILE OF CASH, TENS AND TWENTIES.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          I really want that watch.

                    MAURICE
          This isn't right.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          This is my only chance to get a
          watch like that.  It would mean a
          lot to me and my family.  Please
          take it.  It really isn't that
          much.

Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over
the watch tentatively.

                    MAURICE
          This is a loan.

Mr. Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice.

The rest of the family say their good-byes.

Isaac won't let go of Maurice's hand as he walks out into the
street.

                    MR. CALDWELL
          Isaac, come back here.

Isaac just holds on tighter.  After Maurice and Isaac have
walked a few steps out into the street, Maurice kneels down.

                    MAURICE
          I have to go now.

Isaac's bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry.  Maurice
has to hold back a few tears himself.  He hugs Isaac tightly.

                    MAURICE
              (whispers)
          Why didn't I meet you fifteen years
          ago?

Maurice pulls away from Isaac slowly.  Isaac runs to his
mother's arms.  Maurice waves good-bye to the Caldwells as he
heads down the road.

half-open door to an OLD MAN who tries to gain his balance by
holding onto the wall.  Maurice is upset.  He runs his
fingers through his hair.

her WEDDING GOWN.  White lace, tight at the arms and waist --
she looks stunning.

                    ELLEN
          What's wrong?  They said something
          was wrong?

Maurice stares at his rented shoes.

                    MAURICE
          I'm fine.

Ellen moves to him and kneels before him.  She lifts his
chin.

                    ELLEN
          Everyone's here.  Everything looks
          beautiful.  They even got the white
          dove I wanted for the cake -- so
          what's wrong?  What is it?

Maurice moves his gaze from her to the half open door.

                    MAURICE
          It's him.

Ellen looks back.

                    ELLEN
          Your father?

                    MAURICE
          He's plastered.

                    ELLEN
          That's okay -- really it is.

                    MAURICE
          No it's not.  He should be here
          with me now, not trying to find
          some fucking bottle of Johnny
          Walker.  He's never been there for
          me.  I've always been alone.

Maurice looks like he may cry.

                    MAURICE
          I'm afraid Ellen... I'm scared of
          being alone again.  What if one day
          you realize how boring I am?  What
          if one day you realize you're not
          happy?
              (beat)
          I could have been alone before, but
          now you've changed things.  I can't
          be alone anymore Ellen.  I'm scared
          what's going to happen to me.

Ellen takes both his hands and squeezes them between hers.

          What?

Michelle is completely flustered as usual.

moving to the wall.  An enormous U.S. MAP covers three
quarters of the wall.  RED TACKS mark a trail across the

Kris notices through the open officer door that Frank and

A merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway.  The
black tar from the road melting slightly.

No sign of Maurice.  WE SEE into the distance, not a soul in
sight.  WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road.
There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an
overhanging rock formation.

Maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on

step with a walking stick.

The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE.  Maurice turns to see a
wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road.
They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust.  Maurice
walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside.

THE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY.  Maurice
looks bad.  He's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep
incline by the side of the road.  His feet slide on the loose
dirt.  Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment.

He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough
room to lay down in the shade.  Maurice lays out slowly.  He
pries off his sneakers, band-aids and blisters cover every
inch of his feet.  Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers
and painfully pulls them back on.  His eyes close as he tries
to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep.

Maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the
hill... First WE SEE nothing, then some grains of sand escape
from the crack where the rock meets the hillside.  The CRACK
BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A
FRACTION OF AN INCH.  It stabilizes there.

Maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty
five feet above the ground.

directly overhead.

Maurice stirs in his sleep, moving closer to the edge of the
rock.

A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK...
A SLIGHT TREMOR...
THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK...

Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off... Hands scraping
at the dirt... He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK... Feet and hands
desperately trying to cling to the hillside... He picks up
speed as he tumbles down... Maurice looks down in time to see
a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him... no time for
panic... SLAM!  A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the
rock square in the ribs... Maurice flops down the rest of the
slope like a rag doll... he comes to rest in the dirt,
clutching his ribs.  The sun beats down on his stunned eyes.

Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope.  Sand still
trickling down to a stop.  He doesn't try to move for the
first few seconds.  His breathing increasingly erratic.

Maurice drags himself to sit upright.  The sharp pains
causing a distorted grimace on his face.  A short rest,
before working his way to his feet.

Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest.  He takes a
seat in the dirt.  Maurice's hair is damp with sweat.  His
breathing relegated to slow gasps.  His left hand covering
his rib cage protectively.  Blood begins to trickle through
the spaces between his fingers.

Maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg
goes into spasms... Maurice is forced to straighten the leg
instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... Maurice clings to
the back of his thigh... Maurice is defeated... On the verge
of tears.

He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE
miles away in the distance.  A car is moving in his
direction.

Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY.  Drops of sweat
falling into his eyes.

                    MAURICE
              (whisper)
          It's over Ellen... I failed you
          again.

Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing
larger.

                    MAURICE
          I tried Ellen, I really tried... I
          don't have the strength.

The cloud is now clearly a car... Maurice stares up into the
sky again... The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks.
Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS.

                    MAURICE
          You said I would never be alone!...
          You promised...
              (his yelling turns to
               sobs)
          ... You promised.

Maurice's is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS
HEAD.  Maurice turns and looks through his tears...

There, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically
on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE.  It stands two and half
feet tall.  It spreads it's great wings.  The feathers expand
like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle
shade on Maurice's face.

Maurice is frozen in wonder.  The MAGIC of the moment glows
in his eyes.  Maurice's face gains life... The dark feathered
eagle stands like a god before Maurice.  The moment is
breathtaking.

                                                  CUT TO:

ROAD

The car on the road, takes the last quarter mile in
seconds... SCREECHING IT'S BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on
the side of the road.

Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up.  The
driver gets out and calls over the hood.

                    DRIVER
          Hey, man are you okay?

Maurice's face filled with strength.  He grins through the
pain.

                    MAURICE
          I'm fine.

                    DRIVER
          What the hell are you doing out
          here?  You need a ride somewhere?

                    MAURICE
          No thank you.

The driver is concerned.  He opens the driver door.

                    DRIVER
          You by yourself?

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          No.

This pacifies the driver somewhat.  He nods and gets in the
car.  Maurice watches as the car pulls away.

He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone.  Maurice
looks up into the sky.  The Golden Eagle is flying
overhead... a tiny dot against the blazing sun.

Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support.
Maurice takes his first step...

EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Suburbia.  Rows of similar houses with small lawns and custom
mailboxes.  Beautiful trees line the streets creating a
canopy over the roadway.

Two women sit on a swing on the front porch of a small
suburban home.  JANIS AND AMMIE'S conversation is cut in mid
sentence.

                    JANIS
          Who is that?

                    AMMIE
          I don't know.  What's the matter
          with him?

Janis and Ammie stare to the street where a sunburnt MAURICE
staggers in a daze.

MAURICE'S POV

Maurice is on the edge of darkness... the trees and faces
swimming -- mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth
waving in the wind... Images come in and out of focus... two
women walking towards him... Maurice clutches his head as the
trees start to swim faster -- color, lights, houses...

                                     DISSOLVING TO BLACK:

Maurice collapses in the middle of this suburban street.
Janis and Ammie run to his side.

SUPERIMPOSED:  "ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA... MILE 3,205"

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Maurice lays still on a hospital bed.  His eyes slowly force
themselves open.

                    NURSE (O.S.)
          Good morning Mr. Parker.

Maurice turns his head to the side.  A pretty woman in her
late twenties, with LARGE LOCKS OF BROWN HAIR smiles back.
This is STEPHANIE.

                    STEPHANIE
          There are a lot of people worried
          about you.

                    MAURICE
              (softly)
          Where am I?

                    STEPHANIE
          In a hospital.

                    MAURICE
          Which hospital?  Did you take me
          back?

Stephanie understands his worry.

                    STEPHANIE
          You are in St. Vincent's Hospital
          in Roseville California.  You've
          been here three days.

Maurice closes his eyes in relief.

                    MAURICE
          Thank God.

INT.  HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

The room is crowded.  Maurice is now propped up in a seated
position.  He tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray.

                    MAURICE
          I can't believe you're here.  I'm
          touched.

Maurice looks across to ADELLE AND GERALD.

                    MAURICE
          Are you two planning kids?

                    ADELLE
          Maybe later.

                    MAURICE
          You should definitely have
          children.  They're really special.

Adelle and Gerald are in shock.  Maurice forks another fish
stick with a smile.

                    ADELLE
          I don't think you realize how
          serious this is Uncle.

                    MAURICE
          How serious is it?

DR. RAY, who has been standing by the window listening, steps
forward.

                    DR. RAY
          You have two broken ribs, a
          punctured spleen and Acute
          Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Maurice gives a comforting smile to Adelle.

                    DR. RAY
          The normal amount of build up in
          your arteries has been aggravated
          by over exertion.  This is called,
          "Claudication,"  As a result, there
          isn't enough circulation to your
          body.  That accounts for the
          discoloration in your extremities
          and the muscle spasms I'm sure
          you've encountered.

                    MAURICE
          Can it kill me?

                    DR. RAY
          It can, but it'll have to wait in
          line.

This surprises Maurice.

                    DR. RAY
          We ran a C.T. and an M.R.I.  We
          found bleeding in your brain.  Your
          collapse was caused by "Transient
          Cerebral-Ischemia"... a sudden loss
          of blood circulation to the brain.
          In other words, Mr. Parker, you had
          a mild stroke.

There is dead silence in the room.

                    MAURICE
              (scared)
          I suppose I over did it.

Adelle moves over to Maurice's side and holds his hand.

                    MAURICE
          What steps do we take now?

                    DR. RAY
          We operate.  We find the artery in
          the brain and close the bleeding...
          I just did this procedure on a
          Senator and he's doing fine.

                    MAURICE
          What are the odds?  Do I have a
          fifty-fifty chance of surviving the
          operation?

                    DR. RAY
          It's hard to say.  It's a delicate
          surgery.  There's no getting around
          the fact that it's a very high-risk
          situation.

Adelle strokes Maurice's hair.  Maurice stares down at his
food before looking up with great resolve.

                    MAURICE
          Then it'll have to wait until I
          finish.

                    ADELLE
          What?

                    MAURICE
          I finish the walk, and then we may
          take all the chances we want.

The room is stunned.  Adelle gets off the bed and collects
herself.

                    ADELLE
          Listen to me very carefully,
          because I don't want you to
          misunderstand me... The walk is
          over Uncle Maurice.  Done.
          Finished.  You've made it to
          California, it was a miracle, now
          let's try to save your life.

                    MAURICE
              (louder)
          I'm completing the walk.  I'm
          almost there.

                    DR. RAY
          Okay, Maurice keep it calm...
              (beat)
          We can talk about this again, but
          just so you know, we have a guard
          on this floor who's sole job it is
          to keep an eye on you.

Maurice is crushed.

                    DR. RAY
          There are a lot of people out there
          who would like to see you finish,
          including me, but I'm not willing
          to put your life in anymore risk
          than it is... We do the operation,
          and when you're better, you finish
          the walk.

The room is dead again.  Maurice drowns in his thoughts.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  HOSPITAL CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

A small chapel.  Stain glass windows overlooking the parking
lot.  Maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of the
room.  A few other patients are scattered in the four small
pews.

Maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at the
statue of Mary.  His concentration is broken as a man in a
full black suit and black shirt sits next to him.  Maurice
nods at the priest.

                    PRIEST
          Hello, Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE
          Hello.

                    PRIEST
          How are you feeling?

                    MAURICE
          Confused.  I'm not sure what to do
          now.  I'm not sure what he wants
          for me.

                    PRIEST
          He wants to reward you... That's
          why I'm here.

                    MAURICE
              (a little confused)
          What do you mean?

                    PRIEST
          I mean you've done a great thing.
          You should be rewarded monetarily.

Maurice is lost.

                    PRIEST
          What's your shoe size?

                    MAURICE
          What?  Who are you?

The priest reaches into his jacket -- for the first time WE
SEE a Polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain around
his neck.

                    PRIEST
          Clive Silver -- Marketing Executive
          at Reebok.

Maurice stares at the card in disbelief.

                    CLIVE
          We want you to do some spots for
          us.

                    MAURICE
          What the hell is this?

Some of the patients turn around.

                    CLIVE
          I'm talking six figures, pay or
          play -- for two spots.  We want to
          push a new line with you...
          America's New Hero.

Maurice is flustered.  He can't take this.  His eyes become
desperate.

Clive waves his hands in the air excitedly.

                    CLIVE
          Imagine grainy black and white
          shots of long stretches of highway
          -- quick cuts with a slow pounding
          beat underneath... Then we see a
          man walking up a steep incline --
          it's you Maurice.  We see shots of
          you walking.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.
          Fast... Music crescendoes -- Bham!
          Close up -- and you say...
          'Reebok, Because There's Nothing
          You Can't Do.'

Clive finishes.  He is surprised to find Maurice in tears.
Clive is thrown totally off as Maurice stares at him angrily
through streaming tears.

                    MAURICE
          My wife is dead.

Maurice continues his powerful gaze until Clive looks away.
Clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without
another word.  Maurice drops his head into his hands and
cries quietly.

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

A change of shifts.  Stephanie gathers her things.  She lifts
her coat off the counter.  Underneath is a paper.  She spins
the paper to face her.  The headline reads, "The End of a
Journey - Parker Hospitalized."

          Good night Mr. Parker.  I'll see
          you tomorrow.

Stephanie waits for a response from the motionless figure on
the bed.  She leaves the room a little disappointed.

WE MOVE CLOSER TO THE BED.  We see Maurice laying still --
the battered photo of Ellen clutches to his chest.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALL - DAY

Stephanie is wheeling Maurice down the hall.  Maurice has a
glint of happiness in his eye.  They move through the doors
marked "Visitor's Area."

Maurice stretches a huge grin as KRIS REDDY gets up from a
chair.  Kris bends down and hugs Maurice emotionally.

                    KRIS
          Tom Joad?

                    MAURICE
          ... The Grapes of Wrath.

                    KRIS
          You're amazing.

LATER

Maurice and Kris seated in the corner of the room.

                    MAURICE
          I missed you Kris.

                    KRIS
          I missed you to Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE
          Adelle told me, your writing is
          going well.  The Crusader for
          social issues and all.

                    KRIS
          You were right.  From the heart is
          always better.

Beat.

                    KRIS
          I drove by the bookstore -- it's
          boarded up now.  There's a sign
          over the wood -- "Office space
          available."

The loss is evident on Maurice's eyes.

                    MAURICE
          I haven't been too punctual with
          the rent.

                    KRIS
          I was thinking you could open
          another store with investors.  I'm
          sure a lot of people would want to
          get involved with you now.

Maurice forces a smile.

                    MAURICE
          Actually, I'm not worried about my
          career right now... I'm more
          worried about how you're getting me
          out of here?

Beat.  Kris glances at the hair on his forearm.

                    MAURICE
          Are they standing?

                    KRIS
              (running his hand over his
               arm)
          Saluting.

Beat.

                    KRIS
          Come on Mr. Parker.

                    MAURICE
          What, come on?

                    KRIS
          I can't do it.  I want you to
          finish, but I want you to live
          more.

Maurice sits back straight.  He looks upset.

                    MAURICE
          We do the operation after I finish.
          I can't risk not finishing... I
          thought you understood what I was
          doing.

                    KRIS
          I do.

                    MAURICE
          Why in God's name did you fly all
          the way here then?

                    KRIS
          Don't do this.

                    MAURICE
          ... To look me in the eye and say
          what's important to you isn't as
          important to me?  To tell me you
          know what's best?  To tell me life
          is more precious than what I feel
          for my wife?

Kris gets very emotional.  He rises from this chair.

                    KRIS
          Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if
          it'll help.  But I'm not risking
          your life.

                    MAURICE
          It's mine to risk.

Maurice turns to the window away from Kris.

                    KRIS
          Your operation is scheduled for
          Friday.  I'll be back before then.

Kris walks to the door and stops.

                    KRIS
          She knows you love her Mr. Parker.
          She knows now.

                    MAURICE
              (not looking at Kris)
          No more words.  Until I touch the
          ocean with my hands... it's all
          just words.

Kris is tortured.  He leaves the room.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALL - DAY

Maurice wheels himself into the hall from the waiting area.
He looks around.  His eyes lock on the EXIT SIGN over the
door at the end of the hall.  His eyes scan the area quickly.
He immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him.
The guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, "I know what
you're thinking."  Maurice turns his attention to a small boy
in a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse.

                    HEAD NURSE
          You cooperate with us about taking
          your medicine and maybe we'll talk
          about candy.

The head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tiny
hands.  The boy offers no response.  Maurice watches
curiously as STEPHANIE walks over and pats the boys head.
Maurice catches a small exchange -- Stephanie slips another
candy bar into his pocket.  The boy breaks into a warm smile.
Stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks.
Maurice takes this exchange in with great interest.

INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Stephanie steps into the room and prepares a tray of food.
The SILHOUETTED FIGURE of Maurice seated near the bay window
turns to face her.

                    STEPHANIE
          You should be in bed.

The face stares back from the shadows.  She feels him
watching.

                    MAURICE
          What do your friends call you?

                    STEPHANIE
          Steph.

                    MAURICE
          Do you have a car, Steph?

Beat.

                    STEPHANIE
          You should be in bed...

Stephanie moves to Maurice... She stops short when his face
comes into view.  His eyes are raw -- red.  His face puffy.

                    STEPHANIE
          You're in pain.

                    MAURICE
          I need your help.

                    STEPHANIE
          They told me, you might try to talk
          me into something... You need to
          rest Mr. Parker... It's for your
          own good.
              (beat)
          I've been following your story for
          a long while.  It's a beautiful
          thing you did.

                    MAURICE
          You ever lose somebody Stephanie?

                    STEPHANIE
          Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give
          you your fish sticks.

Beat.  Maurice melts her with his expression.

                    STEPHANIE
          ... My father.

                    MAURICE
          Did you tell him everything you
          wanted to?  Did you do everything
          you could while he was here?

She shakes her head "No" -- the tears welling up in her eyes.

                    MAURICE
          If I don't do this Steph, my life
          isn't worth saving.

Maurice reaches out and squeezes her soft trembling hand.

                    MAURICE
          Please, help me.

INT.  HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

Stephanie throws a nervous smile to the guard as she escorts
a doctor down the hall... The doctor's oversized while lab
coat almost drags on the floor as he tries to hide the pain
of being on his feet.  MAURICE PARKER studies a bogus chart
in his hands.  His new glasses, sliding off his nose.  Beads
of sweat -- revealing his agony.

                                                  CUT TO:

ELEVATOR

Three people in the elevator; Stephanie, Dr. Maurice Parker,
and a female physician.  The female doctor looks at Maurice
curiously, studying his demeanor -- she can't place him.

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN on the third floor... The SOUND OF A
TV FLOODS THE ELEVATOR COMPARTMENT.  Maurice looks up in
horror to see a close-up of his FACE superimposed on the TV
screen seated on the receptionist's desk.  A man gets on the
elevator.

The female doctor stares at the TV as the doors close -- she
immediately turns to Maurice... her view is blocked by the
new passenger... the elevator progresses down 2... 1...
The female doctor leans forward trying to get a glimpse of
Maurice... THE BELL DINGS as the doors open on the ground
floor.

Doctor Maurice Parker and Stephanie quickly exit... the
female doctor stays in the elevator and watches carefully.

                    FEMALE DOCTOR
              (yells)
          Excuse me, doctor...

DOWN THE HALL... Maurice pauses and turns around -- fear
etched across his face.  The female doctor looks around the
barren hall then turns back to Maurice.

                    FEMALE DOCTOR
          Good luck.

The female doctor smiles as the doors shut.  After a few
moments of shock -- Maurice smiles back.

Stephanie yanks Maurice down the hall and out the EMERGENCY
ROOM EXIT.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

A colorful canopy of leaves... a familiar torn American flag.
Stephanie's white VW Rabbit pulls to a stop.

                    MAURICE
          This is it... This is where I fell.

He turns back to Stephanie who stares back at him
emotionally.

                    STEPHANIE
          I never thanked my father.  He did
          so much for me... I never thanked
          him.

Maurice holds her sad face in his scared hands.

                    MAURICE
              (whispering)
          It's not too late.

Maurice gets out of the car painfully slow.  He pulls his
shoulder back upright with a laborious breath.  A sense of
pride returns to his face.  He turns back to Stephanie and
catches a horrified look.  He follows her stare...

She is staring at his shirt... He looks down to see a DARK
CRIMSON STAIN GROWING beneath the surface.  He covers the
area with his hand.

                    MAURICE
          You're going to have a lot of work
          to do when I get back.

                    STEPHANIE
          Someone should be with you.

Beat.

                    MAURICE
          Someone is.

He gives her his best smile and begins shuffling his feet
over the loose gravel of the road... one step at a time.

INT.  HOSPITAL STAIRS - AFTERNOON

A black man -- grey, balding hair walks hurriedly up the
stairs.  This is STAN NEWTON.

Keeping in step with Newton is a police officer.  SERGEANT
EMORY, jet white hair, army cut, gives him an intimidating
appearance.

Newton stops Emory before entering.

                    NEWTON
          I'm afraid Mrs. Matlin is very
          upset.

Emory lets the warning sink in before opening the door.
Adelle's VOICE IS BOOMING.

HOSPITAL ROOM

Adelle YELLS at Dr. Ray, a few nurses, and the guard who was
on duty.

                    ADELLE
          ... "American Journal of
          Psychology", "Psychological
          Review", and "Science", so I think
          it's safe to say my opinion is
          valid.

She catches her breath.

                    ADELLE
          How does a grown man who can barely
          walk, just stroll out?... This is
          not James Bond here, this is my
          uncle who owns a bookstore, and
          gets outwitted by grade school kids
          pulling pranks!

Adelle notices the new people in the room.

                    NEWTON
          Mrs. Matlin, this is Sergeant
          Emory.  He'll help us find your
          uncle.

Adelle walks up to Emory.

                    ADELLE
          Let me tell you a story Sergeant.
          There was a patient of mine who had
          a Golden Retriever, Mac... She
          loved Mac, not like a pet, but like
          a family member.  One day, she had
          to leave Mac with 'friends', and
          wouldn't you know it, Mac gets away
          and ends up falling into a sewer.
          My patient comes back -- goes nuts
          when she hears that Mac has been in
          the sewer for over 48 hours.
          Apparently the cop who found the
          dog didn't want to get his pants
          dirty.  And neither did anyone
          else.  So of course, my patient
          decides to go in after it... she
          falls... breaks her hip and lands
          next to her dead dog, who died of
          toxic fumes down there...

Adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces.

                    ADELLE
          The moral of the story is... She
          sued for a lot of money!  She sued
          the friends, the city, and the
          officer for negligence on duty.
          She has no Mac, no happiness, but
          she's very rich now... That was a
          dog.  We're talking about a human
          being...
              (beat)
          I hope everyone clearly understands
          the chain of events that will occur
          if something should happen to my
          uncle, whom I love more than you
          can possibly imagine... Now
          Sergeant I would like to know right
          now, if you're willing to get your
          pants dirty for my uncle?

Adelle and Emory have a staring contest.  Adelle wins.
Adelle stands alone in a room with four men, and she is
clearly the one in charge.

The door flies open.  A police officer walks in pushing KRIS
REDDY through the door.

                    OFFICER
          I found him sneaking up the back
          stairs with this.

The officer holds out a long coat and hat.  Emory walks up to
Kris.

                    EMORY
          Did you help Mr. Parker leave this
          hospital?

Kris looks to the empty bed and smiles... a BIG SMILE.

                    KRIS
          No... But I was going to.

Beat.  Emory turns to the officer and ushers him to the door.

                    EMORY
          Forget him.  It's time to get our
          pants dirty.

Adelle smiles.

                    EMORY
          I want three black and whites from
          here to Handley Avenue.  And no
          communication with the station.
          The press monitors the
          transmissions.

                    KRIS
              (a born actor)
          They can do that?

                    EMORY
          That goes for all of you.  Not a
          word about this disappearance to
          anyone.  Absolutely no press.

Kris smiles innocently.

A COMMOTION BREAKS OUT ONE BLOCK DOWN... Kris spins in that
direction... sees a crowd forming at the corner of the
sidewalk... Starts toward them... Kris sees something through
the thinner parts of the crowd... something laying on the
sidewalk... A man!  Kris' walk turns into a sprint.

Kris works his way through the growing crowd, puncturing the
center of the circle... Kris gazes down at the man writhing
on the concrete... A black man, shaking uncontrollably.  A
women standing over the fallen man waves the crowd back.

                    WOMAN
          He has Epilepsy, just give him
          room... An ambulance is on the way.

The crowd spreads out.  Kris looks down at the unconscious
man on the sidewalk sadly -- Kris' thoughts race.  He moves

A converted gymnasium.  The room is splintered into rows of
folding tables and chairs.  Against the wall, is the serving
stand.  Groups of volunteers dispense sandwiches and soup.

IN THE CORNER

The room is crowded with homeless men and women and a few
children.  In the back we find MAURICE.  In his old clothes,
and tired disheveled appearance -- Maurice is virtually
invisible in this crowd.  He presses something to his injured
side.  His condition has worsened.

He eyes the entrance where a POLICE OFFICER walks in and
moves to the serving counter.  The officer asks the serving
lady something, and shows her a picture.  She shrugs her
shoulders and continues serving.  The cop takes one last look
around the hundreds of hungry people leaving the room.

Maurice pulls up his hand from underneath his shirt.  The
napkin he was holding at his side is SATURATED WITH BLOOD.
Maurice replaces it with a clean napkin.

          San Francisco Chronicle -- 'Have
          You Seen Maurice?'... New York Post
          'Unstoppable!'

Klein lays the last paper on the table.

                    EMORY
          Is that all?

                    KLEIN
          No.  The Mayor sent word, that he
          wants this thing handled quickly,
          before anything unfortunate
          happens.  He said he doesn't want
          to be known as the 'Mayor of the
          City Where Maurice Parker Died!'

                    EMORY
          Is that all?

                    KLEIN
          No.  Mrs. Matlin's waiting for
          you.

Klein opens the door.  Adelle walks in and stands at a
distance from Emory.  She looks beat.  Her eyes are
bloodshot, and tired.

                    ADELLE
          What happened with the museum
          sighting?

                    EMORY
          False alarm.

Adelle is visibly dejected.

                    EMORY
          It's been a long couple of days for
          all of us.  So let me be honest.
          If he hasn't turned up yet, he's
          probably --

                    ADELLE
          No... No.

                    EMORY
          I spoke with Dr. Ray this morning,
          and he said it was highly unlikely
          that someone in his condition could
          survive this long without medical
          attention, let alone walk sixty
          miles -- in fact his exact word
          was, 'Impossible'.

Adelle fiddles with her coat.

                    EMORY
          If I knew where he was, I'd get him
          off the street, but I think it's
          time that you, the Mayor, and
          everyone else be braced for the
          inevitable.

The freeway is packed -- bumper to bumper.  Cars standing
still in the hot sun.

A hispanic man in his late forties, JUAN is seated in his
Dodge Caravan when he sees someone in his rearview mirror.  A
man is using a stick as a cane.  The struggling man makes his
way along the shoulder very slowly.

Juan reaches over to his passenger seat and turns over the
L.A. Times.  Under the heading, "He's Back!" is Maurice's
picture.  Juan quickly rolls down his window as Maurice
passes by on the shoulder.

              (yelling)
          Hey, Maurice man -- keep going
          buddy!

Maurice is startled at the man's yell, but then smiles when
the words register.  Maurice struggles forward.

Juan keeps yelling encouragements... This grabs the attention
of other drivers who realize who is walking past them.  One
by one, car doors open and people call to Maurice.

Cars start to HONK... More and more people turn to see the
commotion... The YELLING AND HONKING IS JOINED BY WHISTLES
AND CHEERS --

Maurice can't believe it -- he tries to smile but can't hold
it.  His face tightens with every step.  His shirt is soiled
with blood.  He raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a
woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the
car.

listening to the radio conversation.

          What's going on?  Where is he?

Emory CLICKS TO LISTEN.  THE SPEAKERS EXPLODE WITH HONKING
AND CHEERING -- IT SOUNDS LIKE A CARNIVAL.  DAWSON YELLS OVER
THE COMMOTION.

                    DAWSON (V.O.)
          He's just getting off 280.  It's
          amazing Sarg... everybody's out of
          their cars and cheering him on.

                    EMORY
          Shit, get him in your car and take
          him to St. Vincents.

Beat.

                    DAWSON (V.O.)
          You ever see that concert footage
          of the Doors, Sarg?

Adelle and the room of officers look confused.

                    EMORY
          What the hell are you talking
          about?

                    DAWSON (V.O.)
          The Doors, the musical group.  I
          saw a documentary where the police
          stopped one of their concerts,
          snatched Jim Morrison right off the
          stage... the crowd went frickin
          nuts -- they tore up the place --
          it turned into a war.
              (beat)
          ... I'm not stopping this concert
          by myself.  And there's no way
          you're getting backup here -- it's
          jammed up for miles.

Emory is thinking fast.

                    DAWSON (V.O.)
          Why don't we just let him finish
          Sarg?

Beat.  Emory looks at Adelle's expectant face.  He talks into
the C.B. without taking his eyes off her.

                    EMORY
          How does he look?

                    DAWSON (V.O.)
          Like shit.  He's bleeding heavily.
          He's having breathing problems and
          he's as pale as stone.  If he
          wasn't moving, I'd swear he was
          dead.

Emory thinks.  He talks to the other officers in the room.

                    EMORY
          Bring him in.  Now!  If he dies out
          there, who the hell knows what that

          Let alone the Mayor.

The room empties fast.  Emory talks to Adelle.

                    EMORY
          He'll be in a hospital within a
          half an hour.

Somehow, Adelle's face doesn't convey much confidence.

INT.  PACIFICA MALL - DAY

The shops are empty.  The food court abandoned.

Close to five hundred people are huddled at the center of the
mall.  The HI-FI HOUSE has four large screen TV's in their
bay windows and speakers on the outside of the doors to lure
passing shoppers in.

All four sets have the same program on -- A NEWSBREAK on
Maurice Parker.  The crowd listening anxiously.

                    TV ANCHOR
          ... He's headed West on Sharp Park
          Road... Witnesses describe him as
          seriously injured.

A shock of concern shoots through the crowd.

                    TV ANCHOR
          Lynn McCay and our Highway Cam --
          has just spotted him...

The picture cuts to a HELICOPTER SHOT OF DOWNTOWN PACIFICA --
at first it just looks like an aerial of buildings, then the
camera ZOOMS.  It catches a tiny figure struggling through a
street intersection.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Newspapers spiral through the air.  Maurice stretches his
neck up, squinting at the sun.  The SILHOUETTE OF A
HELICOPTER hovers above him.  The NOISE is overpowering.

Maurice's fatigue grows, every muscle, every ounce of energy
goes into each step.  Maurice clutches the side of his
head... the steps halted... hands trembling, teeth clenched,
eyes squeezed shut.  A surge of intense pain tries to buckle
him... Maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again.

The helicopter SWOOPS above as he makes his turn onto a FINAL
STRETCH OF ROAD adjacent to the BEACH.

Maurice stops dead in his tracks as he turns the corner to
find a SEA OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR HIM.  A momentous sight...
people lined along the street for as far as the eye can see.
AN EXPLOSION OF YELLING, CHEERING CALIFORNIAN'S ENGULFS THE
AIR as they spot Maurice standing at the end of the street.
The CROWD SURGES TOWARDS HIM.

Maurice is dazed... the noise, the pain, the faces swirl in
his head as thousands of people surround him.  Maurice is
overwhelmed.  He is about to collapse when someone takes hold
of his arm.  Maurice turns to see KRIS REDDY STANDING NEXT TO
HIM.  In the midst of this chaos and growing madness.
Maurice and Kris have an entire conversation with one
emotional look.

The SOUNDS of SIRENS BREAK the moment.  Kris turns to see two
police cars turn on the street behind them.

Kris turns to Maurice.

                    KRIS
          Don't stop walking.

Kris lets go of his arm and moves like lightning.  He jumps
atop a fire-hydrant and yells to the crowd.

                    KRIS
          The police are here.  They're
          coming to take Mr. Parker away.  He
          needs our help.

Kris points to the squad cars inching their way up the
street.

                    KRIS
          Help Mr. Parker!  Don't let them
          end the walk.

                    SPEAKER
          Step aside now!  You are ordered to
          step aside now!

The people don't move.  A WOMAN carrying a BABY makes the
baby move her little hand in a waving gesture to the officers
behind the wheel of the police cars.  The officers look at
each other in disbelief.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

The far end of the beach road.  A POLICE CAR SCREECHES TO A
STOP.  Sergeant Emory and Adelle get out.

Adelle is completely blown away.  She looks around at the
PANDEMONIUM.  Thousands of men, women and children
celebrating with APPLAUSE AND CHEERS, HELICOPTERS IN THE AIR,
camera crews standing on raised platforms.  Adelle drinks in
the ELECTRIC ATMOSPHERE with awe.

Emory yells orders into his WALKIE-TALKIE as Adelle breaks
the outer edge of the crowd and disappears into the field of
spectators.

                    EMORY
              (yelling)
          What the hell is going on?  It's

          mucho backup -- now!... Officers
          are to bring in Mr. Parker on

          hesitate, bring him in... I want a
          barricade placed along the entire
          beach area... Now God damn it, now!

Emory CLICKS OFF and looks around at the growing crowd -- he
turns to see a PUBLIC BUS UNLOADING PASSENGERS -- fifty more
spectators rush off the bus and rush toward the crowded
street.

                    EMORY
          Holy shit.

Maurice stares down at the ground... willing each new step.
THE CHEERS AND WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT BLURRING INTO A
UNDISTINGUISHABLE SOUND.

Maurice looks up for a moment as something grabs his
attention -- Maurice gasps for air as his eyes focus... The
small faces become clearer... Maurice stands twenty feet from
the entire population of PACIFICA HIGH SCHOOL.  They cover
one side of the street for an entire block.  Stretched over
their heads, held up by twenty students is a HUGE HAND
PAINTED BANNER.  Maurice reads the words:

                    "ELLEN IS WATCHING!"

The BOISTEROUS crowd parts like a ripple effect as Maurice
walks through.  The eyes fall emotionally on him as he stares
down at the ground trying to keep moving.

Maurice gasps harder now, his eyes stinging with drops of
sweat falling from his brow.  People in the crowd cover their
mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him... His shirt
soaked on one side with blood, his entire body shaking with
pain, and exhaustion, his face hollow and pale -- ghostly.

Maurice stops in his tracks.  He looks up at a wooden sign,
worn from the years of salt water air.  The sign reads:

                "PACIFICA BEACH - 1/2 MILE"

Maurice's thoughts fade away from this place, this time...

arms.  She is awake and watching the shadows dance on the
ceiling.  She speaks in whispers.

                    ELLEN
          What do you think heaven is like?

Maurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife.

                    MAURICE
          I don't know.

                    ELLEN
          I think it's a different place for
          each person.

                    MAURICE
          Did you have a dream?

Beat.

Maurice chuckles.

                    MAURICE
          Why there?

                    ELLEN
          When I was ten, my family lived in
          Pacifica for a year.  I used to go
          to the beach everyday that summer.
          I never felt so happy, carefree.
          It was a magic place for me...
          That's where my heaven will be.

          look now?

Maurice snaps back to the present, the PAIN AND COMMOTION
come back in a tidal wave of reality.

Maurice wipes the tears in his eyes and tries to take a step.
Someone blocks his way.

                    ADELLE
          Uncle Maurice, please, we have to
          get you to a hospital.

Adelle looks at her wounded Uncle sadly.  She touches his
shirt and her hand comes away with blood.

                    MAURICE
          I have to finish first.

                    ADELLE
          I won't let you die.

The inner circle of people bursts open, as KRIS BREAKS
THROUGH.

                    KRIS
          Let him finish Adelle.  He's almost
          there.

                    ADELLE
              (yelling)
          He's almost dead.  Can't you see
          that!  This has nothing to do with
          you.

Maurice touches Adelle's cheek turning her attention back to
him.  He barely manages to get the words out.

                    MAURICE
          It has nothing to do with you
          either... This is between Ellen and
          me.

Beat.  Maurice begins crying uncontrollably.

                    MAURICE
          I'm begging you...

Maurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to
her hand as if getting blessings from her.

                    MAURICE
          Let me do this for Ellen, let me do
          this for my wife.

Adelle's heart is breaking.  She weeps openly as she
straightens her Uncle to an upright position.  She wipes the
tears from his eyes with her hand gently.

AT THAT MOMENT THE INNER CIRCLE BREAKS OPEN AS TWO OFFICERS
RUSH IN.  They reach for Maurice.

                    ADELLE
          Touch him, and they'll be a riot...

Adelle stands firm, the strength in her growing with each
second.

                    ADELLE
          ... and I'll start it.

The officers are taken off guard.  They look around at the
countless sea of eyes on them.  Adelle sees they won't do
anything and moves to Maurice's side.

Maurice begins to walk again.  Adelle to one side, Kris to
the other and thousands of people following in step.

clicking off his walkie-talkie as the crowd presses up to the
barricade.  Officer Gantz is in awe as Maurice appears from
the crowd -- looking like a ghost of war... a holy
apparition.  Maurice works his way painfully to Gantz.

Gantz looks into Maurice's pleading eyes.  Maurice tries to
say something, but nothing can come out...

Gantz turns away from Maurice and picks up one of the
barricades.  He makes an opening about three feet wide.
Gantz turns back to Maurice, stands at attention, and steps
aside.

                    GANTZ
              (with unspeakable
               admiration)

Adelle and Kris watch in amazement as Maurice TAKES HIS FIRST
STEP ONTO THE SAND.

An empty beach.  ALL SOUND AND CHAOS DISAPPEARS.  THE GENTLE
HISS OF THE OCEAN FILLS THE AIR.

The last fifty yards...

The steps in the sand, heavy, torturous.  Each step, a step
closer to her...

Maurice picks up the pace.  His numb feet making prints in
the sand.  His lungs on fire...

Twenty feet left... Ten... Five...

The COOL WATER engulfs his feet and ankles.  Maurice falls to
his knees like a man falling before God.

Kneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.
The water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.

Maurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.  The water
comes in and washes over him... Gasping harder... He's
staring into the sky... Another wave of ocean gently blankets
him... Gasp... He spots something above him, fluttering...
his vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION.  THE
IMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a
WHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM...

Maurice takes a short breath, very short.  His body goes
still -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no
more loss, no more words...

The water washes over Maurice A. Parker...
Over his lifeless body...
And over his smile...

          Larry controlling the aisles like an Admiral at a Battle
          Map... stacking a mountain of tube socks... stocking those
          briefs ... hanging "Metallica" Speedos on little hangers...
          helping CUBBY - a very skinny and disinterested Janitor -
          clean up some baby up-chuck as the baby up-chucks again.

          Larry is collecting loose shopping carts, steering them into
          pairs, triplets, sextuplets, then riding them into the cart
          pen like a Trail Boss...

                         LATER

                         
          That same up-chucking baby was riding on the coin-pony and up-
          chucked again. Larry is cleaning it all up.
          A beat-up CAR with a BIG STORK PIZZA sign stuck on its roof
          pulls right up to the front of the store, parking in the
          Handicapped Space.

          INT. MEETING ROOM 2 - UNIMART - LATER

          The BIG STORK PIZZA BOXES have been raided for slices.

                         
          A RETIREMENT PARTY is going on. A SIGN reads "Good Luck
          Dorothy Genkos!" The name has been printed over the last
          person to retire. People are cutting loose as best they can
          at a NO-ALCOHOL Corporate Fete.
          None more than Larry. Who is organizing a MOSH PIT for
          DOROTHY GENKOS, an old lady. This is a fun group.
          Over in the corner, though, is the Front Office Staff: COX,
          STRANG, ANDREWS and HURLEY (Female).

           4.

                         

                         

                          STRANG
           Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two-
           K a year are history. Who else
           would do us that favor?

                          ANDREWS
           Wish they'd all sail off like her.
           Save us some grief.

                          STRANG
           The "R" Bomb is going to do some
           collateral damage to this place.
          Hurley is shocked!

                          HURLEY
           "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?

                          COX
           Separating the chaff from the
           wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff,
           right?

                          HURLEY

                         

                         

                         

                         
           Chaff is the waste matter, correct.

                         
           When are we restructuring?

                          COX
           Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders.
          Hurley looks sick. She hates this.

                          STRANG
           What say we drop a brick in the
           pond to warn the herd?

                          ANDREWS
           How?

                          STRANG
           Firing someone.

                          COX
           Someone they'd never expect to be
           let go. To look fair. I like it.

                          STRANG
           Like a Team Leader.

                          HURLEY
           Team Leader?

           Suggestions on who it should be?

                          STRANG
           I say Crowne.

                          HURLEY
           Larry Crowne?
          Strang rolls his eyes.

                         

                          STRANG
           Who else? Avery won't retire. We
           fire him, it's a law suit.
          AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.

           What Salary Tier is Crowne at?

                          ANDREWS
           Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L.
           bump at the first of the year.

                          COX
           Sweet. We'll need Actionable
           Cause, of course.
          They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."

                         

                          COX (CONT'D)
           How's his review record?

                          HURLEY
           He's a candidate for Employee of
           the Month. His 22nd time.

                          COX
           Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a
           reason...
          Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.

           6.

           Larry will always be passed over
           for Management. He never went to

                          COX
           You're that familiar with his
           record?

                          STRANG
           She was his squeeze for a few
           weeks, weren't you, Vick?

                          HURLEY
           That was before the New Employee

           remember...

                          STRANG

          Larry is the only Team Leader still on duty and sober. He is
          fastidious in his work.
          The P.A. System blares. It's incomprehensible. He pays no
          attention. VASQUEZ -- a HUGE Security Guard -- comes by.

          Larry Cr wne soars into the room. Cubby is cleaning up the
          substantial mess. The Front Office Team has taken seats.

           alone in this room, and look at us
           now.
          Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.

           Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So
           we take care. Which makes moments
           like these tough for all of us.

          Larry is joking.

           Corporate has mandated a
           restructuring in all UniMart
           stores. That's the word they use.
           I call it a pain in the touchas.

           Yeah. A yiddish word.

                          ANDREWS
           Like the buttocks.

                          HURLEY
           Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.

                          COX
           Hurts to get kicked back there, no
           matter what language you speak.

          Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.

                         

                          HURLEY
           Seniority would preclude this
           reality, Larry, but UniMart's
           policy is to never limit your
           horizons.
          Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.

          Then, we hear the engines of SCOOTERS -- at least a dozen of
          them. They surround his car -- both lanes -- and the chatter
          of the riders as they scream over their engines as they AD-
          "Remember, you always have a friend

           This?

           No. There should be another box.

           I used to work for UniMart! I
           could spill you some 411.

           MR. PATTERSON

           I know their trade secrets.

           MR. PATTERSON
           What secrets? Traffic boosters,
           loss leaders and bait and switch!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           And I'm ready to learn new
           strategies. I'll stop by again so
           you can keep me in mind.

           MR. PATTERSON
           If you won't work Sundays, don't
           bother.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'll work every day.

           MR. PATTERSON
           That's what I already do...

          Larry sits in his car. The last thing he wants to do is work
          in a restaurant -- we'll find out why later on. But times
          are tough, no?
          Out he climbs, resigned to fate...

          INT. RESTAURANT #2 - WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR - DAY

          Now he's asking some HEAD COOK pulling cutlets.

           As I recall, I gave my notice and
           worked all my shifts and that was
           12 years ago.

                          CHEF AMOS
           As I recall, I had to hire and
           train a line cook to take your
           place. Walking out doesn't happen
           in a vacuum, you know.

                          (THEN)
           Doesn't mean I wouldn't give you a
           job again. But you've been out of
           the business a long time, and look
           around. I don't need you.
          The place is fully staffed and rocking. Larry will not be
          working here.

          Larry is seated at the counter. PERRY pours him coffee as
          RAUL -- the head cook -- is talking from the service window.
          CARLOS and NICK are in the back.

                         

                          RAUL
           You come in two weeks ago I would
           have kissed you on the mouth, but
           Carlos and Nick, they walked in.
           Best I can do? Put you at the top
           of the list.
          Raul goes back to work.

                         

                          PERRY
           Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I

           Like what?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Nothing. I was just saying that.

          The door open, the garage very tidy, as Larry moves old items

          Lamarr is about to pour himself some coffee when he sees a

          Lamarr comes charging out the rising door and across the

                          LAMARR
           There's been a yard sale at 1402

          He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him.

          EXT. E.C.C.C. - PORTABLE CLASSROOMS

          STUDENTS search for their new classrooms. Mercedes does too,
          among these 'portable' classrooms that have not moved in 7
          years.

          Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates
          Larry Crowne.
          She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in
          large, shaky-yet-feminine script:

          CARE.

                         
          She underlines it four times.

          An actual classroom, but in sad shape. In one section sits

          Larry sees her and sits next to her, oblivious to the fact
          that she is cripplingly shy.

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - DEN - EVENING

          DEAN TAINOT is a self-published author and blogger -- with a
          taste for this kind of stuff. Multiple copies of his own
          books line the shelves.
          When he hears the FRONT DOOR open -- he panics.

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Well, hey! Who's home early!
          He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe.
          Mercedes calls from the other room.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           32.

                         

                         
          He covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk.

                         KITCHEN

                         
          Mercedes is prepping the Margaritas for cocktail hour.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           First day of term calls for a
           celebration!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You'd think so.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           What's your burden this go round?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water
           Torture. And Speech at Sunrise

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I built a Flamethrower of a posting
           for WarriorWeb which, if I do say,
           will feed nicely as an outline for

                         

                         
          As the blender BLARES, husband and wife eye each other. She's
          looking at him. He's smiling like a guilty idiot.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           "Carrier: Second Angel." And, I

                         
           was a guest blogger on CyberShare.

                         

                         

                         
          Blender off. She starts pouring.

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Y u don't believe me.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Why wouldn't I believe you?

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I was composing, Mercy. That's
           what I do all day.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You were looking at porn.
          She takes a nice pull on that icy drink.
          Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw
          some erotica. I'm a man, I admit
          it.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
          Took you a while.

           33.

                         

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           It's barely porn. I'm not hiding
           it.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yes you are.
          She bangs her head.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Brain freeze.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Don't chug. Sip.

                          (THEN)
           Everyone hides something.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I have no secrets from you. I
           share the whole miserable slate.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You walked in the door pissed off
           because -- I'm sorry -- I've

                         

                         

                         

                         
           established a beach head in New

                         
           Media while you still have to teach
           at Vassar of the Valley. You hide
           that.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                          (SERIOUS EYES)
           You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X
           expecting me to pretend I don't
           know or I don't care. I do both
           and don't like it.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           It may look like I don't work hard
           around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm
           just a guy who's a guy being a guy
           when you're not around...
          She walks away.

                         

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           And walking away is great for a
           relationship...

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - PATIO - SAME

          It's a tiny slab, but there is a tree and a fence and a

           34.

                         

                         
          Mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her
          chair and into her drink. This is where she goes when she
          thinks/drinks.
          Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last
          point.

                          DEAN TAINOT

                          (THROUGH GLASS)
           I'm a guy. Who's a guy. Being a
           guy...
          Mercy turns her face to the sky...

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

          The streets are not yet crowded with traffic.

                         
          A MOTORCYCLE RIDER pilots a STATE OF THE ART STREET MACHINE:
          machine helmet, leather pants and jacket, radio in the
          helmet, saddlebags, windscreen. Probably a gynecologist.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERSECTION - SAME

          The cyclist pulls up right next to:

                         
          Larry Crowne, riding a scooter for the first time. Gives the

                         

                         

                         

                         
          passing Rider - who couldn't care less -- a 'thumbs up!'

                         

                          RIDER
           How you doing...

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Speck-tack-alar.

                          (THEN)
           Nice machine. Where you headed?

                          RIDER
           Work.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           School. College. I'm a student.
           What do you do?

                          RIDER
           I'm a gynecologist.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day'
           but that would be stating the

           35.

                         

                         
          The light changes.

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
           You take care.
          As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he
          stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.

                         

                         

          EXT. E.C.C.C. SCOOTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Larry is trying to work the kick stand of his scooter. He is
          not yet practiced at the thing. Another scooter rrives.

                          TALIA
           Where'd you get the Hot Wheels?
          Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails
          to recognize her from Econ prime.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           That machine's a classic.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                         

                         

                         
           Got me here for a nickel's worth of

                         
           gas.

                          TALIA
           You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I am?

                          TALIA
           That class is straining my coconut.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           It's only been one day

                          TALIA
           Didn't know you scooted.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           New to the sport.

                          TALIA
           (pulls out mobile phone)
           Give me your number. I'll
           introduce you to like-minded
           enthusiasts.

                          (THEN)
           Name please?

           36.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.

                          TALIA
           'Larry'? I don't think so. I used
           to be Kathleen but one day I looked
           in the mirror and saw a girl named
           Talia.
           (then in her phone)
           Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check
           your texts and we'll do us some
           scooting.

                          (THEN)
           Gotta tell you, Lance. Tucking a
           polo shirt into khakis makes you
           look like a cop.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Not much fashion sense.

                          TALIA
           I know! Gotta change that...
          Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and
          doesn't want to be late again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         
           Gotta go!

                          TALIA
           Then get going!!
          Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...

                         

                         

          INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER

          Mercedes is at a desk in the back. Bored and, yes, a bit
          hungover again. You can tell by the way she takes long pulls
          from her Thermo-cup.
          Busik is sitting in on the class, not far from Mercedes.

                         
          In front of the board that says "PHONES OFF!!" Calimeris is
          demonstrating an exercise for her speech.

                          CALIMERIS
           With the push-up added, the 4-count
           Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie
           and works out the pecs and biceps.
           It's an all-in-one exercise perfect
           for Cheerleader conditioning. The

                          6-COUNT BURPIE

           37.

                         

                         
          The class is too shy to applaud though Busik claps like a
          fan.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           We now all know how to Burpie.
           Thank you.

                          (THEN)
           Who's next?
          No one volunteers. Though Pinedo is about to...

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
           Make me the bad guy.

                          (HER ROSTER)
           Ms. Crowne?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You mean me?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Mr. Crowne. My bad.
          Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.

                         
          Busik shoots him a 'thumbs up.'

                         
          He looks at Mercedes for the starting cue.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT(CONT'D)
           Go.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           My presentation will be on the
           subject of a very particular
           procedure. "How to make French
           Toast", but I'll speak English...
          Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks
          to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           M classes were once filled with
           e rnest young men ready to learn
           all I had to teach them. Cute boys
           fresh out of High School who all
           had crushes on me from day one. Now
           look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound
           for jail. Mack. Treating college
           like another tour of combat.
           Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd
           be Osric in Act 5. The part that is
           always cut.

           38.

                         

                         
          Larry checks on Ms. Tainot in the back. She is not talking,
          only listening (the MOVIE DEVICE mentioned above)...

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Busik, I am going to kill you. You
           can't suggest these saps take
           Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me
           in at this ungodly hour for 2
           minutes on French toast?
          Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about
          Larry.
          She is a stone face.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Most people think syrup comes out of
           a plastic bottle.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           (still talking to herself)
           Great. The history of the sugar
           maple tree now. Thank you
           Wikipedia.
          Larry still has a dozen cards to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

                         
           Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           That went fast...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Breakfast may never be ready.
          Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Next.
          Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...

                         

                          DIBIASI
           I'll go. But you aren't going to
           like it.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Are you clairvoyant?

          Larry is taking notes, beside Lala, when his phone vibrates.
          He flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble.
          On his phone a message: TALIA: "Scoot?"

                         
          It takes a moment for him to understand what is going on.

                         
          His phone buzzes again.

          Larry looks as instructed. He sees Talia, phone in hand,

                         LATER
          Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia
          walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.

                          TALIA
           Hey Monkey!
          Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses
          him back. Larry sinks a little.

           40.

                         

                         
          It only figures Talia would have a boyfriend like Dell Gordo.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           This is Lance Corona. Classmate and
           good guy, so far.

                          DELL GORDO
           Dell Gordo. You want to ride with
           us?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Why not.
          There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry,
          but then Dell starts to snap his fingers --
          SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all
          snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.

                          TALIA
           Snap along, Lance or you can't join
           the gang.
          Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          DELL GORDO

                         
           Okay. You're in for a trial run.
          And just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.

                          STAN
           Not many of these '66 Wasps left
           around. They had low torque.
           How's the torque?
          He means Larry's scooter.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I just bought it and ride around.
          Someone yells "Saddle up!"

                         

                          TALIA
           Stan knows engines and junk.

          Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from
          Talia-on-the-heart.

          The squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with
          Larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd...

          They roll through town - a multi-wheeled dance troupe.
          Swaying... turning... slow-motion sometimes... elegant
          always.
          They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas...
          rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to
          do...

          As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye
          the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts
          in the parking lot.
          He misses that place...

          One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The

          Talia does a mime of Larry cooking - like a spastic drummer.

           He is?
          Larry goes to the window.

                         

                          DELL GORDO
           Said the thing was a time bomb.

          Stan has broken down much of Larry's bike using Lamarr's
          tools. Lamarr is standing over him, pointing out what he

          Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips --
          no romance at all, but still...

           Did you notice? No script. No

          The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some
          DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.

          INT TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - LATER
          Dean is opening take-out containers to put the food on
          plates. The table is set a little too ornately. Wine.

                          HE'S
          Candles. Flowers.
          In other words, he's making up.

                         
          Mercedes comes in through the door. Sees what's up.
          being good and cute. He pours Margaritas.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm
           a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful
           and brilliant. And I will be a
           good boy from now on. Why?
           Because you're right and I've
           learned my lesson. Just don't be
           mad at me forever. I have a
           pliable soul and I pray you do too

          Mercedes and Dean have had make up sex. It was okay.

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Ah. That was nice.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It was. Yes.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Been thinking. If you ever want to
           take a whack at writing something --
           say a blog a couple of times a week --
           I could help you out.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           How?

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I'd read your stuff. Make comments
           to make it web-savvy. Pieces need

           See? You can't stay mad at me. No
           reason to be mad at me...
          He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.

                         

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I'm just a guy who's a guy being a

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm going to miss a few months on
           the checks for the house.

                          DENISE
           Okay.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I hoped not to, but I there it is.

                          DENISE
           Okay. Yeah.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm sorry.

           Let's start with six.
          Silence on the other end.

                         

                          DENISE
           That can't happen, Larry.
           I'm extended. I've put a deposit
           down on the first vacation I've had
           in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as
           valid as yours, so I need the
           checks like always. A deal's a
           deal.
          He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP

          One record is going for... $0.75. Another: $1.25. Another:

           I don't have it.

                         

                          DENISE
           That's not my problem. Take out a
           loan on the house or something.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I tried. I'm too much of a risk.

                          DENISE
           Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't
           want to open up the whole lawyer
           thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks,
           doesn't it? I appreciate the
           rigorous Crowne honesty, but this
           can't happen.

          INT. ECON 1 - LATER

          Dr. Matsutani is in mid-lecture when Larry comes in, late.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                          (QUIETLY)
           I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani.
           May I still sit in the class?

           DR. MATSUTANI
           This is college, Mr. Crowne. The
           only thing you can't do is smoke in
           the building. Hand over your
           phone.

                          (LARRY DOES)
           I'm going to ask a question in a
           moment. I want someone other than
           you to answer it - I don't care if
           the silence is positively Arctic.
          Larry moves to take a seat.

                         
          Talia can't believe his choice of dress. She mimes to him
          "What's with the outfit?" His mime answer is unintelligible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)

                         
           This brings us to a dreaded task to
           every corporate entity. What is
           the purpose of semi-annual re-
           purposing? Anyone?

                          (THEN)
           Anyone?
          He waits. And waits. And waits. Matsutani stares fear into
          the hearts of all but Larry.

          Mercedes Tainot is crossing campus when she sees Larry.
          Talia is moving around his hair, showing it to a SCOOTER
           QUAD HAIR STYLIST. Lala is weighing in with her opinion on
          Larry's hair .

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Is that Larry Crowne!?

                          (HE STOPS)
           You have a lot of nerve showing
           your face on campus after ditching
           my class!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not
           miss another class, this I vow.

           Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne.
           You'll lead off next assignment
           with three minutes on a personal
           first. A story, with details, not
           a laundry list or slide show. And,
           as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to
           hear about the first time you got
           laid.
          She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Or the most recent.
          Talia laughs out loud!

                         

                          TALIA
           That woman is one clenched fist of
           fury.

           That makes me cranky, too.

           Without a workout in the Inner

          Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's
          wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           She's marred.

                          TALIA
           You'd kill two birds in one bush.
           Nothing wrong with a campus
           romance. Otherwise life is what?
           Breakfast work, coffee, school,
           lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk,
           Mexican food, a movie, glass of
           wine or two then bed? That's not
           living.

           SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST
           Not without some smooching time.

                          TALIA
           Bet she'd give you an A plus.

          Larry has filled out a bunch of papers and is sitting down
          with Laurie Gammelgaard, who offers him coffee.

                          LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
           More complimentary coffee?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Complimentary coffee is usually
           lousy.

                          LAURIE GAMMELGAARD
           I drink it all day.

           It's been a few weeks.

                          LAURIE GAMMELGAARD

          The windows are fogging up. Frances and Mercedes sip take-

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           I never read them.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Who did? I'm married to an ex-
           teacher turned blogger with two
           books in print. And oh, yes, he has
           the libido and internet access of a

          Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia
          with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Because, as I learned in your
           class, I am one of a kind.
          Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her.
          He never sees Mercedes or Frances.

           FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (CONT'D)
           Hey, that guy's in your class.
          Mercedes wipes fog off the window.

           And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a

          Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           That's why he's in college! To get
           laid!

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           It happens.
          Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of
          donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a
          ring of sweet into his mouth.
          Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.

           You are everything that's wrong
           with America, Larry Crowne!
          They did not hear her.

                         

                         

          INT SPEE H 217 - MORNING
          Larry is at the podium, prepping his "Personal First"
          presentation as the class comes in. He is dressed as Talia
          styled him.

                          DIBIASI
           Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know
           you were gay. You've gone all
           Project Runway on us.
          Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is
          oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the
          room as the class goes quiet.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Should I begin?
          Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'

           (talking to herself in the MOVIE

                          DEVICE WAY)
           Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.

                          (THEN)
           Look at the new pants. They
           actually fit. And that jacket is
           'smart'. Did Busik put Larry
           Crowne into Fashion for Creeps? An
           old goat dressed like lamb.

                          (THEN)
           Of course! It's that doe-eyed
           young thing he's been wearing on
           his sleeve. Dressing like he's
           half his age. Give me a shotgun!
           I'll pepper Larry Crowne right now!

                          (THEN)
           Am I being unfair? I mean, if I
           were single and some young buck
           took to me, wouldn't I be inclined
           to diddly-dally?
          She looks at Dibiasi, who has snuck iPod earbuds onto his
          head, is mouthing the words and playing air guitar.

                          DIBIASI
           (jerking out buds)
           What? What he say?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Unless you're looking at a chart,
           you don't even know the Equator
           when you cross it...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           A repackaged Larry Crowne won't
           fool me. Shame on you. Going
           after jail bait, you criminal.
           Insert Viagra joke here...

                          (THEN)
           herself at you... No. Don't let
           up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY!
          Polite applause. Mercedes pretends she heard every word.

           70.

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Anyone recall anything from that?

                          PINEDO
           That Larry believed there were
           signs on posts marking the Equator.

                          CALIMERIS
           And that, when it's a first time,
           they make the rookies dress in drag
           and sing Abba songs?
          Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.

                         

                          MACK
           Larry worked on an Aircraft
           Carrier! Night Carrier Landings
           are the trickiest flying in world.
          Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           That was a memorable nugget.

          More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech.
          Mercedes heard none of them...

          Talia is riding alone. She slows at a TATTOO PARLOR...

          Larry bangs out orders.

                         
          Raul sits at the butchers block, sipping coffee, observing
          his new kitchen staffer.

          An empty store right next to the Tattoo Parlor. Talia is

          A hand-drawn sign with an arrow says "FOR LEASE ENQUIRE NEXT

          Larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his
          studies out -- trying to do two jobs at the same tim
          His mobile phone vibrates.
          TALIA: "Scoot?"

                         
          He punches in

                         
          "Can't. Job."

                         
          He goes back to his studies just as another order comes up.
          Then his phone vibrates again.
          TALIA: "Job? Sob! Coming!"

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm not complaining. I'm stating
           the truth. I teach while you
           pretend to work.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I had three postings today alone.

           Those weren't postings. They were
           comments.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to
           judge me?

                          (THEN)
           I know what's really pissing you
           off. I like big titties. And you
           don't have any.
          Yeow. A line has been crossed. A big, ugly line has just
          been crossed. Even Dean knows it.

           DEAN TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Maybe I should take that back.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           LET ME OUT OF THIS FUCKING CAR!!!

                         

                         

          EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

          A young couple -- call them JANET and TONY - have been on
          their first date. It's gone well.

           76.

                         

                         

                          JANET
           As soon as I saw you, I said, "I
           want to go out with that man."

                          TONY
           What did you say when I asked you
           out?

                          JANET
           I said "Yes." You were there,
           remember?

                          TONY
           I saw you and I thought "I would be
           a lucky guy if she'd go out with
           me."

                          JANET
           Yes you are.

                          TONY
           Honestly, this is about as good a
           first date goes, isn't it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          JANET

                         
           Disaster looms on most first dates,
           but I'm talking to you like you're a
           friend I want to make out with.

                          TONY
           Hold that thought.
          Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.

                         
          Mercedes is out of the car before it even stops.

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I take it back. I take it back.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Drive, asshole! Drive away!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I've been drinking, too.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Drive straight til you hit a cliff
           on the coastline!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You win! I'm letting you win!
           Everything you say is right and

          WIN!

           77.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With
           a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Screw you, you washboard!

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Oh, chillax!!!

                          GPS VOICE
           Please enter your destination.
          Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock
          and hurls it at him.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
          Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           The jerk who just deserted me? My
           husband of 4 friggin' years!
          She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know
          what to do with each other now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. BUSINESS STREET - LATER


                         
          Mercedes is walking home. It's a bit longer than she would
          like. She comes to a bus stop and studies the route. She
          sits and removes her shoes.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I loved these shoes once. Stupid
           shoes.
          She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does
          cry, for so any reasons.
          In the distance, we hear...

                         
          The ROAR of SCOOTERS. Then here they come. A night-time
          'Scoot'.
          All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and
          Talia.
          Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the
          bus stop. She slows.

           78.

                         

                         

                          TALIA
           Lance! Chick alert!
          Larry is beside her. They stop.

                         

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           You are not going to believe how
           Fate meets cute!
          She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.

                         

                         BUS BENCH

                         
          Mercedes wonders who these Mock Wild Ones are that pull up to
          her.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ms. Tainot?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           No.
          He takes off his helmet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         
           Larry Crowne.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Jesus Christ.

                          TALIA
           And I've been calling you 'Lance'.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Do you need a ride? Hop on.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           And bust up your romp in the glen
           with Bambi?

                          TALIA
           Hey. Bambi was a boy.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I was heading home.

                          (TO TALIA)
           Right? We're done scooting?

                          TALIA
           Not me. I love riding in the
           night. Magic happens.

                          (TO LANCE)

           79.

                         

                         
          Away Talia scoots to catch up with the gang.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           What do men see in irritating free
           spirits?
          Mercedes starts walking.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Seriously. I offer you a ride.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Seriously. I don't want one.
          Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I've yet to give anyone a lift on
           this but I think I can get you home
           with a scraped elbow, worst case.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts
           black boil up from my soul. Major

                         

                         

                         

                         
           consequences sure to follow.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           An attractive woman like you
           walking alone is a dumb idea.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I need a man flirting with me right
           now like I need a dog crapping on my
           lawn. I'm hoofing it.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           In those shoes?
          Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           A man who notices shoes.

                          (GIVING UP)
           All right. I'll be your Cycle
           Slut.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Put this on.

                          (HIS HELMET)
           Strap your legs round my engine and

           80.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It won't be a terrible thing if you
           kill us both.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Ain't you a ball of fun?
          Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.

                         

                         IN MOTION

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Are you really going to go this
           slow?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I do want to survive this night.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Fine. I have time to window shop.
           Oh look, a sale on tires at
           AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox.
           I've never noticed their perfect
           design and colo scheme. This is

                         

                         

                         

                         
           so slow a cat could knock us over.

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. INTERSECTION - MINUTES LATER.

          Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is
          singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal".

                         

          EXT. STREET - RIDING SHOT - LATER - ON THE SCOOTER

          Larry shouts over his shoulder.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Where am I taking you?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Down to Portola and left to
           Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo.
           Right on Palermo till I yell stop.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I may use this as a presentation in
           class.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Try it and you'll flunk.
          I am joking.

           81.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I like your class. You're making
           us all do things we never thought
           we could.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Put the shovel away and just get me
           home, 'kay?
          Up ahead, flashing lights.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Hail our City's Finest.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Someone's getting pinched...
          A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a
          Drunk Driver.
          It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a
          test kit.
          Mercedes starts laughing.

                         
          As they pass the crime scene, Dean is being put into the back

                         

                         

                         

                         
          of the Prowler, cuffed...

                         
          Mercedes' laugh fills the night as they putt-putt along.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Measure his dick, officer! He's
           too diminutive to drive!

                          (THEN)
           Tiny dick loser!
          Larry doesn't know what to make of that.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Bad night for that guy.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Best night I've had in years!
           Drive on, McDuff!

                         

                         

          EXT. CEDAR HILLS TOWNHOMES - NIGHT

          In through the gates come our night crawlers. Mercedes is

           82.

                         

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

          Larry shuts off the motor. Mercedes is half asleep. She
          doesn't remember to take off Larry's helmet.

           Thanks for the ox-cart ride.
          Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I can see the Alarm Pad. I know
           the code. But my hands aren't
           working.

                          (THEN)
           Help me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You don't want to give me your pass

           Just hold my hand up to the
           numbers. I'll manage from there.
          Larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           Look away now.

                          (HE DOES)
           Two two two two. Pound.
          Larry heard every word.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car.
           The key please? It's buried in
           that plant.
          Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           This it?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Why I think it is!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'll get the door for you
          Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.

           83.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Take one step inside and I call
           security.
          Larry steps away from the door.

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           And forget this ever happened.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           This whole sorry chapter tonight.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You passing up Gidget for a flat
           old coot like me.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What are you talking about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           What, you have no short-term
           memory?
          Larry has been tying to be polite.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           When I say 'what', it means I get
           it and have already purposefully
           forgotten everything. Call it
           irony.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant
           lands in the drunk tank while
           Goofus scoots me home.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Goodnight, Ms. Tainot.
          She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not
           see that?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I assumed you preferred Ms

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           When we presume we make a pretty
           pair of asses of me and you or
           something like that.

                          (THEN)
           Why aren't you married?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           That's a long story and it's late.

                          (THEN)
           My helmet?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Help yourself.
          She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might
          kiss right now.
          Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking
          guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I noticed something on the ride.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                          WHAT

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                          IT MAY
           You smell good.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Thanks.
          He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head.
          be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Do you have a crush on me? Single
           student. Unattainable teacher. It's
           common.
          Larry has no idea what to say.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           We all have crushes on you. Even
           the gals.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           You want to make out with me, you
           can. I know I'm not a third rate

           My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5
           years.
          Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He
          shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot.
          Bang.

                         
          It's a pretty good whammy kiss. Makes her splay her arms and
          everything.
          Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept
          at it, too.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Wow...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Pretty dang good. I still got it,
           no?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Yes, you do..

                          (THEN)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           In you go.

                         
           (Mercedes goes in)
           Close the door.

                          (SHE DOES)
           Lock it!
          Larry hears the sound of the bolt. He walks away.

                         

          INT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

          Mercedes leans against the door. What did she just do????

                         

           LARRY CROWNE (O.S.)
           Goodnight, whoever you are!

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - SAME

          Larry wistfully starts his bike, looking back at the door.
          He will not forget that kiss or this night. He drives off.

                         

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

          A TAXI is pulling up. Out of the back, Dean, looking like he

           86.

                         

                         
          He pays the cabbie, pissed off about everything. Then his
          world gets much more complicated.

          P.O.V.

                         
          All his possessions, stacked up in front of the door. On the
          top of the heap, his computer. Turned on and showing porn

                          DEAN TAINOT
           Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...

          Mercy feels terrible, stepping from her car, brutally
          hungover.
          As she straightens up, her eye catches...

                         

                         LARRY CROWNE

                         
          On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking.

                         
          She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the
          memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that

          Mercy is trying to 'accidentally' run into Larry, but is
          caught by surprise when..
          He is walking right towards her. Oops. That would be
          uncomfortable. She DUCKS behind a pillar.
          Still wanting to 'bump' into the man who kissed her last
          night, she circumvents his path, stalking Larry like a
          birdwatcher tracks a blue-tailed swallow.
          Hopping behind a tree, Mercy's SHOE gets caught in some mud.
          Bending down, a branch catches her sweater and RIPS a seam.
          Stepping onto the pavement, the tree branch SMACKS her in the
          head.
          Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...

          Staying out of his eye line, Mercy navigates her way around
          to the other side of the Bench Area and preps her appearance
          before making a 180 degree reverse, guaranteeing a 'Meet'
          with Larry.
          Then she sees her.

          Sitting with others, greeting Larry with laughter and hugs
          and hoots. Talia is announcing to all how she left Larry
          with a drunken teacher last night, with her arm around his
          waist and affection in her eyes.

                         MERCY
          Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't
          understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a
          minute or two.

          away from the scene, and slinks away toward her class.

          INT. SPEECH 217 - DAY

          Mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed
          a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that Mercy is
          looking at Larry.
          Larry is listening to Lala with delight.

           Seeing them -- the Northern Lights,
           the Aurora Borealis -- should have
           been beyond me, but I was a little
           girl in Coach class still awake, a
           window seat, a moonless night
           somewhere over Greenland with a
           shimmering curtain of emerald,
           gossamer light dancing just for me.

                          (THEN)
           That is something I will remember
           forever.
          The SPEECH is over. The class erupts in applause for Lala,
          who has hit a home-run. Foremost of the fans, Larry, who
          rises in applause for the once quiet classmate.
          Then the applause is over.

           That was a knockout speech, Lala.
           Made the news. Caused riots
           downtown. School's out til 2019.
          The students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and

           Last i ht? Let's see, what was I
           doing? Studying some. Working
           some. Can't recall. I've forgotten
           everything that happened last night
           as best a gentleman can.

           But what happened last night --
           between adults -- was
           inappropriate. If gossip were to
           circulate, the problem could be
           more than just embarrassing. My
           status as a professor could be
           tarnished.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I wouldn't want that.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           at parties when I've had a bit too

           Sure. Nothing happened. At all.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           So there will be no bravado among
           you and your pals?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           None.

           Thank you, Mr. Crowne.

           have this same conversation with

          Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark

          EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

          Larry and Lamarr are sitting on the curb, watching kids play
          down the street. They run back and forth in front of them
          with a soccer ball.
          They both have pipes, with Lamarr showing him how to light
          up.

                          LAMARR
           Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.

                          (THEN)

           I have to sell my car.
          Put a new top on it.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           If I could afford a new top I could
           afford to keep it.

                          LAMARR
           What's the job paying you?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Half my UniMart salary.

                          LAMARR
           You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as
           dirt.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           I'm looking back on the year Denise
           left as the good old days.

                          LAMARR
           Hang in there, neighbor.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Everyone keeps saying that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          LAMARR

                         
           I was in the same spot. Look what
           happened.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           The odds of two people on the same
           street winning the lottery are
           worse than one person on the street
           winning the lottery.

                          LAMARR
           I read how the universe is
           expanding, Larry, taking us along
           with it. That is a wild concept to
           grasp, but what it means is, we all
           have to hold on tight sometimes to
           get to where we're going to be.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                          (THE PIPE)
           This thing must be making me dizzy.
           What?

                          LAMARR
           Keep your grip. You'll be okay.
           It's like the wife always says...
          Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a

                          LAMARR (CONT'D)
           A woman with a measuring tape?
           That's money in my pocket.
          A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his
          pipe flying.

          Trees. A picnic table. And Mercedes Tainot writing
          individual words on pages of a steno book.
          After each word, she folds each page many times and puts it
          in a basket.
          Up walks Dean Tainot, who looks neither happy nor cheerful.

           Thanks for coming.

           No notice. No preamble. Just an
           email and a google map.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I knew you'd be on the computer.

           So. What up.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Are we making a mistake here?

                          DEAN TAINOT

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Point made. We could change
           things. We could start right now.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           We could. Why should we?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Because we have history, Dean. But
           first, my thoughts... I've got to
           address drinking. I should be
           able to comprehend and respond to
           both sides of our conversations. And
           the morning shower should be
           refreshing, not a hangover cure.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I'd like that too.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Okay. Now, you.
          Dean is caught short.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           I see. I'm what this is all about.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           There are plenty of items on the
           relationship agenda but let's start
           here.

                          DEAN TAINOT
           You're talking about you but you
           really mean me.

                          (THEN)
           I am not yelling or begging or
           saying you have to stop doing
           anything. So you don't get to
           either.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm not saying that.

           95.

                         

                         

                          DEAN TAINOT
           We've both been here before. Why
           prolong the process? White flag! I
           give up. This ain't working.

                          (THEN)
           I'll sign papers and checks, see if
           there's enough for a cool sports
           car as a reward for the last few
           years and eventually I will be fine
           and you will too. But I am never
           once going to look at myself as
           another poor divorced guy who could
           still be married if only he had
           done the mea culpa bit for all his
           faults.

                          (THEN)
           I just now came up with that, and
           it is going to be my next posting.

           I don't think there is anything

          Dr. Matsutani is going on. Larry is looking for Talia, who
          is not in class.

           97.

                         

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI

                          (HIS BOOK))
           At the end of each chapter is a
           study guide. Master those and you
           will have mastered my book. Master
           my book and you will take over the
           world.
          He laughs demonically.

                         

           DR. MATSUTANI (CONT'D)
           By now you should be laughing with
           me.
          Larry can't believe Talia is not there...

                         

                         

          EXT. TALIA'S NEW STORE - LATER

          Larry scoots up. She is inside arranging a "Coming Soon!"
          window display. Dell Gordo, Stan, and the Squad are all
          inside building shelves and racks.
          She comes out of the store.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          TALIA

                         
           You digging what you see?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You missed Matsutani's class.
           Review for the final.

                          TALIA
           I'm done w th college.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           What? Why?

                          TALIA
           Because I'm going into business.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in
           school. Don't throw away your
           education.

                          TALIA
           And don't drink and drive or do
           drugs and quit smoking and eat
           vegetables. I don't. I stopped.
           I did. I do.

                          LARRY CROWNE

           98.

                         

                         

                          TALIA
           Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice
           gave us free tattoos. I wanted
           something in Japanese so check this
           out.
          She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two
          Japanese characters.

                          TALIA (CONT'D)
           That one says 'courage'. That one
           says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit.
          Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his
          gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Japanese characters go the other
           way and that says Soy Sauce.

                          TALIA
           Oh shut up.

                          LARRY CROWNE

                         

                         

                         

                         
           It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce.

                         
           Quitting school is for dopes.
          It does, actually say Soy Sauce. He is starting his scooter.

                          TALIA
           Be here for our Grand Opening!

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Might not make it. I have finals!

                         OPEN SKY

                         
          Larry comes into frame, with a hammer and stake.

                         

                         

          EXT. LARRY'S HOUSE - DAY

          He is pounding the FOR SALE sign into his front lawn.

                         
          Laurie Gammelgaard pulls up her new VW Bug with a COUPLE in
          the back seat. They get out and Larry nods as he waves them
          to the door.
          He remains on the lawn, looking at his neighborhood -- the
          kids, the dogs -- Lamarr across the street.
          It's all over...

           99.

                         

                         

          EXT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

          Frances and Mercedes have pulled up in her car.

                         

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           This place anonymous enough?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           As long as alcohol's out of my
           grasp.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           They have good pie, they say.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Great. Sugar can replace tequila
           in my bloodstream, my thighs, and
           the folds in my neck.
          They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible
          Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY

          OWNER."

           FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH (PRE-LAP)

                         

                         

                         

                         
           So. You're a mess.

          INT. PERRY'S COFFEE SHOP - SAME

          They sit in a back booth where she would never see Larry.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yep.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           You'd think leggy blondes like us
           would be impervious, right?
          At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the
          kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee.
          Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.

                         

                          PERRY
           Ladies. Bring an appetite?

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           The mark of a restaurant is their
           Key Lime pie.
          Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.

                         

                          PERRY

           100.

                         

                         

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           No Key Lime?

                          PERRY
           Cream pies I got.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Boston Cream?

                          PERRY
           Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady,
           you're killing me here.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.

                          PERRY
           Ma'am?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'll have the French Toast.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           French Toast?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

                         
           (on the menu)
           Breakfast all day.
          Perry leaves to put in the order.

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           You won't believe how far I fell on
           the Hooch-o-meter.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           I have seen it happen a time or
           two.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I kissed a boy.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           When, third grade?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           One of my students.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           You Hoor.

                          (THEN)
           Gimme the friggin' details! He's
           not a minor is he?

           101.

                         

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Older than me.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Hugh Hefner in your class? What
           went down?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           He sort of... rescued me. And...
           he smelled nice.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           He a fireman who bakes bread?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I wanted to be kissed so asked if he
           wanted to and he did.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Bold. Who is he?

                         KITCHEN

                         
          Perry slides over a plate of French Toast -- with one bite
          out of it. Larry looks up from his Econ. 1 Textbook.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          PERRY

                         
           You're slipping, Larry.

                          (THE TOAST)
           Lady says it's not French Toast as
           she knows it.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           She's insane.

                          PERRY
           Take it up with her.
          Larry heads out of the kitchen.

                         

                          PERRY (CONT'D)
           No shouting, okay? This is a
           family friendly establishment.

                         BOOTH

                         
          Here comes Larry, not yet seeing Mercedes.

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a
           problem with your order?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT

           102.

                         

                         
          Knock Larry over with a feather.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Mrs. Tainot.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

                          (TO MERCEDES)
           The student of yours!?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           This is Larry Crowne.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           There's no way in creation I screw
           up French Toast.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           It was fine, actually.

                          (THEN)
           I wanted to see if it was really
           you cooking back there. And say,
           howdy. Howdy doody.
          During the following, Frances is trying to get a whiff of
          Larry -- to find out how he smells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)

                         
           Ready for the final?

                          LARRY CROWNE
           You'll be the judge of that.
          The is a beat of silence.

                         

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
           So, your meal is satisfactory?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Absolutely.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Would you let my boss know so I
           don't lose this job?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Yes indeed.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Shall I prepare you another batch?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           No. Thanks.

           103.

                         

                         

                          LARRY CROWNE
           Then I will return to my station..
          Mercedes watches him go.

                         

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           You kissed the cook...

                          (THEN)
           I got a whiff. He smelled like
           bell pepper.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Look at the men in my life.

                          FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH
           Blame it on the booze... and
           collect yourself.

                          (THEN)
           You hoor...

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           That's my problem. I'm a drunken
           hoor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          KITCHEN FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH

                         
           That ends... right now.

                          (THEN)
           Check please?

                         

                         
          Larry comes back through the door, humiliation wracking his
          face. He tosses the French Toast down the disposal.

                         

                         

          INT. TAINOT TOWNHOME - LATER

          Mercedes and Frances are ATTACKING the house with vacuums,
          cleaners, and fortitude.
          BOOKS on Shakespeare and Shaw go on shelves where Dean's
          tomes used to rest. Computer wires are not even untangled,

          The street is empty. Larry is on his scooter, riding around
          and around and around the block that he will soon leave.
          He can see his NEIGHBORS through the open windows -- KIDS
          bouncing on a couch...A QUARTET OF OLD FOLKS playing cards
          and laughing... a MOVIE playing on a big TV.
          This was Larry's street...

                         

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. TAINOT TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

          Mercedes exits the door, crisp, clean -- like we've never
          seen her in the mornings. See the way she holds, not
          clutches, her Thermo-Cup?

                         

          EXT. LARRY CROWNE'S HOME - MORNING

          He's wearing a zipped up jacket. Kids and dog-walkers pass
          as his scooter starts pronto, he is off...

                         
          The FOR SALE sign on his lawn has an addition: IN ESCROW

                         

          INT. SPEECH 217 - LATER

          On the projected computer screen: A portrait of DISRAELI.

                         
          Dibiasi is giving his speech, but we are hearing Mercedes...

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           What a difference from day one. I
           must be a better teacher than I
           thought.

                          (THEN)
           Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris
           stopped up-talking. Lala you can't
           shut up. Mack spoke about
           Australia for three minutes and
           mentioned kangaroos only twice. And
           Larry Crowne...
          Larry is listening to Dibiasi, wearing what was once his
          UniMart polo, with his nametag and everything. Compared to
          the man he is now, that polo looks out of place..

           105.

                         

                         

           MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D)
           I was tough on him. But he learned
           fast. How he connected the Circle
           of Sales to the expanding universe
           is impressive as hell. I'll never
           forget about the Value Index now.
           He gave a perfect speech.

                          (THEN)
           And... He's polite. Instead of
           fighting me off that night, what
           does he do but kisses me one and
           then all but tucks me in. What kind
           of guy does that to a loopy tramp
           like me? He could have ravaged me.
           I misread this guy and if I had a
           brain I'd find a way to steal him
           away from that cutie pie and keep
           him for myself. I wonder if he'd
           like that, if he would... What did
           I just say?

                          (THEN)
           What did I just say about Larry
           Crowne?
          The class has stopped. It seems that Mercedes just said that
          last bit out loud and everyone heard it. The women eye each
          other. The men stifle laughs.

           Nothing. And I was just wrapping
           up here.

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           I'm so sorry. Please go on.

                          DIBIASI
           Larry? It okay if I get to my
           climax and denouement?
          Larry nods.

                         

                          DIBIASI (CONT'D)
           Thank you... If it was the romance
           novelist in him that made Victoria
           the Queen become such a pal, chalk
           it up as another brick in the
           legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of
           Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime
           Minister of Great Britain. Not bad
           for a Jewish guy, huh?
          Dibiasi is done. Applause.

           Congratulations all of you.

           Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we
           vote?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Not me, I have to stay objective.

                          MACK
           I say... Lala!
          They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her
          name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her.
          Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to
          pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          It's a spontaneous party that Mercedes has to back out of.

                         
          As she leaves, she looks back long enough to see Larry Crowne
          leading a parade around the room.

          He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying
          his kitchen, what was once his.
          Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.

          While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could
          of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears.
          And smelled him.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Seemed like years and years.

                          LARRY CROWNE
           All better now. Should be able to
           find your way.
          Nothing to do now but say goodbye.

                         
          They hear a pounding.

                         
          Raul is at the window inside the cafe, signaling the break is
          over.

           LARRY CROWNE (CONT'D)
           My Boss. Back to work.

          Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...

           Is Larry with you?

           Um, no. Should we track him down
           and drag him in here?
          Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.

          She may not realize it, but she is looking for Larry Crowne.
          Busik is busy chatting her up. Seriously chatting her up.

                          BUSIK
           All the excitement of first day of
           term, I don't want to go back to my
           empty apartment. Do you? I need a
           drink and some talk and some wind-
           down time. Don't you?

           DR. MATSUTANI (O.C.)
           Ms. Tainot?
          She turns.

           DR. MATSUTANI
           Larry Crowne is taking six units
           from me, devouring the material
           like a starving man.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Larry's enrolled?

           DR. MATSUTANI
           He's continuing his education and
           tells me it is because of you.
           That your class changed his life.
          Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...

                         

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Larry said that about me?

                          BUSIK
           Oh yeah! I put that guy in your
           class. So technically, I changed
           his life.

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           He is a good student

           And handy on a scooter.

                          (THEN)
           Is there any chance you would
           consider having drinks with an
           older faculty peer who holds a PhD
           in Economics?

                          MERCEDES TAINOT
           Well, no. No offense Dr. M.

           DR. MATSUTANI
           The rumor is you are newly single
           and I was just taking a shot.
          Mercy looks right at Busik.

          really does say 'Soy Sauce'.
          Mercedes has arrived. Talia sees her and comes out.

                         
          Lamarr is around. Patience, too.

                         
          We might notice that Dell Gordo and Larry now dress exactly

          Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on
          a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant.
          In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.
          Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.

                         
          Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly
          opens the door.
          The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny
          flat, but she can make out...
          Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.
          Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.

                         
          When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells
          her - her neck, her hair.

          Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him.

                    watch your back.
          
          We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
          
          
          INT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY
          
          Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man
          walking to his car.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Marvin? Hey, Marvin?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in
                    London?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's
                    going on?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Huh?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Johnnie said something about you
                    wanting him to present on Monday.
          
                              MARVIN
                    Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking
                    that, what with you being in London
                    - you should stay a while.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              MARVIN
                    There's no need to rush back. Enjoy
                    your daughter's wedding.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he
                    can pitch the Samuelson account.
          
                                                          3.
          
          

          
                              HARVEY
                    No, I'm coming back. Those are my
                    connections. They have been for
                    years.
          
                               MARVIN
                    I know but... they've got new
                    people running things over there. I
                    think they're after something...
                        (beat)
                    ...different.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I want to come back. I should be
                    there in person.
          
                              MARVIN
                    `There in person'? Harvey, nobody
                    cares.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I have to stand behind my music!
          
                              MARVIN
                    They're demos! - They're already
                    pressed. No one needs to be there.
                    They're not looking for you,
                    they're not looking for me. They
                    just need a fucking track.
                        (beat/sighs)
                    Harvey, you haven't booked a top
                    line in 8 months.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You got me doing triangle chimes
                    for Christ's sake - give me
                    something to compose!
          
                              MARVIN
                    That's what I'm trying to tell you!
                    It's not about composition! It's
                    different now!
          
          Silence. Harvey looks at Marvin.
          
                              MARVIN (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm
                    coming back.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          
          Beat.
          
                              MARVIN
                        (sighs)
                    You got to land this one, Harvey.
          
                               HARVEY
                    What are you saying?
                        (beat)
                    Say it!
          
                               MARVIN
                    I'm saying there are no more
                    chances, Harvey.
                        (beat)
                    Enjoy London.
          
          And with that Marvin gets in and drives   off, leaving Harvey
          standing alone in the car park. We hold   on his face - he's
          tired. He looks about him, then down at   his raincoat draped
          over his arm. He lifts it and drapes it   over the other arm.
          
                                                        CUT TO BLACK.
          
                               LAST CHANCE HARVEY
          
          Sound of interior airborne plane. The seat-belt `ping'
          chimes.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. PLANE - NIGHT
          
          Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from
          the now extinguished seat-belt light. He looks a little hot.
          Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking
          his drink into his lap.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Shit!
          
          An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks
          over.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (to a passing Stewardess)
                    Miss? I'm sorry. I've spilt my
                    drink.
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    I'll get you some napkins.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (to his neighbour)
                    Why's it always me?
          
          The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles
          noncommittally. The Stewardess returns.
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    Shall I take that?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thanks... And could I get another?
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    A whiskey, wasn't it?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.
          
          The Stewardess heads off. Harvey mops himself up. He places
          the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. Glancing
          out the window, he then turns to the woman.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    A holiday?
          
          The woman looks over.
          
                              WOMAN
                    No. Business.
          
          Harvey nods.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        (feeling obliged)
                    Yourself?
          
                              HARVEY
                    My daughter's getting married.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Congratulations.
          
                               HARVEY
                        (smiles)
                    Thank you.
                        (beat)
                    She's marrying an American. But for
                    some reason we've all got to go
                    over to London.
                        (smiling)
                    I told her we had a perfectly good
                    wedding system here.

                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (beat/expecting more of a
                         response)
                    They both work there, you see.
          
          The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess
          returns with Harvey's drink.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman
          interrupts.
          
                              WOMAN
                    I'm really sorry but I have a
                    meeting in the morning and I must
                    try and get some sleep.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No... Of course. I'm sorry.
          
                              WOMAN
                    It's just, I'll be useless - unless
                    I get some sleep.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Sure.
          
          The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her
          light, turning herself away from Harvey.
          
          We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of
          darkness.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          Sound of a commercial London Radio Station. A `phone-in'
          competition takes place.
          
                                                              FADE IN:
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
          
          A radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in
          a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She
          passes a postman - who nods his head.
          
                              POSTMAN
                    Morning Kate. Looking lovely as
                    ever. If I was younger...
          
                                                                     7.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                       Careful Paddy.
                           (pointing to her cheek)
                       Blushing! Is she up?
          
                                 POSTMAN
                       Oh yes.
          
          Kate smiles before unlocking the front door.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Kate comes through the door, picking up a small pile of mail
          off the floor.
          
                                 KATE
                           (calling out)
                       Mum. It's me - your daughter.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Kate puts the mail on a kitchen table. Just then MAGGIE,
          Kate's mum, enters in her dressing gown.
          
                                 MAGGIE
                       Hello, my daughter.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                       Have a cup of tea with me.
          
                                 KATE
                       I can't, I'm running late.
          
          Maggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to
          the kettle. Filling it up, she peers out the back window.
          
                                 MAGGIE
                       He's at it again.
          
                                 KATE
                           (looking through her bag)
                       Who? At what?
          
                                  MAGGIE
                       The neighbour. Barbecuing or
                       something.
          
          We see her POV of her neighbour busying himself in his back
          garden. Smoke rises from a small garden shed.
          
                                                             8.
          
          
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    I heard he's from Poland.
          
                               KATE
                        (pulling a small package
                         from her bag)
                    So maybe Polish people like to
                    barbecue a lot. I'm leaving your
                    prescription on the table.
                        (beat)
                    You know, you don't have to keep
                    taking these - the Doctor said.
          
                               MAGGIE
                    I like to. It makes me feel better.
                        (beat)
                    Its 8 o'clock in the morning. Who
                    barbecues at 8?
          
                              KATE
                        (looking at her watch)
                    I've got to go. I'll call you
                    later.
          
          Kate's mum sighs and turns away from the window.
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Of course. Don't worry about me.
                    I'll be Ok.
                        (beat)
                    Have you got that date thing
                    tonight?
          
                              KATE
                    I don't know, maybe.
                        (kisses her mother)
                    Bye Mum.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    `Time and tide', Kate, as your
                    father liked to say.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Was that from his terrace in the
                    South of France?
          
          Kate winces. Kate's mum looks hurt.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. That was mean.

                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Look, I'll call you later.
                        (kisses her mum again)
                    I love you.
          
          As Kate leaves, Maggie watches her go. She sighs, before
          returning her attention back to the window.
          
          POV: The Neighbour enters his smoking shed and closes the
          door.
          
          
          EXT. HIGH ST - DAY
          
          A busy High St. Kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus.
          
          
          INT. BUS - DAY
          
          Close up on Kate's face gently swaying. She stands reading a
          paperback, oblivious to the crowded bus around her.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Kate sits reading on a speeding train.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT / TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
          
          The Heathrow Express comes into the station. Kate disembarks.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate arrives at a booth. A sign reads: `PSA - Public
          Statistics Agency'. A West Indian woman, dressed in the same
          green uniform, stands waiting. She holds a newspaper, folded
          open at the crossword.
          
                               KATE
                    Aggie.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Morning darling.
          
          Kate goes behind the counter and turns on a light. As the
          booth illuminates, Kate unlocks a door behind and goes in.
          Without looking up from her crossword, Aggie follows.
          
          
          INT. PSA / LOCKER ROOM - DAY
          
          Kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of
          heels. Sitting down to put them on, Aggie enters.
          
                                                                  10.
          
          
          
                              AGGIE
                    Four across. A filmy layer on the
                    surface of a liquid?
          
          Kate thinks for a beat.
          
                               KATE
                    Scum.
          
          Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just
          as another co-worker hurries in.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Sorry. Sorry.
          
          She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Thank God you're my boss.
          
          Without looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head. Oonagh
          decides to ignore.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Are we still on for tonight? Matt's
                    definitely bringing Simon.
          
                               KATE
                    No.
          
                               OONAGH
                    Please.
          
                              KATE
                    Only if you guys swear you won't
                    leave if it's not going well.
          
                               OONAGH
                    No way.
          
                               KATE
                    Promise?
          
                               OONAGH
                    Promise.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Seven down. Another word for
                    `souvenir'?
          
          Kate thinks for a beat.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    Memento.
          
          Aggie laughs and scribbles it in. Oonagh rolls her eyes.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Aggie, why do you bother? You just
                    get Kate to give you all the
                    answers.
          
          Aggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away. Kate hands Oonagh a
          clip-board and the two of them head out.
          
          
          INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY
          
          As luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on. He sees
          his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off.
          
          
          INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY
          
          Oonagh and Kate stand next to each other, interviewing
          returning travellers. Kate interviews an elderly couple. It's
          clear she's good at her job.
          
                              KATE
                    So you spent the whole 2 weeks in
                    the Toronto area?
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Yes. Our daughter lives there, see.
          
                               KATE
                    Ah.
                        (filling in a form)
                    So not a business trip then?
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Oh, no. Unless you count grand-
                    children as work.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiles)
                    Some might.
          
          
          INT. ARRIVAL DOORS
          
          Harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling
          his case behind him.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY
          
          Kate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple, and
          turns to see an approaching Harvey in the distance. She
          registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her, but
          matches his movements, bringing him to a stop.
          
                              KATE
                    Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a
                    few very quick questions, could I?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a
                    hurry.
          
                              KATE
                    It won't take a moment.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (starting to walk on)
                    Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you
                    know?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes. I do.
          
          Beat. Kate's directness, brings Harvey to a stop. He turns to
          look at Kate. She smiles. Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Harvey continues on, glancing back once more as he walks
          away. Kate turns to Oonagh and shrugs, before returning her
          attention back to the sea of arrivals.
          
          
          EXT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls away from the Terminal.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - DAY
          
          Harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hi Suzie, it's your Dad. I've made
                    it in one piece. I'm in a Taxi on
                    my way to the Hotel. I guess i'll
                    see you all there. Can't wait. Love
                    you.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          
          Harvey hangs up. He dials another number.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here.
                    Just wanted to confirm Mike for
                    Monday. I'm in London at the
                    moment, but reachable on my cell.
                    Which is... Well you've probably
                    got it on file, but just in case,
                    917... Well you may have to dial an
                    international code first, I'm not
                    sure. Anyway, it's 917 749 7558.
                    That's 917 74...
          
          A sharp `beep' cuts him off. Harvey hangs up and looks out
          the window. Cranes loom on the horizon. He yawns.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL - DAY
          
          The Taxi pulls into the forecourt of a mid-market West End
          London Hotel. Harvey gets out and pays the driver.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
          
          Harvey approaches the front desk.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hi. I'm with the wedding party.
                    There should be a room for me.
                    Harvey Shine.
          
          The Concierge taps into his computer.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    Yes. I have a double room for you.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Good. Has everyone else checked in?
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    I'm not sure, sir.
          
                              HARVEY
                    My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe
                    she's already going by Wright.
                    Susan Wright.
          
          The Concierge taps some more.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    No, sir. No one of that name.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Do you have a Mrs Pearce?
          
          More tapping.
          
                               CONCIERGE
                    No, sir.
          
          The Concierge looks at Harvey. Beat. Harvey shrugs.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'll go up.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
          
          Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes
          off his jacket and goes to the window.
          
          A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no
          avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to
          duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out.
          
          Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy
          street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He
          tries again - but it won't budge.
          
          He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted
          blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower
          the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and
          unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window
          sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in semi-darkness.
          
          Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to
          the bed and retrieves it.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Hello?
                        (beat)
                    Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here.
                    Where are you - where is everyone?
                        (listens/Harvey's face
                         drops a little)
                    Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I
                    thought the plan was for everyone
                    to stay together.
          
          Noticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    No its...fine. I just wasn't sure.

                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    So your mother has rented a house
                    for you all.
                        (beat)
                    I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm
                    a big boy. It's fine.
          
          Harvey looks around the bland room.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Home from home.

                    Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll

                    I love you too. Bye.
          
          Harvey hangs up.

          Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her
          phone rings.
          
                                 KATE

                    Now don't be nervous. Just be

          Kate comes through the door. Oonagh sits on her own at a
          booth. Kate joins her.

                    Very suspicious.

                        (smiles)
                    I know.
          
                              OONAGH
                    I got you the same as me.
                        (off Kate's gaze)
                    They're at the bar. He seems very
                    nice.
          
          Just then two guys approach from the bar.
          
                                MATT
                    Hey Kate.
          
                                KATE
                    Hi Matt.
          
          Matt embraces Kate, then turns to his friend.
          
                              MATT
                    Kate, this is Simon.
          
                                SIMON
                    Hi.
          
          Simon shakes Kate's hand. Kate blushes ever so slightly.
          
                                KATE

                    Yes. If you can call it work.
          
                                                                  18.

          Awkward pause.

          Harvey puts on a cream linen jacket, that matches a pair of
          slacks. He looks at himself in a full length mirror. He looks
          good. There is a knock at the door, just as his phone rings.
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Room service.
          
          Harvey opens the door, as he answers his phone.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just over by the bed. Thank you.
                    Hello?
          
          A young African man wheels in a trolley with a pot of tea and
          some biscuits.
          
                              YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
                    Shall I open this for you?
          
          He heads towards the window. Harvey turns.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Careful!
          
          Too late. The blind wips up - toggle hitting the young man in
          the eye.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Are you Ok?
          
          The porter, covering his eye, nods, backing towards the door.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          
                              YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
                    Oh, yes. Yes, fine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Are you sure? Here.
          
          Harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats
          rapidly. The door closes. Beat. Harvey returns the phone to
          his ear.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          No answer. He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just
          then his phone rings again. He reaches for it, knocking the
          trolley and the tea onto himself.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Fuck!
          
          Grabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers.

          From a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch
          our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in
          the air.
          
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          A cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey
          steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting
          a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The
          cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters. Three young men stand to one side, chatting
          animatedly. On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up.

                      Yes.
          
          Scott turns to his friends.

                          (glancing at Harvey's

                      Its great to see you.
          
                                HARVEY
                      Good thanks. Great.
                          (sensing his gaze)
                      How are you holding up?
          
                                SCOTT
                      Great.
                          (turning to his friends)
                      Can't wait to marry your daughter,
                      really.
          
          Laughter.
          
                                   HARVEY
                      No...
                          (beat)
                      Is she..?
          
                                SCOTT
                      She's through there. She'll be
                      thrilled you're here. I'll go and
                      find her.
          
          Just then Harvey's phone rings.
          
                                   HARVEY
                      Sorry.
          
          Harvey turns away and answers.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Yes.
                        (listens)
                    No, no, that's not right. I booked
                    Mike. It's important. I spoke to
                    him about it two weeks ago. I
                    booked him.
                        (getting flustered)
                    Have you told him its Harvey. It's
                    really important...
                        (suddenly conscious of
                         Scott's friends standing
                         nearby)
                    Just...Just get him to call me, Ok?
          
          Harvey hangs up. And putting on his `positive' face turns
          back to Scott's friends.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
                        (beat)
                    Always something.
          
                               JOSH
                    Sure.
                        (beat)
                    What's your field, Harvey?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Oh, I'm a...
                        (beat)
                    I work in the music industry.
          
                              JOSH
                    Wow. Doing what?
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'm a composer.
                        (beat)
                    Sort of.
          
                              PETE
                    Cool. What kind of stuff?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Oh, you know, for...commercials,
                    that sort of thing. TV.
                        (beat)
                    Mostly background stuff, that sort
                    of thing.
          
                              JOSH
                    I see.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              PETE
                    Sounds profitable.
          
                               HARVEY
                    It can be.
                        (wanting to change
                         subject)
                    You guys work with Scott?
          
                              PETE/JOSH
                    Yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oil, right?
          
                              JOSH
                    Futures, yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, I'm sure that's pretty
                    profitable too.
          
          The guys smile a little too readily.
          
                              JOSH
                    Sometimes, yes.
          
          Harvey tries to smile back.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, I'd better find my daughter.
          
                              PETE
                    Absolutely. Good to meet you,
                    Harvey. See you in there.
          
          As Harvey moves off into the adjacent room, the guys watch
          him go.
          
          
          INT. PUB / HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kate and Oonagh wait in line for the bathroom.
          
                              OONAGH
                    So?
          
                              KATE
                    He seems nice.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
          
                              OONAGH
                    Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like
                    dull.
          
                              KATE
                    Nice like how old is he?
          
          Oonagh smiles.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Old enough. Your age...ish.
          
                              KATE
                    He can't be, he's looks like a
                    baby.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Alright, my age. But Matt says he's
                    very mature.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh right. Did Matt offer that up -
                    or was that in response to you two
                    discussing my approaching
                    barrenness.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Kate?
          
          Just then Kate's phone rings.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Don't answer it.
          
                               KATE
                    I have to. She's on her own.
                        (beat)
                    She gets lonely.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Just tell her you're busy.
          
          Kate nods and indicates that the loo is free. Oonagh goes in,
          as Kate answers her phone.
          
                              KATE
                    Mum?
          
          
          INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to
          one side, with Scott, talking to some friends.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          She looks beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As
          she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her
          father and joins him.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Hi Dad.
          
                               HARVEY

                    You look beautiful.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Give us a hug then, as they say in
                    this country.
          
          They embrace. Beat. Off Susan's look...
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I know, I look ridiculous.
          
                              SUSAN
                    No. You look...
          
                              HARVEY
                    Like a bad lounge act.
          
          Susan smiles at her Father. Beat.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I spilt something on my trousers.
                        (beat)
                    I've been doing that a lot
                    recently.
          
          Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh
          with his buddies.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Dad.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Long way to come to see two
                    American kids get married.
          
          Susan looks at her father, a little irked.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
          Harvey looks at his daughter.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Sorry.
          
          Beat.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Have you seen mum yet?
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. They're here?
          
                              SUSAN
                    Yes. They're over by our table.
          
          Harvey looks over.
          
                              SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    Please Daddy.
          
                               HARVEY
                    What?
                        (beat)
                    I'll be good.
          
          Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends
          over to say hello.
          
                              SCOTT
                    Look who i've got!
          
          Susan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach.
          Susan turns to greet them.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'll speak to you later Suz. You
                    enjoy your friends.
          
          As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt
          has his jacket on.
          
                              OONAGH
                        (to Kate)
                    We've gotta go. Problem at home.
                    Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing
                    serious.

                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (beat)
                    But you guys stay.
          
          Kate makes eyes at Oonagh, who shrugs innocently. Oonagh goes
          to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon.
          
                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (under breath)
                    Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow.
                    And turn off that phone.
                        (beat)
                    Are you working tomorrow?
          
                              KATE
                    Yes. Half-day.
          
                              OONAGH
                    I'll see you Tuesday.
          
          Oonagh kisses Kate and heads off with Matt, leaving Kate
          standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated Simon.
          
                              SIMON
                    Looks like we've been set up.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry.
          
                              SIMON
                    No. It's not your fault. I mean,
                    I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy
                    to meet new people.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes, me too.
          
                              SIMON
                    Why don't you sit down?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
          
          Kate sits down.
          
                              SIMON
                    So you're Oonagh's boss?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.

                    Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot.

                                SIMON
                    Yes.
                        (smiles)
                    You are.
          
          They share a smile.
          
                              SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Do you want another drink?
          
                              KATE
                    Ye...
                        (smiles)
                    Sure. I can get them.
          
                              SIMON
                    No, it's fine. What do you fancy?
          
                              KATE
                    I'll have another white wine.
                    Anything dry.
          
          Simon heads off to the bar. Kate watches him go. She allows
          herself a smile.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT/BAR AREA - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey. Picking up
          another glass, he turns away, and with drink in hand,
          approaches a group of people standing around a table. As he
          nears, a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white
          hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman
          standing next to him. She turns around to see Harvey
          approaching.
          
                                JEAN
                    Harvey.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Jean.
          
          Harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods.
          
                                HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Brian.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Harvey. Good to see you.
          
          There is a palpable sense of tension in the air.
          
                                                         28.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (deliberately only
                         directed to Jean)
                    So our baby girl is really getting
                    married. Who would've thought?
          
                              JEAN
                    Yes.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Harvey you remember the Watsons.
                    Barry and Jill.
          
          Harvey turns to a couple, standing nearby.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (slight sarcastic tone)
                    Of course I do. Hell, its been a
                    while. I guess, not since Jean and
                    I split up.
          
                              JILL
                    Hi Harvey. You look well.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thank you, Jill. You're looking
                    well too. Both of you. I guess you
                    guys stayed in touch with Jean.
          
          Awkward Beat.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Barry and I work together now.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No kidding? Insurance?
          
                              BARRY
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    Property, now. A small portfolio
                    down in Florida.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Real Estate. That's great.
                        (beat)
                    That's really great.
          
          Awkward silence.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
                              BRIAN
                    Well I think we should sit. I know
                    Susan wanted us all seated before
                    they joined us.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Sure. Good idea.
          
          Everyone begins to take their assigned seats. Harvey is on
          the inside close to the middle. It's a bit tight and involves
          people getting up to make way. Harvey gets to his seat and is
          just about to sit when his phone rings. Brian and Jean share
          a look. Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the
          incoming number.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, I have to take this.
                        (picks up)
                    Can you hold a minute?
          
          Harvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to
          stand again.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Sorry.
          
          Harvey walks away from the table.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits waiting. Simon has finally been served and turns
          from the bar with drinks in hand. As he does a young woman,
          standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy,
          greets him. Kate looks on. It's obvious from Simon's reaction
          that they know each other well. Just then Kate's phone rings
          again. She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it,
          but in the end, reluctantly picks up.
          
                               KATE
                    Mum. You've got to stop calling.
                        (beat)
                    What? I can't hear. Hold on.
          
          Kate gets up and moves towards the back-room.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands on the phone.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (getting more and more
                         flustered)
                    It'll take two hours max. No
                    longer.
                        (listens)
                    Have you told him its Harvey? Look,
                    we go back! He'll tell you. Just
                    have him call me.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey returns to the table. Everyone is seated.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Sorry...
          
          He notices his name place has been moved to the end.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (smiling/to Jean)
                    Did you move me darling?
          
                              JEAN
                    No, Harvey. I didn't touch it.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Dad. I moved you. I thought it
                    might be easier in case you needed
                    to get out.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ok, sweetheart.
          
          Harvey takes the last remaining seat. Brian stands.
          
                               BRIAN
                    Shall we have a quick toast to get
                    things going?
                        (beat)
                    I'm going to save my big speech for
                    tomorrow.
                        (laughter)
                    Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just
                    want to take us all back to that
                    wonderful holiday we all had in
                    Rome together last year and wish
                    you `Salute'!
          
                               EVERYONE
                    Salute!
          
                                                                     31.
          
          
          
                              BRIAN
                    Jean and I love you both so much.
                    And we're so happy that Scott is
                    going to part of our clan now. And
                    so I say many, many, happy, happy
                    years ahead. Salute!
          
                                 EVERYONE
                    Salute!
          
                                 HARVEY
                    My turn?
          
          Everyone turns to Harvey as he stands to make a speech. Just
          then his phone rings on vibrate.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
          
          Harvey scrambles to turn it off, as Jean rolls her eyes.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, I thought it was off.
                        (flustered he finally
                         manages to stop it
                         buzzing)
                    Um, uh.
                        (beat)
                    To Susan and Scott. A great couple.
                        (beat)
                    Cheers.
          
          Momentary awkward silence.
          
                                 EVERYONE
                    Cheers.
          
          Harvey sits.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Let's eat.
          
                                 EVERYONE
                    Yes...
          
          Everyone tucks in. Harvey sits slightly blushing at the end
          of the table, knowing he's blown it.
          
                                                                  32.
          
          
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate hangs up and returns to the main room, to find that
          Simon has been joined at their table by the young group. Kate
          bolsters herself before returning to the table.
          
                              KATE
                    Hi.
          
                               SIMON
                    Hey. Kate.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry, i bumped into these guys and
                    couldn't shake them.
                        (turning to his friends)
                    Everyone this is Kate.
          
          Kate holds up her hand, before blushing a little.
          
                              KATE
                    Hi.

                    Hi.
          
          Kate sits down.
          
                              MELISSA
                    Sorry, I hope we're not barging in
                    on your evening.
          
          Kate shakes her head.
          
                              MELISSA (CONT'D)
                    It was Simon's idea. How do you
                    guys know each other, anyway?
          
          Kate glances at Simon.
          
                              KATE
                    We don't really. We just met.
          
          Melissa looks at Simon and grins.
          
                              MELISSA
                    A blind date?
          
                                                                  33.

                    We met through friends.
          
                              MELISSA
                    I see. I think we should leave you
                    guys alone.
          
                                KATE
                          (a little too abruptly)
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    Don't. Stay. It's fine.
          
          Slightly awkward pause, broken by Andrew.
          
                              ANDREW
                    Hey does anyone know the cricket
                    score?
          
                              SIMON
                    England were all out by tea, when I
                    last checked.
          
                              ANDREW
                    Bloody hell.
          
                              GWEN
                    Cricket. Don't get it.
          
                              MELISSA
                    What? Men in white. Oh, I do.
          
          Kate looks on as the girls laugh.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone
          talks animatedly around him. He eats his food and drinks
          plenty of wine. Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with
          Brian. Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man,
          turns and catches her father's eye. He smiles at her and
          raises a glass. Susan smiles back before returning her
          attention back to her neighbour.
          
          
          INT. PUB BOOTH - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits among the group. She too seems to be detached from
          the proceedings.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              GWEN
                    I heard that they did it in her
                    bedroom, while she was away.
          
                              SIMON
                    It was her flat?
          
                              GWEN
                    Yep. He has his own, but was
                    basically living at hers.
          
                                ANDREW
                    Ouch.
          
                              MELISSA
                    That is evil.
          
          As the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at
          Simon. He seems more at ease in this company.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The meal is drawing to a close. People have gotten up and are
          circulating around the table and nearby.
          
          
          INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands at the bar. He downs a drink. Jean approaches.
          
                                JEAN
                    Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello Jean.
          
                              JEAN
                        (to barman)
                    Can I get a glass of water please?
          
          The Barman obliges.
          
                                JEAN (CONT'D)
                    You Ok?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (Downing another drink)
                    Fine.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                        35.
          
          
          
                            JEAN
                  Go easy Harvey.
          
                            HARVEY
                      (getting quite loaded)
                  Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm
                  going to embarrass you again?
          
                             JEAN
                  No Harvey, I'm worried you're going
                  to embarrass yourself.
                      (beat)
                  And more importantly Susan. This
                  weekend's just about her and Scott.
                  Nothing else.
          
                             HARVEY
                  Oh, you're good Jean. You're really
                  good. You've always known how to
                  make me feel shit, haven't you?
                      (beat)
                  You've always been so good at that.
          
                            JEAN
                  I've had cause to practice.
          
          Beat.
          
                            HARVEY
                  Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud
                  of me?
          
                             JEAN
                  Yes. Sometimes.
                      (beat)
                  But you never listened.
          
                            HARVEY
                  The parties Jean. The fuckin'
                  parties, where I would hear you -
                  dressing up what I did for a living
                  - film composer this, film composer
                  that - trying to make it more
                  palatable for your friends. I'm
                  a...
          
                            JEAN
                      (cutting him off)
                  Don't Harvey.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    What is it you see in Brian?
          
          Jean looks into Harvey's eyes. Long beat.
          
                               JEAN
                    He doesn't talk about himself.
                        (beat)
                    He talks about me.
          
          Harvey stares back, momentarily transfixed, before turning
          away dismissive.
          
                              JEAN (CONT'D)
                    Go home Harvey. Go to bed and see
                    your daughter get married tomorrow.
          
          Jean walks away. Harvey stands at the bar. Susan comes into
          the room. She approaches.
          
                               SUSAN
                    Hi Dad.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Hey Suz.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you alright?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (upbeat)
                    Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing?
                    Enjoying yourself?
          
                               SUSAN
                    Yeah.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll
                    be alright.
          
                               SUSAN
                    Yeah, he is.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry, I haven't had much time
                    to talk to you.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No Sweetheart, it's your weekend.
                    It's no problem. You just enjoy
                    yourself.
          
                                                          37.
          
          
          
          Beat.
          
                              SUSAN
                    How's work?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Great.
                        (beat)
                    Well, not great, but...fine. You
                    know the usual. Triangle chimes.
          
          Susan smiles.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you still doing your own stuff?
                    You should.
          
                              HARVEY
                    A bit... Not so much.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks away, then back.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Listen Suz, I'm really sorry about
                    having to leave early. It's just
                    bad timing. There's a sudden rush
                    at work, you know, a couple of big
                    jobs in at once.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Sure.
          
                               HARVEY
                    It just can't be helped. But I'll
                    be there at the ceremony, at the
                    really important bit. I'll be there
                    to give you away.
                        (beat)
                    And then I'm sure Brian or your
                    mother will talk at the reception.
                    You know me, I've never been very
                    good at speech...
          
                                 SUSAN
                           (interrupting)
                    Dad.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Yeah, Suz?
          
                               SUSAN
                    Listen, I've been thinking.
                        (beat)
                               (MORE)
          
                                                                  38.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     Brian has been a really big part of
                     my life now for some time. And...
                         (long beat)
                     And I'm going to ask him to give me
                     away tomorrow.
          
          Silence.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     I'm sorry, Dad.
          
          The colour drains from Harvey's ruddy face.
          
                                  HARVEY
                     But Suz...
          
                               SUSAN
                     Dad, I've hardly seen you in the
                     past five years.
          
                               HARVEY
                     That's not true.
          
                                SUSAN
                     Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee
                     here, or a telephone call there but
                     no, you haven't been part of my
                     life. And...
                         (beat)
                     And Brian has.
          
          Beat.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     You having to leave early this
                     weekend. I don't know, it just
                     seems typical.
          
                               HARVEY
                         (flash of irritation)
                     It's work darling. It pays for
                     things.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     Sorry. Look, I...
          
                               SUSAN
                         (interrupting)
                     I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've
                     decided.
          
          Harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose
          himself, before turning back.
          
                                                                     39.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    Sure.
                        (beat)
                    I understand, Suz.
          
          Harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You go and be with your friends. Go
                    and enjoy yourself.
                        (pulls out his phone)
                    I gotta make some stupid calls. You
                    know. Go and enjoy yourself,
                    Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow.
          
          Susan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his
          ear. We hold on his face. With Susan gone he lowers the
          phone. He looks frightened.
          
          
          INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He
          turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He
          splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some
          paper towels.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You fuckin' asshole!
          
          Harvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard
          in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose,
          desperately trying to hold it in. But he can't - Harvey sobs
          huge heaving muffled cries...
          
          Just then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the
          door and exits.
          
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab.
          The cab pulls away.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits surrounded by laughter. Simon's attention is firmly
          fixed on his friends. Kate's humiliation is magnified as we
          slowly move into her face.
          
                              KATE
                    Sorry.
          
                                                                    40.
          
          
          
          Kate gets up and walks away. Everyone momentarily stops
          chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs.
          
          
          INT. LADIES - NIGHT
          
          Kate enters a cubicle. She sits down to have a pee. We hold
          on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm.
          But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her
          cheek. She swats it away.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - NIGHT
          
          We hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of
          a moving cab.
          
          
          EXT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits
          one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away
          again.
          
          
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their
          vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the
          ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into
          applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his
          daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips
          out the door.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          Kate, back in green, stands next to a young couple asking
          them questions about their travel arrangements.
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          The Taxi comes to a stop in `classic' mid-day London traffic.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - DAY
          
          Harvey glances at his watch, then out at the mass of cars in
          front of them. His phone rings. He picks up.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello?
          
          The line goes dead. Harvey puts his phone away. He glances
          out the window again as the Taxi crawls forward, before again
          coming to a stop. Harvey leans forward.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Is there another way we could try?
          
          The driver, looking a little irked, glances at Harvey in his
          mirror.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    It's going to be bad everywhere.
                    Your president's in town. It's
                    causing chaos.
          
          Harvey rubs his neck and glances again at his watch.
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate eats a snack, while reading a book. Her phone suddenly
          rings. She sighs quietly before slowly picking it up.
          
                              KATE
                    Mum?
          
          
          EXT. HEATHROW / TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls up. Harvey gets out, pays the driver and hurries
          into the Terminal.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / CHECK-IN COUNTER - DAY
          
          The counter is mobbed. A long queue snakes away from it.
          Harvey hurries to the front, where a male Steward is
          attending to another passenger.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to
                    JFK.
          
                              WAITING PASSENGER
                    Hey pal, we're all in hurry.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just hand luggage, can i go
                    straight to the gate?
          
                              STEWARD
                    Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger,
                    you'll have to wait.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please. I've gotta make that
                    flight.
          
                              STEWARD
                    Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll
                    just have to wait.
          
          Harvey sees another Steward momentarily free, and turns to
          her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can
                    you check me in?
          
                              STEWARD #2
                    I'm afraid that flight's now
                    closed.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But it's not yet 4! I just have
                    hand luggage. It doesn't take off
                    for another 40 minutes.
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    I'm sorry sir, but we have to close
                    the gate 45 minutes prior to
                    departure.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But I just have hand luggage.
                    Please. I've got to get on that
                    flight.
          
                              STEWARD #2
                    I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I
                    can do.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
          
          Harvey looks around.
          
                              HARVEY
                    When's the next flight?
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    There's one at 8.30. But I     know
                    that's full. I can put you     on stand-
                    by, but I doubt you'll get     on.
                        (beat)
                    The earliest I can get you     on for
                    sure, is tomorrow morning,     10.30.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (shouts)
                    Jesus!
          
          People look over.
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    Sir, I'm sorry, but you have to
                    stay calm.
          
          Harvey looks about him.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          Harvey sits holding his phone. He dials a number, lifting the
          phone to his ear. He gets voice-mail.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen,
                    there's been a mess up, the traffic
                    was crazy. I'm going to have to
                    reschedule the pitch slightly.
                    Frank can set up. I'll email him
                    the cue numbers - he knows what to
                    do. And then I'll be there lunch-
                    time at the latest. I'll come
                    straight from the airport. I'll try
                    you again shortly.
          
          Harvey hangs up and stares at the phone. Beat. He looks up
          and around the Terminal. A young child has a tantrum nearby.
          Suddenly his phone rings.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
                              MARVIN
                    I got your message.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                     The traffic was insane. But
                     listen...
          
                               MARVIN
                         (interrupting)
                     The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!
          
          Beat. Marvin sighs.
          
                               MARVIN (CONT'D)
                     Listen, Harvey. Stay in London.
                     Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
                     We'll talk when you get back.
          
                               HARVEY
                     It's fine, I'll be there lunch-
                     time. It's no problem. Steve knows
                     what I need. Mike's coming in. It's
                     all set u...
          
                               MARVIN
                         (interrupting)
                     Harvey!
          
          Silence.
          
                                MARVIN (CONT'D)
                     It's over.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     It's out of my hands Harvey. I have
                     people to answer to. We just can't
                     afford the space.
                         (beat)
                     We're letting you go.
          
                               HARVEY
                     Letting me go? Can't afford the
                     space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch-
                     time.
          
          Beat.
          
                               MARVIN
                     I'm sorry Harvey.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     Call me when you get back.
          
          The line goes dead. Harvey closes his phone. Beat. He stares
          ahead into space, then stands and walks away.
          
                                                                   45.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate closes up the booth.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / CHEZ GERARD (BAR/RESTAURANT) - DAY
          
          Kate sits at a table near the bar, drinking a glass of wine
          and reading her book. She glances up as a man enters. Harvey
          takes a seat at the bar.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Jamesons, no ice.
          
          The Barman serves Harvey. Harvey immediately downs it.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Another.
                        (beat)
                    Please.
          
          The Barman refills his glass. Again Harvey knocks it back.
          Kate glances up from her book.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Another, please.
          
          The Barman glances at Harvey.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                 BAR MAN
                    Sorry.
          
          Harvey reaches for the now full glass. But knocks it,
          spilling it into his lap.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Shit!
          
          Kate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the
          bar. Harvey registers their gaze.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Vulgar American.
          
          Kate smiles, before returning to her book. Harvey dabs his
          trousers with some napkins.

          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                           (to himself)
                       I know, we don't raise our voices
                       in this country. It's not done.
          
          Harvey puts the sodden napkins down onto the bar. He looks at
          himself in the mirror behind the bar and rubs his chest. He
          sighs and glances around the room. He sees Kate and
          recognizes her.
          
                                  HARVEY (CONT'D)
                           (to Kate)
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Kate looks up. Beat.
          
                                    KATE
                       For what?
          
                                 HARVEY
                       For yesterday. I was rude. You
                       tried to ask me some questions.
          
          Kate nods.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                       You were just trying to do your job
                       and I was rude.
          
                                 KATE
                       I don't really remember, but I'm
                       sure you were. Most people are.
          
          Kate returns to her book. Beat.
          
                                    HARVEY
                       Good book?
          
          Kate looks up.
          
                                  KATE
                       It probably would be, if i could
                       finish it.
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (holds up his hands)
                       I get it.
          
          Beat. Harvey downs another shot. Kate looks up again.
          
                                 KATE
                       That'll help.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (looks over)
                    Sorry?
          
                              KATE
                    I said, that'll help.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Believe me, it will.
          
                              KATE
                    Right.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I reckon it'll help as much as that
                    trashy novel and a glass of
                    chardonnay.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    O-kay.
          
          Harvey winces, lowering his head into his hand. Putting some
          money onto the bar, he turns and joins Kate, taking a seat at
          an adjacent table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm really sorry. That was out of
                    line.
          
                              KATE
                        (looks up)
                    What? Go away and stop apologizing.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's just that i've had a really
                    shitty day.
          
                              KATE
                        (looking back at her book)
                    Join the club.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I mean really shitty. Yours may
                    have been shitty, but mine was
                    shittier.
          
          Beat. Finally, Kate looks up again at this strange man.
          
                                                               48.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    How shitty?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I missed my flight. I lost my job.
                    And my daughter who got married in
                    London today asked her step father
                    rather than me to give her away.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment.
          
                               KATE
                    Not bad.
                        (beat)
                    But what can I do for you?
                        (beat)
                    Make it worse, maybe?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Let me make it up to you.
                        (beat)
                    Would you let me buy you lunch.
                    What time is it - tea time? I'll
                    buy you tea.
          
          Kate blushes ever so slightly.
          
                              KATE
                    That's very sweet of you, but... I
                    don't know you. And... you don't
                    know me.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Exactly. That's why we should have
                    lunch - tea.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Thank you, but...no.
          
          She indicates her book.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Because you've got your book. And
                    it's a good replacement for humans.
          
          Kate smiles and nods. Just then her phone rings.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    If that's for me I'm in the shower.
          
                                                                    49.
          
          
          
          Kate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the
          incoming number. She is about to answer, when she stops
          herself.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Aren't you going to answer that?
          
          She thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back.
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Should I take that as a hopeful
                    sign.
          
          Kate can't help but smile.
          
                              KATE
                    If it is, you could just give me a
                    little wider smile.
          
          Kate can't help but smile wider.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Kate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by
          the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing
          back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now
          sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly
          bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body
          bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he
          carries it into the shed. Kate's mum turns away ashen.
          
          
          INT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables. Muzak plays
          in the background. They are now virtually the sole patrons of
          Chez Gerard. Kate eats a salad and reads her book. Just then,
          Harvey's food arrives. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Look we are having lunch together.
          
                              KATE
                        (looks up and smiles)
                    No. We're having lunch next to each
                    other.
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Ah.
                        (beat/suddenly holds out
                         his hand)
                    I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.
          
                              KATE
                        (takes it)
                    Kate. Kate Walker.
          
          Kate can't help but smile at Harvey's persistence. Beat. She
          puts down her book.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So why aren't you at the wedding?
          
          Harvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's
          question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum
          cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner
          vacuuming the floor nearby.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ah, that's better. I knew something
                    was missing.
                        (shouting over the din)
                    I had to get back for a work thing.
          
                              KATE
                        (over the din)
                    A work thing. For the job you just
                    lost?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (over din)
                    Yes.
          
                               KATE
                        (over din)
                    I see.
                        (beat)
                    So, this job you lost. You liked
                    it?
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (over din)
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    No. Not really. They've beaten it
                    out of me. But its what i do - did.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                        (over din)
                    Which is - was?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (shouts)
                    I'm a composer.
                        (stops himself)
                    I write jingles.
          
          The vacuuming stops. They both look over, then back.
          
                                 KATE
                    Wow.
          
                              HARVEY
                    That's about the normal response.
          
                              KATE
                    Anything I would of heard?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yes. Uh...Uh...
                        (long beat)
                    Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before
                    your time.
          
                               KATE
                        (smiles)
                    No, go on.
          
          Harvey smiles a little sheepishly.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (singsong voice)
                    You can take the Salem out of the
                    country - but you can't take the
                    country out of Salem.
          
          Beat.
          
                                 KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's a cigarette.
          
                                 KATE
                    Oh really?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Forget it.
          
                                                                     52.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    Ok.
          
          The vacuuming starts up again. They look over then back.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                        (over din)
                    Did you always want to write
                    jingles or was there something
                    more?
          
          Harvey laughs.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, I just love the way you...you
                    just cut through it.
          
                              KATE
                    I'll take that as a compliment.
          
                               HARVEY
                    You should.
                        (beat)
                    I was going to be a Jazz pianist.
          
                              KATE
                    Were you good?
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. Not enough.
          
          Harvey looks away.
          
                              KATE
                    I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend
                    to blurt stuff out.
          
          Breaking from his reverie.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I like it. I like it...
                        (beat/over din)
                    ...Alot.
          
          Vacuuming stops. Beat. Kate looks away.
          
                                                          53.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    It's a relief to find someone in
                    this country who actually says what
                    they feel.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, haven't you heard?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    What?
          
                               KATE
                    That's all changed. We're a nation
                    changed. Ever since Diana, we've
                    unlocked ourselves. Everything's
                    flowing out.
                        (beat)
                    You guys showed us the way.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just as we're trying to adopt your
                    stiff upper lip.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What is a stiff upper lip, exactly?
          
          Harvey tries to physicalize it.
          
                              KATE
                    No, I think, it's more this.
          
          Kate stretches her top lip.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I see.
                        (copies her)
                    How's that?
          
                              KATE
                        (top lip stretched)
                    Yeah you're getting there. Stretch
                    it out further.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Let me see again.
          
                              KATE
                    No, now you're doing a bulldog.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Like this?
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    No, now you look like you don't
                    have any teeth.
                        (beat)
                    Are they your own?
          
                               HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    Your teeth?
          
                              HARVEY
                    The front ones.
          
                              KATE
                    My dad had a front one that you
                    could just take out.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Really?
          
          As they sit there, lips stretched, nattering away, we start
          to pull back. Accompanied by a simple piano score we look on
          as they appear to us, momentarily, like an ordinary couple.
          
          
          EXT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each
          other in the quietening Terminal.
          
                              KATE
                    Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. So did I.
          
          Slightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch.
          
                              KATE
                    I should get going. I have a class.
          
                               HARVEY
                    A class?
          
                               KATE
                        (a bit sheepish)
                    Yes. A...writing class.
                        (beat)
                    Twice a week. Just something I do.

                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I take the Heathrow Express. What
                    about you?
          
          Harvey hadn't really thought.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I don't know. I guess I'll stay in
                    a Hotel near here. My flight's in
                    the morning.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Well...it's been a
                    pleasure...Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. Yes it has.
          
          They shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate's phone rings
          again.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    There's your phone again.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry. I'd better go.
          
          Kate turns and leaves. Harvey watches her go.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL / HOTEL PHONE BANK - DAY
          
          Harvey picks up a hotel phone.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'd like a room please.
                        (beat)
                    One night.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW EXPRESS PLATFORM - DAY
          
          Kate waits on the platform as a train glides into the
          station.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Kate stands in a crowded middle section. A mild commotion
          ensues down the other end of the carriage as somebody
          squeezes aboard at the last.
          
                                                                     56.
          
          
          
                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sorry. Excuse me.
          
          Kate looks up to see Harvey making his way down the crowded
          carriage.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Sorry.
          
          People reluctantly make way for Harvey and his case. He
          finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward.
          
          Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a
          businessman's shoulder. Kate leans forward to help, as the
          businessman turns slightly irritated.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
                        (turning to Kate)
                    Hi.
                        (a little sheepish)
                    I thought i might as well stay in
                    town. More fun than a hotel next to
                    a runway, right?
          
          Kate nods. Harvey smiles a little sheepishly as the train
          speeds off.
          
          
          EXT. TRACK - DAY
          
          The train speeds past on its way into London.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate stand next to each other, gently swaying, in
          the crowded carriage. The businessman standing next to
          Harvey, talks loudly on his phone about his day's conquest.
          Harvey and Kate share a look. In a Keatonesque performance,
          Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and
          further away from the man, making Kate smile.
          
          
          INT. PADDINGTON STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The train pulls into the station. We watch as Harvey and Kate
          alight with the crowd.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. PADDINGTON STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          They come to a stop outside. It's still light. A beautiful
          fall afternoon.
          
                              KATE
                    Taxi's are over there. They'll take
                    you to wherever you need to go.
          
          Harvey looks towards the Taxi rank.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So, I guess it's goodbye again.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Yes.
                        (looks up at the evening
                         sky/beat)
                    So, I couldn't walk you to your
                    class, could I?

                    Stand near the curb so you don't
                    get splashed.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                                 KATE
                    Sure.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Is that a yes?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    Why not?
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty,
          we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the
          buzzing streets of central London. All is alive and well.
          
          Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was
          staying in before.
          
          As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle,
          policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its
          best.
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk
          along the South Bank.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    Its just a funny way of saying it.
                    Quite old fashioned.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Really?
          
                               KATE
                    But i like it.

                    Yours is glorious country,
                    Honeychurch.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate quizzically.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    It's a line from a book. `Room with
                    a View'.
          
          Harvey shakes his head.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'm afraid I'm not much of a
                    reader.
                        (beat)
                    Too fidgety, I guess.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You think less of me.
          
                              KATE
                    No, we're just quite different,
                    that's all.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Is that bad?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                           (thinks about it)
                    No.
          
          Just then Kate's phone rings again.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Both our phones ring a lot. We have
                    that in common.
          
                                 KATE
                           (smiles)
                    Ah.
          
          They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at
          the handset display.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I should probably take this.
          
          Harvey nods.
          
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                    Mum?
                         (beat)
                    I've been busy.
                         (beat)
                    No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No
                    someone else.
                         (beat)
                    Yes.
                         (looks at Harvey)
                    ...a man.
          
          Harvey smiles. We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate
          listens. Beat.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    You did, did you?
                        (beat)
                    An actual body.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    Mum. Listen. I'll come over
                    tomorrow and we can check it out
                    together.
                        (beat)
                    I have to go now. Just get an early
                    night and i'll see you tomorrow.
                        (beat)
                    I love you too.
          
                                                          60.
          
          
          
          Kate hangs up.
          
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
                        (beat)
                    My mother.
          
                              HARVEY
                    She worries about you?
          
                               KATE
                    And herself.
                        (beat)
                    She's convinced she's living next
                    to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I see.
          
          They start walking again.
          
                               KATE
                    She means well. She's just had a
                    tough run.
                        (long beat)
                    My Father ran off to France with
                    his secretary. Then mum got cancer,
                    about four years ago now. She's
                    fully recovered. But won't admit
                    it.
                        (beat)
                    She's basically bored. And my
                    continued `situation' as she calls
                    it, being single, is her major
                    distraction. Her pastime if you
                    will.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I see.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison
                    d'être.
                        (grimaces/turns to Harvey)
                    Sorry.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    No.
          
                              KATE
                    I talk too much.
          
                                                          61.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I like it.
          
                                KATE
                    Do you?
          
                                HARVEY
                    Yes.
          
          Kate comes to a stop and looks at Harvey.
          
                                KATE
                    Hmm.
                        (beat)
                    Well, here we are. My class.
          
          Harvey looks up at a grey municipal building.
          
                              HARVEY
                    How long is the class?
          
                                KATE
                    An hour.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Can I wait?
                        (beat)
                    Sorry - I promise I'm not
                    `Bundyish'.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiles)
                    It's getting cold. You don't want
                    to wait.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Yes I do.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling and backing
                         towards the building)
                    Careful, I might get the wrong
                    impression.
          
          Harvey shrugs.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What can you do?
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Maggie, very tentatively, lifts her curtain again. No sign of
          the `Killer'. Suddenly the doorbell rings.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          As Maggie, slowly approaches the front door, the doorbell
          rings again. She slowly leans in and peers through the peep-
          hole. POV: The Neighbour looms large. He holds in his arms a
          large `something' wrapped in paper.
          
          Maggie pulls her head away. Beat. She looks again. POV: The
          Neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again,
          turning to leave. Maggie watches him go.
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The door slowly opens. Maggie looks around then notices the
          `thing' wrapped in paper on the ground. She quickly picks it
          up and takes it inside.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting. Through a large
          ground floor window, he watches Kate, as her class wraps up.
          As she comes out, he gets up and joins her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    How did it go?
          
                               KATE
                    Oh, the usual.
                        (beat)
                    Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us
                    the latest installment from his
                    Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all
                    tried to look at him in the same
                    way after.
          
          Harvey smiles.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Shall we keep walking?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second
          hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically.
          
                               KATE
                    Do you ever wish you could try a
                    different life?
                        (beat)
                    Just for a day. Just to see what it
                    would be like.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What would yours be?
          
                              KATE
                        (looks down at her
                         uniform)
                    Well, no green, that's for sure.
          
          Harvey smiles.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                        (beat/thinks)
                    It would take place in Spain. A
                    little house inland.
          
                              HARVEY
                    And what would you do there?
          
                               KATE
                    Oh...I don't know...

                    Write the great novel.
                        (beat)
                    I think I've got one inside me.
                    We're not talking high art. Just a
                    bloody good holiday read.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ok. So this house in Spain would
                    have a little cabana looking out
                    over the plains for you to write
                    in.
          
                                 KATE
                           (smiling)
                    Yes.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    And a little stream running by, to
                    bathe in.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling)
                    Sure.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'm there.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry, that's if you're receiving
                    guests.
          
          Kate smiles, coming to a stop.
          
                              KATE
                    Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Why, thank you Kate Walker.
          
          Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act
          starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and
          Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at
          its vibrant best.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK
          
          With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the
          distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps
          over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps
          reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then...
          
                               KATE
                    What happened Harvey?
                        (beat)
                    Between you and your daughter?
          
          Beat. Harvey shakes his head.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I don't know.
                        (beat)
                    Somewhere along the way I lost her.
                    I lost my family.
                        (beat)
                    I just woke up one morning and
                    realised i didn't belong.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I'd always had this mean little
                    feeling in my stomach, that they
                    were a bit embarrassed by me.
                        (beat)
                    If you saw them now, with Brian,
                    Susan's step-father. You'd see,
                    they make more sense. They look
                    right together.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks out over the Thames.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I've not been a great father.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a
          moment.
          
                              KATE
                    The reception. It's still going on?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (looks at his watch)
                    I guess.
          
                              KATE
                    Where?
          
          Harvey looks up.
          
                              HARVEY
                    The Grovesnor. Why?
          
          Kate looks at Harvey.
          
                              KATE
                    You must go.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    What the hell are you doing here?
                    You must go!
          
          Harvey shakes his head.
          
                              HARVEY
                    She doesn't need me.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
                    She's your daughter, you're her
                    father. Go!
          
          Harvey shakes his head again. Kate is not about to give up.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    Harvey, it would be unforgivable
                    not to go.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Harvey?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Wait. I'm thinking.
                        (beat)
                    Only if you come with me.
          
                              KATE
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please, come with me. As
                    my...bodyguard.
                        (smiles)
                    As my friend.
          
          Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head.
          
                               KATE
                    Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to
                    go to anyone's wedding in a green
                    polyester work suit. Secondly it's
                    not right.
          
                              HARVEY
                    We'll find you a dress. If we find
                    you a dress, will you come?
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please.
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    No.
          
          
          EXT. BURLINGTON ARCADE - NIGHT
          
          Music/Montage: The song is the same as that played by the
          buskers. It's a fast, fun Rockabilly Skiffle thingy. We watch
          as Harvey and Kate buy a dress. (Handheld/Double speed).
          
          
          EXT. GROVESNOR - NIGHT
          
          A Taxi pulls up and out step Harvey and Kate. Kate looks
          fantastic on Harvey's arm as they walk up the front steps.
          
          
          INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          A reception is in full swing.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
          
          The doors close behind Harvey and Kate as they enter an
          elevator.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
          
          Harvey and Kate stand side by side in silence. They both
          smile a little anxiously - almost like teenagers.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION FLOOR / HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          There is a loud `ping' as the   elevator doors open onto a
          hallway. Harvey and Kate step   forward. Down the hall, through
          some double doors we hear the   familiar din of a buzzing
          reception. Harvey momentarily   falters.
          
                               KATE
                    Come on.
          
          Kate encourages Harvey forward.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          The doors open and Harvey and Kate enter. Heads turn. Jean
          looks up and sees Harvey with Kate. She shakes her head.
          Susan sees Harvey and gets up. She joins him.
          
                                                          68.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Hey.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Hi.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I didn't go.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    I'm glad.
          
          Off Susan's look, Harvey turns to Kate.
          
                              HARVEY
                    This is Kate. A... friend.
          
                               KATE
                        (sheepish)
                    Hi. Congratulations. You look
                    fantastic.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              KATE
                    I'm really sorry to gate-crash.
                    Your father sort of insisted.
          
                              SUSAN
                    No, it's fine. I'm sure...
                        (looks around)
                    ...there's room.
          
          Susan looks back at the full top table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You get back. Don't worry about us,
                    we'll find a place.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes...
          
                                 SUSAN
                    No.
                        (stops a passing waiter)
                    Could you find them a seat please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Sure.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          
          Pete, acting as Master of Ceremonies, stands and clinks his
          glass for attention.
          
                              SUSAN
                    I'd better go.
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    And now for the best man's speech.
                    Except we seem to be missing the
                    bride.
                        (laughter)
                    Oh, no, here she is.
          
          Susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table. The best
          man takes the mic...
          
                              JOSH
                    Scott. What can I say...
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BACK TABLES
          
          The waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table.
          
                              WAITER
                    I'm afraid this is the only place
                    left.
          
          The waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children's
          table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    That's fine.
          
          Harvey and Kate take their seats. The kids stare at them.
          
                              KATE
                    Hi.
          
          A brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks.
          
                              GIRL
                    Are you Uncle Harvey?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. I guess.
          
                              GIRL
                    I've heard about you.
          
                                                                  70.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oh.
                        (beat)
                    You're not Miriam's kid are you?
          
                              GIRL
                    Yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Wow...You've...got big. I mean
                    grown up.
          
                              GIRL
                    I'm fourteen.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Wow.
          
          Kate feels someone's eyes on her and turns to her left to
          find a smartly dressed young boy of about eight, staring up
          at her with his mouth open. Kate nods her head.
          
                              KATE
                    Hello.
          
          The boy remains silent, keeping his gormless gaze fixed on
          Kate.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Now you're not to dominate the
                    conversation tonight.
                        (turning back to Harvey)
                    Chatterbox to my left.
          
          Harvey smiles.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / TOP TABLE - NIGHT
          
                              JOSH
                    So without further ado, I'd like to
                    propose a toast to Susan for making
                    my friend Scott complete.
          
          The audience whoop and clap. Scott gives his best man a hug.
          Pete stands...
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    And now ladies and Gentlemen. It is
                    the turn of the Father of the Bride
                    to say a few words.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  71.
          
                              PETE (MC) (CONT'D)
                    And tonight that task will be
                    carried out by the very charming
                    and distinguished Brian.
          
          More clapping as Brian stands. Kate glances at Harvey, who
          blushes.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Well, that's quite some speech
                    Josh. Quite something to follow.
                    But I shall try...
          
          Harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Um... Excuse me...
          
          Nobody really hears. He picks up his glass and a spoon and
          begins to tap it. People stir and turn to Harvey. Brian comes
          to a stop. Jean looks on furious. Silence.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.
          
          Everyone stares at Harvey. Silence.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    But you see I can't just sit hear
                    and watch somebody else give my
                    baby girl away. Susan's my daughter
                    and I'm her father. Not the best,
                    by far, but her father all the
                    same.
          
          A waiter brings Harvey a microphone.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.
          
          It's arrival slightly throws him.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Um... I should have prepared
                    something but... I guess it reminds
                    me of a joke...
          
          Harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest, causing
          terrible feedback.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Um...
          
          Then Harvey drops the mic. Jean stands up.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
                                JEAN
                      For God's sake Harvey, don't make a
                      scene.
          
          Silence. Harvey stares out at the party. They all stare back
          at him. He glances down at Kate who smiles back. Harvey lifts
          the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.
          
                                 HARVEY
                      No Jean. I want to make a scene.
                      You know. I'm tired of being
                      embarrassed.
                          (beat)
                      If we can't make a scene on the day
                      of our daughter's wedding, then
                      when can we? I want to make a
                      scene. I want to shout! I wanna
                      tell the world how lucky it is to
                      have our Suzie in it!
          
                                SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
                      Yeah!
          
                                HARVEY
                      I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky
                      he is!
          
                                UNCLE FRED
                      Hear, hear!
          
          People start to clap.
          
                                HARVEY
                          (smiling)
                      And also if he ever hurts her, I
                      know people in north of London.
          
          Laughter.
          
                                HARVEY (CONT'D)
                      Seriously though. Scott, I swear
                      you have found in Susan a bright
                      and passionate person. And a loyal
                      friend.
          
                                CONGREGATION
                      Hear, hear!
          
                                 HARVEY
                      And I can see from the way she
                      looks at you. From the way she is
                      with you, that she is...
                          (beat)
                                 (MORE)
          
                                                                     73.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    ...happy.
                        (beat)
                    And I thank you and welcome you to
                    the family.
          
          Harvey and Scott share a look. The room applauds loudly.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    And finally, if I can linger a
                    moment longer. I would like to turn
                    it back over to Brian, with a note
                    of... gratitude.
                        (beat)
                    Thank you for being there for my
                    baby girl. Thank you for being
                    there, when I wasn't.
          
          Beat. Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his
          glass.
          
                               BRIAN
                    If you would all please join Harvey
                    and I, in a toast.
                        (beat)
                    To Susan and Scott.
          
                              CONGREGATION
                    Susan and Scott!
          
          Everyone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her
          Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles
          and nods.
          
                                 KATE
                    Well done.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Really?
          
          She indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their
          now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, the first
                    dance.
          
          The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance
          floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
          
          After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey
          hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower
          from the table display and places it in his lapel.
          
          Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking
          Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Thanks for coming back Dad.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thanks for having me back.
          
          Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter.
          Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's
          head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate
          smiles at her lot.
          
          Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over
          the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by
          Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred
          pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes
          up.
          
          Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended
          family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at
          all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family
          celebrate alone.
          
          Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two
          chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a
          jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to
          leave.
          
          Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey
          caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie
          around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to
          look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing
          children.
          
          Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate
          amongst the crowded room.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall
          towards the bank of elevators.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          Harvey hurries to the exit.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the
          distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight.
          Harvey runs.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to
          close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a
          piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across
          the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a
          grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it
          another `old school' burst.
          
          He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to
          close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening
          them.
          
          Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something
          sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out
          of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the
          piano.
          
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join
          him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully.
          He's good.
          
          He finally brings the piece to an end.
          
                                 KATE
                    Wow.
          
          Harvey blushes.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    One of yours?
          
          Harvey smiles at Kate.
          
                                                         76.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    You are very kind. But...no.
                        (beat)
                    Shearing doing Rogers.
          
                              KATE
                    Ah.
                        (beat)
                    Well...you play it very well.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (bows his head a
                         little/with a smile)
                    Well, thank you Ms. Walker.
          
                              KATE
                    You're most welcome, Mr Shine.
          
          They share a little smile. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Me thinks you were leaving?
          
                              KATE
                    Indeed I was, Sire.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Why?
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Because you looked happy.
          
          Harvey looks quizzically at Kate. Beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    You should be with your family,
                    Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But, you know, maybe I want to be
                    with you.
                        (beat/sings)
                    You make me happy - when skies are
                    grey.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              KATE
                    Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Thank you.
          
                                 KATE
                    For what?
          
                              HARVEY
                    For making me come here.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    You're welcome.
          
          They share a look, before both looking away. Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Can I?
          
                                 KATE
                    What?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Can I...?
          
          Just then a vacuum cleaner sounds. They both look up - as a
          cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hey kid, they're playing our song.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
          
          In the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from
          the reception. A funky number starts up. Harvey takes Kate's
          hand.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (excited)
                    Come on. I want you to meet people.
                    I want them to meet you.
          
          Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall
          towards the reception.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          The band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the
          dance-floor.
          
                                                                  78.
          
          
          Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for
          the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey
          introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and kissing ensues.
          
          Harvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie
          join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her
          off.
          
          MONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the
          center of it all. He initiates a Horah. A Congo line. Russian
          dancing! Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball. The
          sleeping kid, sleeps.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT
          
          Close up on the M.C.
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and
                    groom are about to leave. Please
                    join me outside to send them off in
                    style.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT
          
          Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on
          the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and
          son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws
          the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in
          turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up'
          niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of
          braces on her teenage teeth.
          
          Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to
          get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Bye Dad.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
          
          She hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Be gentle with him.
          
          Kate nods as Susan turns to leave.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (to Kate)
                    Sorry.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          
          Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone   cheers. Harvey
          looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his   ex-wife's. They
          share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches   his daughter's
          car disappear down the street, Kate looks at   him. He turns
          back. Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    You Ok?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. Yes, I am.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks around.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You wanna get out of here?
          
                              KATE
                    Sure.
          
          
          EXT. MEWS STREET - NIGHT/DAWN
          
          Harvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already
          a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAWN
          
          They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a
          seat on some chairs. The sky lightens.
          
                              KATE
                    I don't think I've stayed up all
                    night since I was a student.
          
          They stare out over the courtyard. Silence. Harvey looks at
          Kate for a beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You got sad. Why?
          
          Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him. She looks
          down at her lap, then up, out over the courtyard.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, I don't know. My uniform's
                    green?
          
          The sun begins to creep above the buildings. Harvey and Kate
          look out across the courtyard.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I was pregnant once.
                        (beat)
                    I didn't have it. Didn't give it a
                    moment's thought.
                        (beat)
                    That's what smart girls did.
          
          Beat.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I do sometimes wonder what they'd
                    be like today.
                        (beat)
                    Whether they'd be smart. Funny.
                    Serious.
                        (beat)
                    I don't know, it's silly.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate in the morning light. Kate blushes and
          looks away.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I don't know why i just told you
                    that.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    I'm glad.
          
          Harvey looks away, then back.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Meet me here, tomorrow.
          
                                 KATE
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Exactly here, at these chairs. At
                    noon.
          
          Kate smiles, determinedly trying to keep it light.
          
                              KATE
                    What about your flight, Harvey?
          
                               HARVEY
                    I don't want to leave.
                        (beat)
                    Guess why.
          
                                                                     81.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                    Why?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I wanna be with you.
          
          Kate's blush deepens, she looks away and laughs.
          
                              KATE
                    Shut up, Harvey.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    It's true.
          
          Kate glances at Harvey, trying see the truth in his eyes.
          
                              KATE
                    You say that now, but wait until
                    tomorrow.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Today is tomorrow.
          
                              KATE
                    Harvey we know nothing about each
                    other. You're...
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Old?
          
                               KATE
                    A bit older, yes.
                        (beat)
                    I can be mean. Really mean.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    So can I.
          
                              KATE
                    No. Truly cantankerous.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    So can I.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat. She glances towards the
          street.
          
                              KATE
                        (standing)
                    I should be going.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I know enough to know, I'll be
                    here. Waiting, at this chair.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street.
          
                              KATE
                    Sure, Harvey.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Noon. I mean it.
                        (beat)
                    I'll be here.
          
          Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him.
          
                                 KATE
                    Ok.
          
          She steps backwards.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Wait.
          
          Harvey gets up and joins her. They look at each other. Harvey
          suddenly leans in and kisses Kate.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (pulling away/can't help
                         smiling)
                    Sorry.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              KATE
                    Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Can I have something until
                    tomorrow.
          
          Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives
          it to Harvey.
          
                               KATE
                        (stepping backwards)
                    I must go.
          
          She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus.
          
          Harvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On
          it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than
          eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles.
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING
          
          Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus. Taking a moment
          to catch her breath, she looks out the window. Turning back,
          she allows herself a smile...
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREET - EARLY MORNING
          
          Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of
          coffee in hand, buys a morning paper. He turns and crosses
          the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING
          
          Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge,
          heads to the bank of elevators.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Morning.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    I'm afraid they're both out of
                    order, Sir.
          
          Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I guess i'll walk, then.
          
          
          INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING
          
          Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life',
          runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he
          begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his
          spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey
          sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to
          stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his
          coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders,
          grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the
          steps.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Shit.
          
          Frightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell.
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
          Just then, a door opens and the African porter from before,
          comes through, carrying a tray. He sees Harvey.
          
                              PORTER
                    Sir, are you Ok?
          
          Harvey looks up in a daze, then shakes his head.
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREET - MORNING
          
          Kate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid-
          day streets of London. She stops off and buys a bag of
          cherries from a `Fruit & Veg' vendor.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
          
          As the porter and concierge talk to a medic, Harvey sits in
          the back of an ambulance. The door is closed.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate sits waiting, expectantly, on the same chairs they had
          sat on earlier. She applies some lipstick.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Harvey sits attached to various monitors and such, surrounded
          by doctors and nurses. He looks agitated and confused.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I've got to go. I've got to be
                    somewhere.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Sir, I need you to stay calm. It
                    looks to me like Arrhythmia - an
                    irregular heart-beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been
                    trying to tell the nurse. I've had
                    it since I was a kid. I take
                    Primax. I guess i've been
                    forgetting to take it recently.
                    I've been under alot of stress,
                    that's all.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Well Ok, then we probably know
                    where we're at. But I need to check
                    all possibilities.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          As time passes, we watch as Kate's expression slowly turns
          from expectant to resigned.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
                               HARVEY
                    I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I
                    have to be there.
          
                               DOCTOR
                    Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job
                    is to make sure it's not that 1%. I
                    wouldn't be doing my job if I
                    didn't check out absolutely
                    everything.
                        (beat)
                    Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by
                    Bloods. And can you arranfe a
                    monitored bed for him for tonight.
          
          As another pad is attached to his chest, Harvey looks beaten.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby. She
          self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at
          her watch. Beat. She looks down at the brown paper bag of
          cherries. Suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face -
          she's been here before ­ nothing new.
          
          Kate gets up and leaves. We watch her walk away.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          Sound of a vacuum cleaner.
          
                                                              FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Open on a close up of Kate's face - it says it all. Kate
          vacuums her mother's floor. She turns it off and unplugs it.
          
                                                                     86.
          
          
          Coiling up the cord, Kate puts the vacuum cleaner into a
          cupboard under the stairs.
          
                              KATE
                        (calling out)
                    Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.
          
          Maggie comes out of the kitchen.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Why don't you stay and have some
                    lunch?
          
                               KATE
                    I can't, I've got to go.
                        (beat)
                    Not to pry or anything but why is
                    there a large smoked ham under the
                    stairs?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The
                    neighbour gave it to me.
          
                               KATE
                    The polish neighbour?
                        (beat)
                    So probably not a mass murderer.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Probably not.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    Are you sure you're going to be
                    alright?
          
                              KATE
                    Of course I will. I'll be fine.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Men, who needs them. Remember we've
                    got Greece to look forward to.
          
          Resigned, Kate hugs her mum.
          
                              KATE
                    Yeah.
          
          Kate leaves.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate exits her mother's house and passes Paddy the Postman.
          
                              PADDY
                    Morning Kate.
          
                              KATE
                    Morning Paddy.
          
                              PADDY
                    Looking lovely as ever.
          
                               KATE
                        (resigned)
                    Thank you.
          
          Kate walks off down the street.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey stands at a counter in a busy reception area. He has
          his phone lodged in the crook of his neck. In front of him,
          lies an open phone directory.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's some sort of Statistics
                    Agency.
                        (listens)
                    Yes. That sounds right. Yes, based
                    out at Heathrow.
                        (listens)
                    Thank you. Hold on.
                        (turns to a receptionist)
                    Miss, could I borrow, your pen.
          
          The receptionist obliges as Harvey scribbles down a number on
          an old envelope.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks, thanks alot.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          A phone rings behind the counter. Oonagh picks up.
          
                               OONAGH
                    O.N.S., Heathrow branch.
                        (beat)
                    Hold on.

                                                                    88.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (calling out)
                    Kate it's for you. Some guy called
                    Harvey.
          
          Kate, stands nearby, holding a clipboard, about to head out
          onto the floor. She looks at Oonagh. She thinks for a beat,
          then shakes her head, silently gesturing she not there.
          Oonagh, a little perplexed goes back on the phone.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Um, I'm sorry. She's not here.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey, phone to ear, thinks for a beat. He knows she's
          there.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please. It's important.
          
          Beat.
          
                                 OONAGH
                    Hold on.
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Oonagh pulls the phone away and gestures again to Kate. Kate
          shakes her head. Beat. Oonagh reluctantly lifts the phone to
          her ear.
          
                               OONAGH
                    I'm sorry, she's busy.
                        (beat)
                    She won't come.
          
          Oonagh hangs up, looking at Kate. Kate shrugs defensively
          before turning to go. We hold on Kate's `confused' face as
          she walks away.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey, having hung up, lowers the phone from his ear. He
          looks around the room. Seated across the way an old man
          stares back at him. A receptionist arrives with some forms.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    If I could just get you to sign
                    these, you'll be all done.
          
          Harvey signs a form.
          
                                                                  89.
          
          
          
                               RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                    And there.
                        (beat)
                    And that's it.
          
          Harvey glances at the receptionist - she is roughly Kate's
          age. Just then his phone rings. He picks up hopefully.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Hey Harvey, it's Marvin. Where are
                    you?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (turns from the counter)
                    Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.
          
                               MARVIN
                    Well you get yourself back here my
                    friend. I've got some great news.
                    You were right. The Samuelson
                    account. None of the kids could
                    handle it. They couldn't nail it.
                    They ended up picking one of your
                    old tunes. They want you to come
                    back and update it.
                        (beat)
                    We need you back, Harvey. Your old
                    room's here waiting for you.
                        (beat)
                    Harvey?
          
          Harvey looks around the room at the lonely figures, waiting.
          A young boy fidgets. Next to him sits a young man, lost in
          thought.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, that's great Marvin.
          
                               MARVIN
                    Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean,
                    look, I know when to eat humble
                    pie. So look, hey, when can you get
                    back here?
                        (beat)
                    Harvey?
          
          Harvey glances back at the old man. The old man continues to
          stare back. Beat. Something changes in Harvey.
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I...I'm not coming back.
          
                                MARVIN
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm quitting Marvin.
          
                              MARVIN
                    What you mean you quit? Harvey,
                    fuck you man, you need us.
          
                               HARVEY
                    No, you know, I don't. As you said,
                    it's my `last chance'.
                        (beat)
                    Look, I gotta go.
          
          Harvey hangs up. A smile breaks across his face.
          
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Harvey exits the Hospital.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (calling out)
                    Taxi!
          
          A taxi pulls up.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Heathrow please. As quick as you
                    can.
          
          Harvey gets in as the Taxi speeds away.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Aggie, manning the booth, attends to some passengers.
          
          
          EXT. HEATHROW - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls up. Harvey hurries out.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Harvey approaches the booth.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Excuse me, I'm looking for a Kate.
                    Kate Walker.
          
          Aggie eyes Harvey, a little warily.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Who wants to know?
          
                               HARVEY
                    A friend.
                        (beat)
                    More than a friend.
          
          Aggie tuts and calls behind her.
          
                              AGGIE
                    There's a man here looking for
                    Kate, says he's `more than a
                    friend.'
          
                              OONAGH (O.S.)
                    More than a friend?!
          
          Oonagh comes out from the office, eyeing Harvey suspiciously.
          
                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    You're the American.
                        (long beat)
                    She likes you. I can tell.
                        (beat)
                    Now, don't you go messing her
                    around. Don't you hurt her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I wouldn't. I won't.
          
          Beat. Oonagh continues to eye Harvey. Finally...
          
                              OONAGH
                    She's not here.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oh.
          
                               OONAGH
                    She's left for the day.
                        (beat)
                    But you might find her at her
                    class.
                        (looks at her watch)
                    I think it starts around now. Down
                    on the Southbank. At the National.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes, I know.
          
                               OONAGH
                    Oh you do, do you?
                        (beat)
                    Well, go on. Go get her.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Thank you.
          
          Harvey turns and hurries away. Oonagh and Aggie share a
          smile.
          
          
          INT. WRITING CLASS - DAY
          
                              MIKE
                    The blood oozes from his wound like
                    dark chocolate on a warm summer's
                    day.
          
          Kate sits listening in a daze, as `mild-mannered Mike'
          unleashes his latest.
          
          
          EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Harvey alights from the Taxi, paying the driver. He runs.
          
          
          INT. CLASS - DAY
          
          Everyone gathers their things as the class wraps.
          
          
          EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Harvey hurries towards the Southbank.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTHBANK - DAY
          
          Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National,
          saying her good-byes to her classmates. In her hand she holds
          a book. As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the
          distance. She momentarily falters before approaching.
          
                                 KATE
                    Hey.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Hey.
          
                                                           93.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    You're still here - still in
                    London...
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yeah.
                        (beat)
                    Kate, I just wanted to apologise
                    and explain...
          
                              KATE
                    No, you don't have to - explain -
                    it's fine -
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, but I do -
          
                               KATE
                    I don't need to hear - it's fine,
                    seriously.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But I want to...
                        (comes out)
                    I had to go to Hospital.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, God! Why?!
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just
                    forgot to take my pills. I have
                    this condition, I've had it since I
                    was a kid - it's an irregular heart-
                    beat sort of thing.
          
                                 KATE
                    Arrythmia.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes! How do you know what it is?
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling a little
                         sheepish)
                    My...My father has it.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (smiling)
                    Well, young men get it too.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                    Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
          
          Beat. Kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical
          response she's gone over in her head.
          
                                KATE
                    Harvey, I like you, I really do.
                    And I had a lovely time - it was
                    great. But, you know, I don't
                    really do fountains at noon.
                         (beat)
                    I live in Willesden. And you live -
                    in -
          
                              HARVEY
                    White Plains.
          
                              KATE
                    Exactly. And we're not teenagers,
                    so - you know, monday morning and
                    life kicks in, all that jobs and
                    family and brown envelopes with
                    bills in - it was a lovely day and
                    I won't forget it, but it's not
                    exactly real life...
          
                              HARVEY
                    It is. It can be.
          
                              KATE
                    No, Harvey, it's not.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Kate, I want this. I want you.
          
          A button is pushed in Kate.
          
                               KATE
                    But it's not just about you, is it?
                        (beat)
                    You don't know anything about me.
                    Look at me. It's pathetic. I
                    expected you not to show for God's
                    sake. I think I even wanted you not
                    to be there, it's easier that way.
                        (beat)
                    You - you just dive in wherever,
                    deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your
                    bloody swimming pool Harvey.
                        (starting to break)
                               (MORE)
          
                                                                  95.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    And I am not going to do it, I'm
                    not going to do it because it will
                    hurt. Not right now, maybe, but
                    soon - there will be a "it's not
                    quite working is it" or a "I need
                    some space" or whatever it is and
                    it'll end and it'll hurt and I
                    won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh
                    fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't
                    want this...
          
          Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade,
          looking down at the river below. Harvey watches. She takes a
          seat on a bench. Harvey gives her, her space. Then slowly he
          approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. Long beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's actually easier for me
                    to be disappointed. I think I'm
                    actually angry at you for trying to
                    take that away.
          
          Long beat. Just then Kate's phone rings. She reaches into her
          bag and takes it out. She stares at the phone, thinking for a
          beat, before answering.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                        (firmly)
                    Mum, I love you, but not now.
          
          She hangs up. Long beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Should I take that as a hopeful
                    sign?
          
          Kate can't help but smile.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    If you just give me a little wider
                    smile.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling/laughing)
                    Oh, shut up, Harvey.
          
          Beat. Kate collecting herself, looks up at Harvey.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So how's this going to work, Mr
                    Shine?
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  96.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    I have absolutely no idea...
                        (beat)
                    But it will.
                        (beat)
                    I promise you that.
          
          Kate stares at Harvey for the longest while. Then...
          
                              KATE
                    Shall we walk?
          
          Beat. Harvey nods.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yes.
          
          Kate gathers up her things, stands and joins Harvey. They
          begin to walk.
          
          After a short while Kate stops, puts her hand on Harvey's
          shoulder and takes off her shoes.
          
                              KATE
                    That's better.
          
          Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I think you're my kinda girl.
          
          Harvey and Kate smile. And as they walk away from us we hear.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you ask me those

	FADE IN

	The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, 
	emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some 
	distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of 
	sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The 
	whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant 
	rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
	We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 

	SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
	
	rockets through the frame scaring us and ... 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
	running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's 
	twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later 
	this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. 

	PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS

	flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A 
	calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads 
	over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled 
	tomahawk is stuffed in his belt.

	in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... 
	
	CHEST

	A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over 
	his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is 
	shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you 
	can ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is 

	CHINGACHGOOK.

	The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because 
	"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly 
	blow." 

	WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK

	runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel 
	to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's 
	very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate 
	motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes 
	there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. 
	These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into 
	ravines as if they own them. They do. 

	CUT TO ... 

	ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY

	rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a 
	wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is 
	carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. 
	His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and 	the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other 
	frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes 
	know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree 
	branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN

	two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... 

	SUDDENLY HE STOPS

	Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	HAWKEYE'S THUMB

	cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. 

	UNCAS

	stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this 
	an ambush? 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT

	Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, 
	off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. 

	KILLDEER'S TRIGGER

	tighter ... 

	THE COCK

	holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the 
	pan of priming powder which flashes and ... 

	TAN
	is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	CRACKS like lightning. 

	AN ELK

	leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment 
	of impact ... 

	WIDE

	three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting 
	together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and 
	angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. 
	The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. 
	Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's 
	more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner 
	and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). 
	As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...]

	He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges

			How is Chingachgook, then? 

	Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint

	Pause, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here? 

					JACK
			A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's

			here to raise this county's militia to aid the

					HAWKEYE
			Folks here goin' to join in that fight?

					JACK
			Few'd deny that? Where you headin'?

			Trap over the fall and winter among the 
			Delawares in Can-tuck-ee. 

					UNCAS
			So I can find a woman and make Mohican 
			children so our father will leave my brother

	Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye & Chingachgook. 

					JAMES
			A son like me? 

	Uncas grabs James & suspends him upside down.

					UNCAS
			No. You are too strong. Turn me old

	Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing & can't stay still. 
	Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.

			That's what he's doin' to his mama ... 

	She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. Uncas goes to 
	help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself. The men 
	gather around. There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison 
	and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew. Everyone waits.

	slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In the background are
	sixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. 
	We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
	mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. 
	Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
	eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are 
	an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
	Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. 

					HENRI

					MARTIN

			place. 

	Meanwhile ... 

	ONGEWASGONE

	is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
	says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
	outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
	tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. 

					ONGEWASGONE
			John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... 
			Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les 
			Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les 
			Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... 

	These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
	"mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The
	Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
	acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
	Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
	commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a
	hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
	with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of 
	co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
	 mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
	indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
	hunters and trappers ... working people.

					ONGEWASGONE
				(continues) 
			Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. 
			My brothers have asked me to lead them in this 
			war so I speak for the Twin River Council. 

	The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. 

					LIEUTENANT
			His Majesty King George II is very grateful for 
			your support. 

					IAN
			How far up the valley? 

					LIEUTENANT
			To Fort William Henry. 

					COLONIAL #1
			... two days from here. 

	Some don't like this.

					LIEUTENANT
			It should be enough to remind you France is 
			the enemy. 

					HAWKEYE
			Your enemy ... 

	Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.

					LIEUTENANT
			What did you say? 

					HAWKEYE
				(loud)
			I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
			Really? Do you want them to overrun all 
			New York colony? 

					HAWKEYE
			First place, you started it with the French over 
			fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. 
				(smiles) 
			Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on 
			their hands ... 

					LIEUTENANT
				(ignoring Hawkeye)
			Will you men help us stop the French? 

					HAWKEYE
			... and while they are cooped up in your fort, 
			what if the French send war parties to raid 
			their homes? 

					IAN
			What then, Lieutenant? 

					LIEUTENANT
			For your own homes, for king, for country, that's 
			why you men ought to join this fight! 

					HAWKEYE
			You do what you want with your own scalp.
			Do not be tellin' us what to do
			with ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
				(furious; to Hawkeye)
			You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? 

					HAWKEYE
			... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject 
			at all. 

	Light laughter.

					COLONIAL #2
			Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll 
			try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of 
			my bean field. 

					AD LIBS
			Yes. Yeah. No ... 

					CAMERON
			I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,
			his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he 
			comes back. 

					JACK
			Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to 
			fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb 
			accepts a few terms I got in mind ... 

	HAWKEYE & UNCAS

	cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables. 
	It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter,
	no hostility. 

					AD LIBS 
				(O.S.) 
			Webb? what's that, Jack ...? 

	As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.

					IAN
			You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? 

					UNCAS
			We had our say, Ian. 

	They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the
	background, watching.

	HEYWARD

	as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe.

			William Henry.

					HEYWARD

			You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage. 

	GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are
	on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the
	door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack
	Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... 

					LIEUTENANT
			They will report or be pressed into service! 

					LARGE COLONIAL REP
			Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into 
			forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that 
			leave ya, then? 

	Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone.
	Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.

					LIEUTENANT
			They will be found! Arrested ... 

					WEBB
				(cuts in)
			I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, 
			would ever object to his American subjects 
			defending their hearth & home, their women & children, 
			if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, 
			aroused to such excess by our enemy, the 
			ever-perfidious French. 

					JACK
			Does that mean they will be granted leave to 
			defend their homes if the settlements are 
			attacked? 

					WEBB
			Of course. 

	Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,
	including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.

					JACK
			You got yourself a colonial militia, General. 

					HEYWARD
			Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! 

	Webb's pouring gin.

					WEBB
			Duncan. How was your journey? 

	The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's
	two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the
	dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.

					HEYWARD
			I didn't experience anything so surprising from 
			Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. 

					WEBB
			And what is that? 

					HEYWARD
			The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service? 

					WEBB
			I know.
				(assuming a co-commiserator)
			One has to give Americans "reasons" and make 
			agreements to get them to do anything at all. 
			Tiring, isn't it? 
				(throws up his hands)
			But that's the way of it here. 

					HEYWARD
				(tight)
			I thought British policy is 'Make the 
			World ... England', sir. 

	A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.

					WEBB
			You will take command of the 62nd Regiment 
			of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel 
			Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard 
			from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to 
			rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them 
			to the fort. 

					WEBB
			Yes. You may.
				(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)
			You there. What does Munro call you?
				(to Heyward) 
			The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies 
			to guide you. 

	MAGUA

	rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is
	shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a
	shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long
	tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.

					WEBB
			The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's 
			house. A company of the 33rd will accompany 
			you and Magua will show you the way. 

					HEYWARD
			By your leave, sir. 

	Webb holds Heyward a moment

					WEBB
				(to Adjutants)
			Explain to the Major we care little about toying 
			with colonial militia because we have little to 
			fear from the French. They have not the nature 
			for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with 
			their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would
			rather make love with their faces than fight. 

	Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's
	been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.
	Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:

					WEBB
				(continuing) 
			Dismissed. 

	Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in
	return.

					HEYWARD
				(to Magua)
			Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See 
			to it you're there.

	Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of 	these Brits see it. We do.

	courtyard. Suddenly he hears ...

			Heyward! Duncan Heyward. 

	Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could
	like. 

	REVERSE: CORA MUNRO

	enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's
	educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and

	background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea
	setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's
	jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:

					CORA
			I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so 
			long apart and after you've traveled so far ... 

					HEYWARD
			And by sea! 

					CORA
			You still have an aversion to the water? 

					HEYWARD
			Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ... 

	Cora laughs.

					HEYWARD
			But it was worth it all to end in a garden by 
			your side.

	She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.

					CORA
				(difficult)
			Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest 
			friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect 
			you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings 
			don't go beyond that. Do you see? 

					HEYWARD
			Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis 
			for a man and woman to be joined? And all 
			else may grow in time ...? 

					CORA
			Some say that's the way of it. 

					HEYWARD
			"Some"? 

					CORA
			Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... 

					HEYWARD
				(interrupts)
			Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, 
			we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let 
			those whom you trust, your father, help 
			settle what's best for you. In view of your 
			indecision, why not rely on their advice and 
			judgment as well as mine? 

	Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something
	subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.


					HEYWARD
			Will you consider that? 

					CORA
				(pause; smiles)
			Yes. Yes, I will. 

	She's still unsettled.

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Duncan! 

	REVERSE: ALICE MUNRO

	eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs 
	to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs.

					HEYWARD
			My God, you've grown up. 

					ALICE
			We leave in the morning?! 

					HEYWARD
				(rises)
			Yes, miss. 

					ALICE
			I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! 
			I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman 
			Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, 
			red men in the wild! 

					CORA
			My God, Alice. 

					HEYWARD
				(smiles)
			It can be dangerous ... 

					ALICE
			Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us 
			if it were dangerous. 

	Alice takes Hewyward's hand. Cora pours Heyward more tea. The white sheets billow. 

					AMBROSE
				(O.S. - barks)
			Atten-shun! 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR BRITISH ARMY HQ - TWENTY BRITISH REGULARS - DAY

	jolt upright as if electrified.

					AMBROSE
				(entering) 
			Shoulder arms! 

	AMBROSE

	a sergeant major of forty-one is wide and deep and built like a fullback. You do not 	mess with Sgt. Major Ambrose.

					AMBROSE
				(barks) 
			Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!! 

	THE MEN

	march in perfect drill into two groups, each three across and three deep. 

	MILITARY HQ, ENTRANCE - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD

	steps out. Rigid salutes. 

	HEYWARD

	climbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora & Alice are in riding dresses
	 and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the
	flush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight
	 traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more
	mature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses and mule are in
	the gap between the two companies. 

	MAGUA

	cradling his musket. 

	REAR SHOT: THE COLUMN

	down the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive. 

	WIDER: THE COLUMN

	marching. Now they look brave but smaller. The forest - with all its mysteries and
	dangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, sinister, and it's immensity swallows up
	the living mass which slowly enters its bosom.

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FOREST

	TRACKING the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with lines of
	perspiration. They march in perfect formation. 

	We TRACK PAST the pack horses, the first company, Sgt. Major Ambrose and on to
	Cora & Alice. Alice seems fatigued. Cora's turned, looking up into the forest canopy,
	astonished at the deep beauty of the place. 

	CORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY

	of trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden.
	It's the forest of childhood. 

	In a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.

					CORA
				(O.S.)
			Alice, did you see that ...? 

	CORA'S

	reverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame. 

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Alice rouses from fatigue.

					HEYWARD
			Are you alright? 

					ALICE
			Can we rest soon? 

					HEYWARD
			Absolutely. 

	Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead
	of everybody else.

					HEYWARD
			You there, Scout! 

	Magua slowly turns towards Heyward.

					HEYWARD
				(overly articulated) 
			We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. 
			You ... understand? 

					MAGUA
				(perfect English)
			I understand. This is not good place to stop. 
			Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. 
			That where we stop. Better place. 

					HEYWARD
			No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the 
			ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you 
			understand? 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron: English subtitle)
			"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.
			When his women want to eat, he lay aside his 
			tomahawk to feed their laziness." 

					HEYWARD
			Excuse me. What did you say? 

					MAGUA
			Magua say: "Yes. Good idea." 

	As they begin to stop ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR MOUNTAINS & FOREST - WIDE - DAY

	Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and
	Uncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're
	eighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield
	Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All
	three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. 

	FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK

	- in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.
	Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... 

	ROCK

	under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds
	another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,
	searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas
	and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest
	ninety degrees from their previous path. 

	TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:
	expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY 

	on point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest
	acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards
	camera. 

	CLOSER - MAGUA'S

	slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft
	drop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure
	we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. 
	TRACK WITH Magua.
	Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching
	in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. 
	We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.

	REDCOAT

	is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is
	two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the
	spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the
	neck of the center man in the first row. 

	SIMULTANEOUSLY

	thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. 

	FIVE REDCOATS

	are blown off the path, two others are wounded ... 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Form company! Left face! March! 

	ALICE

	shrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. 

	HEYWARD

	pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... 

	CORA'S HORSE

	bucking. 

	ALICE'S HORSE

	bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Company make ready! 

	The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All
	thirteen face the incline. 

	FORESTED RISE - HURONS

	flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares
	and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires
	covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast
	and rapidly closing.
	Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their
	tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... 

					AMBROSE
			Present!! 

	CORA

	covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. 

	HEYWARD

	from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... 

	AN ATTACKING HURON

	leaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. 

	MULE

	with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left.
	Then eight. 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Fire!! 

	A musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through
	leaves. But ... 

	REVERSE:

	Hurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. 

					AMBROSE
				(continuing)
			Load! Prime! 

	The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? 

					AMBROSE
				(continuing)
			Present! Present! 

	Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks,
	war clubs and point-blank musket fire. 

	ALICE

	on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister,
	and ... 

	HEYWARD'S

	horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... 

	MAGUA

	shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... 

 	HEYWARD

	by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron
	and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the
	thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. 

	BRITISH

	dead and dying. 

	AMBROSE

	blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a
	second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British
	while four race towards Heyward and the two women. 

	HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE

	ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... 

	THREE LOUD SHOTS

	BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. 

	REVERSE: THREE MEN

	barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize
	Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. 

	HURON'S

	not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into
	the ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. 

	HURON

	warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas
	ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA 
	as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded
	Redcoats who fight on ... 

	MAGUA

	calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very
	revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will
	remember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... 

	CORA MUNRO

	who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? 

	HAWKEYE

	sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	TIME SLOWS: MAGUA

	senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.
 	Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... 

	TIME UNFREEZES

	Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... 

	HAWKEYE

	shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing
	Killdeer's trigger as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE

	from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened
	so quickly. It's nearly mystical. 

	HAWKEYE

	lowers Killdeer, impressed. 

	CORA

	glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he
	hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... 

	HEYWARD

	in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that
	he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... 

					CORA
			No, Duncan! 

	Duncan ignores her. 

	HEYWARD'S MUSKET

	is jerked from his hands.

					HAWKEYE
			 ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. 

	He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's
	pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind
	Heyward. As Heyward spins ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB

	flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook
	retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... 

	UNCAS

	scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. 

	WIDE

	Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the
	savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. 

	ALICE

	Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean
	and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their
	baggage is gone. 

	HEYWARD'S

	crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British
	military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. 	two of the wounded start to rise ... 

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Stop it! 

	Heyward spins. 

 	UNCAS

	just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks
	him.

					ALICE
			We need them to get out of here! 

	Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage".
	Heyward runs in to protect the women ...

					HEYWARD
				(to Nathaniel)
			... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! 

	Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.

					UNCAS
				(matter of fact) 
			... too easy to track ... they can be heard for 
			miles ... find yourself a musket ... 

	Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. 
			They'll never make a passage north. 

					HEYWARD
				(breathless)
			We were headed ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(appropriating a knife)
			... Fort William Henry. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's
	Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts
	off.

					HAWKEYE
			... take you as far as the fort. 

	Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at
	them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.

					HAWKEYE
			If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. 
			Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. 
			So if you all rather wait for the next Huron 
			war party to come by, we'll be on our way. 

	Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and
	Chingachgook. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY

	moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &
	Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... 

	HAWKEYE'S FEET

	walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others
	follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian
	frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] 

					HEYWARD
			How far is it, scout? 

					HAWKEYE
			Day and a half 
				(pause) 
			Where did you get ... the guide? 

					HEYWARD
			Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our 
			Mohawk allies. 

					HAWKEYE
			He is Huron and nothing else. 
				(checking the Munro girls are 
				not too close)
			Why would he want to murder the girl? 

					HEYWARD
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dark haired ... 

					HEYWARD
			Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on 
			her before today. 

					HAWKEYE
			No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? 

					HEYWARD
			Of course not! 
				(pause) 
			And how is it you were nearby? 

					HAWKEYE
			Came across the war party, tracked 'em. 

					HEYWARD
			Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. 

					HEYWARD
			Fort Edward, then? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. 

					HEYWARD
			I thought all our colonial scouts were in 
			the militia? 

	Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.

					HAWKEYE
			I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn 
			militia. 

					HEYWARD
				(stops) 
			Then you are one of those who would allow 
			England to fight alone while she protects 
			you from France? 

					HAWKEYE
			England does not protect me and does not 
			war against France on our account. She uses 
			us to war against France on her own account ... 
			of greed for land and furs. 

	CORA'S

	appalled.

					HAWKEYE
				(turns) 
			Clear it up any? 

					HEYWARD
				(loud) 
			I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! 

					HAWKEYE
				(low)
			Do not let gratitude get in the way ... 

	Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms
	over him.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Yengeese no good in woods. Make more 
			noise, I kill him. 

	Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with
	Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... 

	UNCAS

	stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	is already moving out front, low and fast ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY

	After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas
	join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. 
	Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... 

	EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY

	Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the
	doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred
	and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the
	collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and
	are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. 

	ALICE

	approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but
	confronts it directly.

					HEYWARD
				(O.S.) 
			Anything to be done? 

	UNCAS

	returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the
	degree of their inner pain.

					UNCAS
			All dead ... 

	HAWKEYE

	bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other
	grimly. Heyward joins them.

					HEYWARD
			Who were these people? 

					HAWKEYE
				(re: print) 
			Ottawa! 

					HEYWARD
			Excuse me ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Ottawa. 

	UNCAS

	enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay
	where he is: on the periphery with the women.

					UNCAS
			Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Chingachgook)
			Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... 
			this was a war party? 

	Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance
	is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... 

					HEYWARD
			Let us look after them ... 

	He starts approaching the bodies.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Leave them. 

	Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.

					CORA
				(hasn't moved)
			Though they are strangers, they are at 
			least entitled to a Christian burial! 

					HAWKEYE
				(shaking his head) 
			Let us go, miss. 

					CORA
			I will not. I have seen the face of war 
			before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on
			women and children. And almost as 
			cruel is your indifference. 

	Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.

					HAWKEYE
				(contained)
			Miss Munro.
				(pause)
			They are not strangers .... 
			And they stay as they lay ...! 

	CORA

	realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the
	first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and
	rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a
	moment. 

	WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE

	as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,
	walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward
	helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.

	The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and
	some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others
	avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,
	soundlessly. 

	HAWKEYE

	throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound
	and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. 

	ALICE'S HEAD

	hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on
	watch.
	Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped
	mound.
	Cora has sought him out. 

	HAWKEYE

	doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. 
	They whisper ... 

					CORA
			Why didn't you bury those people? 

					HAWKEYE
			Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would 
			see it as a sign of our passing ... 

					CORA
			You knew them. 

	Hawkeye looks at her and nods.

					CORA
				(stiffly)
			You were acting for our benefit. And I 
			apologize. I misunderstood you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Well that is to be expected. My father ... 

					CORA
			Your "father"? 

					HAWKEYE
			Chingachgook. He warned me about 
			people like you. 

					CORA
			He did? 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them 
			understand you." 

					CORA
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. And "do not try to understand them. 
			That is because they are a breed apart and 
			they make no sense ..." 

	Cora's indignation is cut off because ... 

	UNCAS

	moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas
	disappears around the mound. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT

	Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the
	white birch. 

	RED-PAINTED FACE

	white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. 
	Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by
	others. Wary, silently, they hunt. 

	DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA

	Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de
	la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and
	breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
	the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
	Ottawa find our people, it's all over. 

	ALICE

	seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and
	involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and
	silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,
	looking towards the advancing Ottawa. 

	HAWKEYE

	on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. 

	OTTAWA & FRENCH

	are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist
	envelops them ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. 

	HAWKEYE

	waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's
	impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop
	of moccasined feet ... 

	OTTAWA

	through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader
	gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.
	The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers
	something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." 
	And means it. They retreat. 

	SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA

	tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,
	catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	sees all of it; doesn't like it. 

	HAWKEYE

	The Ottawa are gone.

					CORA
				(quietly)
			Why did they turn back? 

	In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.

	CORA

	turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted
	against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial
	place. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the
	danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost
	touch.

					CORA
				(still pissed off)
			"We're a breed apart and we make no 
			sense" ...? 

					HAWKEYE
				(smiles) 
			In your particular case, miss, I would 
			make some allowance ... 

					CORA
				(sarcastic)
			Thank you so much. 

	Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.
	Her mood changes. Then ... 

					CORA
			You called Chingachgook your "father"?
			Where is your real family? 

	Hawkeye's surprised by her question.

					HAWKEYE
			They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.
			And Chingachgook - who found me with 
			two French trappers - raised me up as his 
			own. 

					CORA
			I'm sorry. 

					HAWKEYE
			I do not remember them. I was one or two. 

					CORA
			How did you learn English? 

					HAWKEYE
			My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend 
			Wheelock's school when I was ten. So
			we would know both worlds ... though 
			we were told only bother learning readin' &
			arithmetic from yous. 

					CORA
			And what were the consequentialities of 
			European culture you didn't bother with? 

					HAWKEYE
			The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas 
			about the government of men. My father's 
			people already know each man is his own 
			nation. And only he can have dominion 
			over himself. Not kings. No man is better 
			than any other man. 

					CORA
			In London those radical ideas could land 
			you in Newgate prison. 
				(changing the subject)
			Why were those people living in this 
			defenseless place ...? 

					HAWKEYE
			'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable
			to poor people. So after seven years 
			indentured service in Virginia, they headed
			out here where they are beholden to none
			and not livin' by another's leave ... 
			Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

	Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continuing; looking up)
			My father's people say ... at the birth of the 
			sun and of his brother, the moon, their 
			mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth 
			her body, from which was to spring all life.
			And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
			The stars he threw into the night sky to 
			remind him of her soul. 
				(the sky)
			So there is the Camerons' monument ... 
			my folks', too, I guess. 

	CORA'S

	pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... 

					CORA
				(low)
			You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not 
			understand what is happening here.
			And it is not as I imagined it would be, 
			thinking of it in Boston and London ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry to disappoint you ... 

					CORA
				(eyes downcast)
			On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... 
			to my blood ...
				(then up into his eyes)
			... than any imagining could possibly have 
			been ... 

	She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring
	into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were 
	wrong ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a
	branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is
	Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.

					CORA
			Much further? 

					HAWKEYE
			Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are 
			downhill of it. 

	ALICE

	Re-energized, her spirits pick up.

					ALICE
			Will we be able to bathe? 

	Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.

					CORA
			Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and
	Chingachgook. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS

	and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into
	two groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...

					HEYWARD
			The men of the regiment will fetch water from 
			the lake, build fires and provide every comfort 
			you desire, Alice ... 

					ALICE
			Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora 
			doesn't marry you, I shall. 

					CORA
			Alice! 

	Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including
	Cora, shed their frontier experience?

					ALICE
			I can't wait to see Papa ... 

					CORA
			And you, Duncan? What are you looking 
			forward to? 

					HEYWARD
			Posting to a different continent. 

	He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.

					CORA
			I think it's very important and exciting. 

	Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD

	helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to
	Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark
	thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. 

	WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE

	drops and pulls Cora to the ground.

					CORA
			Lightning? 

	Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to
	the top of the ridge. 

	CLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE

	join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the
	wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. 

	THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY

	is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense
	smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red
	glare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder. 

	HIS POV: OTTAWA

	pursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. 

	DISSOLVE TO ...

	EXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK

	French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. 

	TRENCH

	dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two
	poles and fascis on the sides. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	searching the night. 

	POV: BATTLEFIELD

	is black. 

	ENGLISH ROCKETS

	light the battlefield revealing the French trenches. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	excited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew
	scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #1 

	FIRES. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #2

	FIRES. 

	EXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY

	TRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and
	earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but
	we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... 

	WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER

	A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the
	fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark
	shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a
	birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. 

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS

	Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. 

	LOW & WIDE: SNIPERS

	Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,
	followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
	the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
	senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
	flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
	the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks
	him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL
	- NIGHT

	Amidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince
	battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port. Our people rush in. 

	TORCH LIGHT

	the group moves through the long, dank, tunnel. Enlisted men escorting them. Another
	torch from the other direction: CAPTAIN BEAMS is revealed.

					HEYWARD
			I'm Major Duncan Heyward! 

					BEAMS
			Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think 
			you'd make it through! 

					HEYWARD
			Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are 
			here, too. 

	Beams raises his torch, sees the muddied, soaked women. He is shocked that they
	traveled with Heyward. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARADE GROUND - GROUP - NIGHT

	emerges from a sally-port tunnel. It's smokey. NOISE is deafening. The group has
	traveled through a nightmare, only to arrive in hell. 

	HEYWARD WITH BEAMS, CORA & HAWKEYE, ALICE, UNCAS &
	CHINGACHGOOK

	run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball, smoldering beams and shrapnel,
	wounded men. Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew. On the
	ramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French. Women huddle in 
	corners next to the sick and dying. 

	UNDER RAMPARTS: MILITIA

					AD LIBS
				(shouts over roar)
			Uncas! Nathaniel ... 

	HAWKEYE

	waves. One wounded man, IAN, intercepts Uncas.

					IAN
			Thought you and Nathaniel weren't 
			joinin'-up. 

					UNCAS
				(on the run) 
			Didn't! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'. 

	COLONEL MUNRO

	running from his quarters is shocked to see them.

					ALICE
				(hysterical) 
			Papa, Papa!! 

					MUNRO
				(enraged) 
			Why are you here?! 

	Cora is stunned. Alice is decimated by her father's anger. Munro sees and whips off his
	coat to cover them and takes Alice under his arm. Bombardment resumes. Alice clings
	while they race for the cover of his quarters:] 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora) 
			Why did you allow them to come? ... And
			where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!! 

	They race into the yellow lantern light of Munro's quarters and slam and bolt the heavy
	door. Heyward's confused ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

					MUNRO
				(embracing his daughters; softer) 
			Told you to stay away from this hell hole!
			Why did you disobey me? 

					CORA
			When? How? 

					MUNRO
			My letter ... 

					CORA
			There was none! 

					MUNRO
			What? 

					CORA
			There was no letter. 

					MUNRO
			I sent three men to Webb! 

					HEYWARD
			One called Magua arrived. 

					CORA
			He delivered no such message. 

	Munro's stunned.

					MUNRO
			Does Webb not even know we are besieged? 

					HEYWARD
			Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does 
			not know to send reinforcements! 

	Munro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,
	the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers
	like Webb would disdain his Scots origins. 
	From under his fury: 

					MUNRO
				(flat)
			What happened to you? 

					HEYWARD
				(suddenly tired) 
			Ambush ... on the George Road. This
			Magua led us into it.
				(pause)
			... eighteen killed. It's these men who 
			saved us. They guided us here ... 

					MUNRO
			Thank you. How can I reward you? 

	No answer. Then ...

					HAWKEYE
			Help ourselves to a few horns from your 
			powder stores. 

					MUNRO
			What else? 

					UNCAS
			Some food. 

					MUNRO
				(to Uncas)
			I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, 
			young man. 

	MUNRO

	sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next
	rooms. 

					MUNRO
				(bellows) 
			Mr. Phelps! 

	PHELPS' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro.

					PHELPS
			Miss Cora! How are you? 

					CORA
				(smiles) 
			Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a 
			suturing needle? 
				(for Uncas)
			And we could use some rum, clothes, and 
			a place to wash ... 

	Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her
	tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.
	They exit. 

	MUNRO

	is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward over table map)
			What a place for them ... 


					HEYWARD
			Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given 
			that I've seen of the French engineering from 
			the ridge above? 

					MUNRO
				(perfunctory)
			 Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine 
			and he has more of them. They keep our heads 
			down while his sappers make thirty yards of 
			trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a 
			two hundred yard range, so when they're close 
			enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive 
			rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. 

					HEYWARD
			They look to be three hundred yards out. 
			You have three days. 

					MUNRO
			Bloody murderers. 

					HAWKEYE
			A man, here, can make a run straight through 
			to Webb. 

					MUNRO
			... not enough time to get to Albany and back 
			with reinforcements ... 

	A Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.

					HEYWARD
			Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to 
			Fort Edward two days ago. 

					MUNRO
			Webb's at Edward? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes, sir. 

					MUNRO
			Only twelve miles away! He could be here day 
			after tomorrow. 
				(to Hawkeye)
			Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you 
			the message. 

	Beams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.

					HAWKEYE
			John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last 
			night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And 
			it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French. 

	Munro looks at him.

					MUNRO
			Yes, Mr. Poe? So? 

					HAWKEYE
			It was a war party. It means they're on the 
			attack up and down the frontier. 

	Munro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must
	be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.

					MUNRO
				(cold)
			Thank you. 

	Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.

					HAWKEYE
			Many men here, their homes are in the path. 

					MUNRO
			That's all, sir. 

	Hawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters
	almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook
	pass.

					HEYWARD
			Things were done. Nobody was spared ... 

					MUNRO
			Terrible feature of war in the Americas. 
				(beat; a mantra)
			Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty. 
			Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs 
			on a courier to Webb. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT

	of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois
	language. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards
	are at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a
	braceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot
	battle standard and flag of France. 

	MONTCALM

	stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk
	turban ...

					SENECA CHIEF
				(low)
			... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left 
			us no time to put our cabins in order before telling 
			us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled 
			our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we 
			are not the first and closest to my father's campfire. 

	The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his
	waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than
	Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm
	sees and nods to ... 

	MAGUA

	entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp
	lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat
	blanket drapes his left shoulder. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Seneca Chief)
			For my children and the children of the true 
			faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... 
			I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow 
			I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the 
			great council house. 

	The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's
	face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is
	based on realpolitik.

					MONTCALM
			Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your 
			English friends? 

	Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European
	style ...

					MONTCALM
				(over his shoulder)
			Louis Antoine, join us. 

	LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of
	Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. 

					MONTCALM
			Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ... 

	Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a
	secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he
	was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight
	he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he
	brought "bougainvillea" from Tahiti to Europe to America.

					MAGUA
			English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward 
			with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my 
			father's army attacks Fort William Henry. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't 
			get through. He'll send another. 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair will try. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			Four or five, including two women entered the 
			fort ... 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's 
			knife but escaped. They'll be under it again. 

					MONTCALM
			Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? 

					MAGUA
			When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat 
			his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his 
			children under the knife so the Grey Hair will 
			see his seed is wiped out forever. 

	Montcalm won't get a direct answer.

					MONTCALM
			My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through 
			the night, now. You may have your opportunity 
			soon.

	INTERIOR SURGERY, ENTRANCE - PHELPS - NIGHT

	exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
				She know what she's doin'? 

	Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora. She's in a borrowed
 	launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's a little indignant.

					PHELPS
			First assisted me in Austria when she was 
			fourteen. I would say she does ... 

	Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's
	not her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's
	nevertheless falling for Cora.

					HAWKEYE
			She does not shy away from much ... 

					PHELPS
				(elsewhere) 
			What's that? 

					HAWKEYE
			Nothin'. 

	Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement
	meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to
	her.

					PHELPS (O.S.)
			Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you. 

	HAWKEYE

	enters. Cora's sewing up Uncas.

					CORA
				(looks up) 
			Mr Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Miss. 
				(re: cotton) 
			May I? 

	Cora, curious, nods. Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress
	that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't know why; neither does Cora.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Uncas) 
			You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? 

	Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to
	tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora
	turns.

					CORA
			What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Why, I am looking at you, Miss. 

	Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling.
	Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves.

	The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect
	order. The sally-port is closed. Three men are wounded. The diversion worked
	perfectly. 

					HEYWARD
			Sergeant Major! 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Sir! 

					HEYWARD
			Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Atten-hut! 

	TROOPERS & MILITIA

	have seen no action for three days & nights. Heyward got their blood running and won
	their respect. They step aside and nod to him. Heyward keeps walking. He is home. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S BEDCHAMBER - DOOR - NIGHT

	a knock and Heyward enters. 

	CORA & ALICE

	Alice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging.

					HEYWARD
			Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll 
			come back another time ... 

	Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.

					CORA
			Alice ... 

					ALICE
			Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... 
			I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. 
				(starts
				for door)
			I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... 

	She leaves.

					HEYWARD
			I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... 

					CORA
			Her nerves are shattered. She's trying 
			to be brave. 

	There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's
	disconcerting.

					HEYWARD
			Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, 
			we will be the happiest couple in England ... 
			I am certain of that. More than ever before. 
				(softens)
			I believe you must trust the judgment of others 
			who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ... 

					CORA
			Duncan ... 
				(pause)
			Duncan, I promised you an answer. You 
			have complimented me with your persistence 
			and patience ... But the decision I've come 
			to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes 
			than surrender my own judgment. 

	Heyward is stunned.

					CORA
			And it's been unfair to you, while I search 
			myself for feelings, which, if they were
			there and as strong as they ought to be, 
			would've made themselves known long ago ...
				(pause)
			Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. 
			And please take this as my final answer. 
			It must be no. 

	Heyward' shattered inside.

					HEYWARD
			I see ... 

					CORA
			I am sorry, Duncan ... 

	Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. 

	CLOSE: CORA

	The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered
	walls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA

	moving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above
	one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ...  

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
			... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The 
			cabin was attacked by a war party. They are 
			sweeping south down the frontier spreading 
			terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos 
			all the men are here. 

					IAN (O.S.)
			And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of 
			Cameron's! 

	Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. 

	CORA'S POV: THE ROOM

	Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro,
	Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.

					MUNRO
				(to Jack)
			I must receive proof more conclusive than 
			Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our 
			defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. 

					JACK
			Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken 
			together, that's gospel. Your fort will	 stand 
			or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, 
			not these colonials' presence. 

					MUNRO
			I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not 
			you. 

					HAWKEYE
			That judgment is not more important than their 
			right under agreement with Webb to defend their 
			farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John 
			Cameron's. He saw what it was. 

					MUNRO
				(looking to Heyward for 
				confirmation of his point of view) 
			What did you see, Major? 

	Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... 

	CORA

	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. 

	HEYWARD

	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
	At the same time ... 

	CORA

	examines him with a cool, level stare. 

	HEYWARD

	looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they
	need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of
	decision ...  

					HEYWARD
				(to Munro)
			I saw nothing that would lead me to the 
			conclusion it was other than a raid by savages 
			bent on thievery. 

	Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.

					HAWKEYE
			You're a liar! 

	CORA'S

	saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. 

	HEYWARD

	can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... 

	HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY

	She's gone. 

	HEYWARD

	suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.

					HAWKEYE
			And the blood is on your hands! 

	Heyward reaches for his sword. 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward) 
			I'll have none of that! 
				(to colonials) 
			Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. 
			Not a butcher. 

					HAWKEYE
			Easy for you to suppose. While it is their 
			women and children, not yours, alone in 
			their farms! 

					MUNRO
				(exploding)
			You forget yourself! 

					JACK
			We are not forgettin' Webb's promise! 

					MUNRO
			British promises are honored. And the militia 
			will not be released. Because I need more 
			definite proof than this man's word! 

					JACK
			Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a 
			long time before you got here! 

					MUNRO
			This interview's over! The militia stays! 

					JACK
				(to Munro) 
			Does the rule of English law no longer govern? 
			Has it been replaced by absolutism? 

	This is very dangerous talk.

					HAWKEYE
			And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe 
			these people would do better makin' a peace 
			with the French! 

					HEYWARD
			That is sedition! Treason! 

					HAWKEYE
			That is the truth! 

					HEYWARD
				(restaining himself) 
			I ought to have you whipped from this fort! 

					HAWKEYE
			Major! 
				(changes down)
			Some day I think you and I are gonna have 
			a serious disagreement. 

					MUNRO
				(steel) 
			Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving 
			Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition. 
			Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion. 
				(pause)
			 My decision is final. Get out. 

	Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on
	Hawkeye's face says this is not over. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT

	Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on
	fiddle & drums. It's stirring. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN

	laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few
	people lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. 

	THEIR FACES

	underlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a
	postage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict
	 because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs. 

	A PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE

	We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and
	new wreckage from the day's bombardment. 

					HAWKEYE
				(low)
			... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, 
			I'd be long gone. 

					IAN
			You didn't think it right to be here in the 
			first place. 

					HAWKEYE
			By my light that's how I saw it then and I 
			see it that way now ... 

					IAN
				(low)
			But we are under English military authority. 

					JACK
				(low) 
			I believe if they set aside their law as and when 
			they wish, their law no longer has rightful 
			authority over us. All they have over us is 
			tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. 
			No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone 
			caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each 
			man make your own decision ... Those who 
			are goin', be back here in an hour. 

					HAWKEYE
			Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east 
			side of the swamp until you clear the French 
			picket line. Head north over the ridge, then 
			come about southeast and fork left in Little 
			Meadow and you're free of the outpost and 
			skirmishers ... 

					A COLONIAL
				(grumbles)
			 Should've skinned outta this long ago. 

					COLONIAL #2
			Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay 
			and give 'em a hand even though ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Colonial #2)
			I'll cover them from the top of the casement. 

					JACK
				(in amazement)
			You're not coming with us? 

	Hawkeye shakes his head. 

					HAWKEYE
			Got a reason to stay. 

					JACK
			That reason wear a blue dress and work 
			in the surgery? 

	Low laughter

					HAWKEYE
				(dry)
			 It does and it is a better lookin' reason 
			than you, Jack Winthrop. 
				(more laughs) 
			Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French 
			outpost by dawn. 
				(sticks out his hand and
				grasps Winthrop's) 
			Good luck, Jack. 

	The men split up ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	FIRE - HAWKEYE

	wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight.
	 Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: CORA

	in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense she's been looking
	for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. 

	CLOSER

	Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves
	rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing
	through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful
	man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.
	Their shoulders touch. 

	CORA

	To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the
	passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to
	what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his
	arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation
	she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the
	huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a
	wild continent. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY

	door CRASHES inwards. Twelve British sentries storm in. Four bear torches. 

	REVERSE: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO COLONIALS &

					SERGEANT (O.S.)
			You! Halt! 

	BRITISH SENTRIES

	their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye.

					SERGEANT
			As you were!! 

	Hawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye drops his tomahawk
	and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas. The British in the
	torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya. 

					SERGEANT
			Take him! 

	Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			Why do they make my son prisoner? 

					HAWKEYE
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... 
			This fight is not yours, father. I love 
			you and my brother. And you should leave 
			this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			What will they do with my white son? 

	One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket. 

					GUARD
			Get back from him! 

	HEYWARD

	enters. 

	HAWKEYE

	shrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question. 

	HAWKEYE'S

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY

					CORA
			He saved us! We are alive only because 
			of him ... 

	WIDEN:

	Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes.
	Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't
	give a damn. 

					MUNRO
			The man encouraged the colonials to desert 
			in this very room, in my presence. He is 
			guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged 
			like any other criminal, regardless of what he 
			did for my children. 

					CORA
			He knew the consequences. And he stayed. 
			Are those the actions of a criminal? 
			... Duncan, do something. 

					HEYWARD
			He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. 
			He ought to pay without sending you to beg. 

					CORA
			You know he wouldn't send me ...! You 
			misrepresented what you saw and caused
			this. 
				(frustrated)
			I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... 

					MUNRO
			Not with enough certainty to outweigh British 
			interests in this fort. 

					HEYWARD
			And who empowered these provincials to pass 
			judgment upon England's policies in her own 
			colonies? To come and go without so much as 
			a "by your leave." 

					CORA
			They do not live their lives "by your leave." 
			... They hack it out of the wilderness with 
			their own two hands, burying their dead and 
			their children along the way. 

					HEYWARD
				(distant)
			 You are defending him because you've become 
			infatuated with him.

	Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. She contains her fury. 

					CORA
			Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable 
			qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong 
			to have thought so highly of you. 

	Heyward's shot through the heart.

					MUNRO
			But the man is guilty of sedition and subject 
			to military justice and beyond pardon. 

					CORA
			"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the 
			sooner French guns blow the English army
			out of America, the better it will be for 
			these people. 

					MUNRO
			You do not know what you are saying! 

					CORA
				(explodes)
			Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. 
			And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of 
			sedition, too! 

	She exits, leaving them there. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT, STOCKADE - NIGHT

	Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed
	to barring her entry. 

	INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE

	comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora. 

	THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA

	They are silent for a moment, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry ... can't ask you in. 

	Cora's pale smile. 

					CORA
			They're going to hang you. 
				(pause; soft)
			Why didn't you leave when you had the
			chance? 

					HAWKEYE
			Because what I am interested in is right 
			here ... 

					CORA
			What would you have me do? 

	He touches her hand. 

					HAWKEYE
			Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. 
			If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If 
			that happens, stay close to your father. 
			The French will protect the officer class 
			among the English. 

					CORA
			No. I will find you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Do not. 
				(pause)
			Promise me. 

	Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars. She acquiesces,
	nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora & Hawkeye look up. Mortar
	bombs begin striking the fortress. Still dark. The final French bombardment has
	started. 

					CORA
			The whole world's on fire, isn't it? 

	A pause.

					HAWKEYE
			This part of it sure is ... 

	Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others. On that
	image ...

	French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. They work like precision

	FRENCH TRENCH

	ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls. Crews
	reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars. 

	MORTAR ONE

	The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb. The primer charge
	is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into
	the lightening sky. The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT

	tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. The French mortar
	bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the
	crew. The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or
	terrorized. Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement,
	starting a fire.
	Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. One soldier dashes to
	rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away ... EXPLOSION.

	INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE

	crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next

					CORA
			What is it?

	Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY

	The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. 

	REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS

	Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and
	medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold
	fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). 

	FACES

	They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their
	supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To 	them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a
	tattoo behind them. 

	INDIAN FACES

	Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.
	They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed
	red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ...

	in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. 

	INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)

	COLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)

	watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. 

	WIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH

	and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the
	ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. 

					MONTCALM
			Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant 
			antagonist. I am happy to make your 
			acquaintance as a friend. 

					MUNRO
			And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. 

					MONTCALM
			Please accept my compliments for the strong 
			and skillful defense of your fortress. Under 
			the command of a lesser man it would have 
			fallen long ago given the superior numbers and 
			material ... mere chance has allowed me to 
			array against you ... 

					MUNRO
			Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a 
			diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. 

					MONTCALM
			You have already done everything which is 
			necessary for the honor of your Prince. I 
			will forever bear testimony that your resistance 
			has been gallant and was continued as long as 
			there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen 
			to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to 
			consider my terms for your surrender. 

					MUNRO
			However I may apprise such testimony from 
			Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is 
			strong and stands. 

					MONTCALM
			Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may 
			be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to 
			us every opportunity to reconnoiter your 
			works and I am possibly as well acquainted 
			with your weak condition as you are yourselves. 

	Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British
	reinforcements arrive? 

					MUNRO
			Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the 
			Hudson and he knows the size and imminence 
			of the army of Webb ...? 

	Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. 

					MONTCALM
				(quietly)
			My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended 
			for you. 

	Munro is puzzled, suspicious. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Bougainville)
			Read the dispatch. 

	HEYWARD & MUNRO]

					BOUGAINVILLE 
				(O.S. - reading)
			"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have 
			no men available to send to your rescue. It is 
			impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for 
			surrender. Signed Webb." 

	Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. 

					HEYWARD
				(confirming)
			This is the signature of Webb. 
				(to Munro)
			And I know the temper of our men. Rather 
			than spend the war in a French prison hulk 
			in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. 

					MUNRO
				(to Montcalm)
			 You have heard your answer, Monsieur le 
			Marquis. 
				(salutes) 

	Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. 

					MONTCALM
			Sir. 
				(challengingly)
			I am incapable of mistreating brave men. 
			I beg you not to sign the death warrant 
			of so many until you have listened to my 
			terms. 

	Munro turns. 

					MUNRO
			Such as ...? 

					MONTCALM
			My master requires the fort be destroyed. 
			But, for you and your comrades, there is 
			no privilege that will be denied. None of 
			your men will see the inside of a prison
			barge. They're free to go so long as they 
			return to England and fight no more on this
			continent, and the civilian militia return to 
			their farms. 

					MUNRO
			Their arms? 

					MONTCALM
			They may leave the fortress fully armed, but 
			with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask 
			what you wish. 

	Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. 

					MUNRO
			The honors of war? 

					MONTCALM
			Granted. 

					MUNRO
			My colors? 

					MONTCALM
			Carry them to England to your King with pride. 

					MUNRO
			Allow me to consult with my officers. 

	As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put
	back together. As the men move away from the French ... 

					MUNRO
			I have lived to see two things I never expected. 
			An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And 
			a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. 

					HEYWARD
			General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back 
			and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our 
			mission is to fight. 

					MUNRO
				(flares)
			Death and honor are sometimes thought to be 
			the same. Today I have learned that they are not. 

	Munro looks at the fortress behind him. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! 

					MUNRO
				(stops him with his eyes)
			The decision is final. 

	A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,
	scarred earth of the battlefield. 

					MUNRO
			I am deeply touched by such unusual and 
			unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours 
			under the condition that we be given until 
			dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and 
			women for their march and turn our wounded 
			over to your surgeon. 

					MONTCALM
			Granted, Monsieur. 

	And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ...

	William Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the

					SENTRY
			Qui vive? 

					MONTCALM
			France. 

					SENTRY
			Le mot d'ordre? 

					MONTCALM
			La victoire. 

					SENTRY
			C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin,

					MONTCALM
			Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. 

	The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and
	the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues
	walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM

	The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the
	front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.

					MAGUA
			Is the hatchet buried between the English 
			and my French father? 

					MONTCALM
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men 
			become friends. 

					MONTCALM
			My master owns these lands and your father 
			has been ordered to drive off the English 
			squatters. They have consented to go. So 
			now he calls them enemies no longer. 

					MAGUA
			Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. 
			It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will 
			be buried. 

					MONTCALM
			But so many suns have set since Le Renard 
			struck the war post. Is he not tired? 

					MAGUA
			Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. 
			It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, 
			they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell 
			all of their lands to enrich the European masters 
			who are always greedy for more than they need. 
				(threatening)
			And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have 
			been many clouds and many mountains. But now
			he has come to lead his nation. 

					MONTCALM
			That Le Renard has the power to lead his people 
			into the light, I know well. 

	Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's
	eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 

					MAGUA
			Does my father know that? 

	MAGUA'S CHEST

	A deep indentation and scar. 

					MONTCALM
			That's where a lead bullet has torn you. 

					MAGUA
			And this? 

	Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... 	deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] 

					MONTCALM
			My son has been sadly injured. Who did 
			this? 

					MAGUA
				(laughs; sardonic)
			Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. 
			And the sticks left their mark ... 
				(pause; for real)
			Magua's village and lodges were burnt. 
			Magua's children were killed by the English. 
			Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks 
			who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife 
			believed he was dead and became the wife of 
			another. The Grey Hair was the father of all 
			this. 
				(pause)
			In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk 
			to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. 
			And his heart will be whole again on the day 
			when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! 

					MONTCALM
			My son Magua's pain is my pain. 

					MAGUA
			Does the chief of the Canadas believe the 
			English will keep the terms? 

					MONTCALM
			Munro would. But General Webb will not
			send their soldiers across the salt lake. 
			Having let them go, I fear I will only fight 
			the same men again when I move south.
				(pause; shrugs)
			And yet, I cannot break the terms of the 
			capitulation and sully the lilies of France ... 

	Long pause, wheels turn. Then: 

					MAGUA
			Many things my French father cannot do, 
			Magua can. 

	Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. 

					MONTCALM
			As the English march away, our soldiers 
			and the Canadiens will be drawn to the 
			looting of the fort ... except for a small 
			guard ... 

	Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT

	walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,
	waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...

					MAGUA
				(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)
			I wonder at the blindness and pride of the 
			white man. He believes only he knows 
			how to speak falsely to make other men do 
			his bidding. 

	Magua exhales in derision. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY

	at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with
	armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just
	outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as 
	is - at the head - Montcalm. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. 

	MONTCALM

	salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	salutes Montcalm.

					MUNRO
				(eyes forward)
			Monsieur, the fort is yours. 

	MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD

	marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have
	thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The
	33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes
	Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. 

	FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE

	on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under
	the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is
	seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,
	sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 

	CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN

	The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a
	number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and
	many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.
	No Hawkeye. 

	CORA

	straining to see. 

	EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS

	being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands
	erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.
	Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... 

	UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own
	musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.
	Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. 

	RANK AND FILE FRENCH

	A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. 

	EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE

	His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts
	through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... 

	HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA

	riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and
	curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. 

	PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE

	as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're
	shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both
	slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out
	and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. 
	SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man
	wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He
	is heavily war-painted ... 

	FRONTAL - MAGUA

	and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much
	silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right
	fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. 

	MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 

	WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS

	Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. 

	CLOSER: CORA

	doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. 

	YOUNG HURON

	running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like
	a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 

	CLOSER

	the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a
	British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off
	again ... 

	CORA

	horrified, holds Alice tighter. 

	MUNRO

	has seen it too. And now he sees ... 

	62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT

	fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons
	and other Indians ... 

	TROOPERS

	of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks
	are cocked. There's the answer. 

					MUNRO
			Steady! No one fires! 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES

	are watching what happens. 

	HEYWARD

	scanning them. 

					HEYWARD
				(to Sergeant Major)
			Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Yes sir! 

	Drums beat the cadence.

	TROOPERS

	step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 

	END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer
	and his own musket. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES

	Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed
	to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. 

	CLOSER

	Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to
	the column, stalking it. Waiting ... 

	ANOTHER BRAVE

	racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 

	TWO SOLDIERS

	look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both
	bayonet the Indian. He's dead. 

	EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA

	saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. 

	MOHAWKS

	among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are
	cocking flintlocks. 

	MUNRO

	gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We
	hear him from the distance ordering ...

					MUNRO
			Do not break ranks! I want these ranks 
			to hold ...! 

	Cora's frightened.

	HAWKEYE'S

	frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's
	accelerating. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... 

	WOMEN

	with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are
	isolated incidents. 

	HEYWARD

	draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	His eyes see Munro. 

	WIDER & LOWER: MAGUA

	raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have
	been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... 

	WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

	FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive
	ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR
	of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... 

	SOLDIERS & CIVILIANS

	dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. 

	HAWKEYE

	is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where
	Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye
	shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the
	column ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the
	area in which he saw Munro. 

	CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,
	covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Right - about face! March! First rank present! 

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	REVERSE:

	The volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! 
			Present! 

	Hurons are twenty yards away and closing.

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... 

	WIDE: THE HILLS & PATH

	We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down
	from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and
	Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off
	views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.

	BRITISH TROOPERS

	using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog
	swirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... 

	MAGUA

	glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.
	He sees ... 

	BLONDE WOMAN

	hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman
	protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his
	tomahawk. On his downswing ... 

	HAWKEYE

	running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. 

					HAWKEYE
			Cora! 

	Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. 

	CORA & ALICE

	running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in
	struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in
	Cora's hand. 

	ONE HURON

	scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. 

	CORA

	shoots him in the face. 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE

	and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her
	expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her
	head. 

	HAWKEYE

	locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and
	comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand
	fires Killdeer at ... 

	HURON

	six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. 

	HAWKEYE

	free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in
	strange tableaux. Meanwhile: 

	MUNRO

	hollering

					MUNRO
			Cora! Alice! 

	He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An
	Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to
	stab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in
	an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires
	backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. 

	WIDER

	Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders over the deafening noise.

					HEYWARD
			Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! 
			Load! Third rank! Present! 

	A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting
	cut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect
	order. 

	HURON WARRIOR

	about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. 

	CLOSER: MAGUA

	His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. 

	OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO

	his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. 

					MAGUA
			Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your 
			living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, 
			know that I will put under the knife your 
			children and wipe your seed from this earth 
			forever ... 

	Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... 

	MOHAWK & HURON

	spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down
	and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with
	tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers
	fighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst
	bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. 

	CORA & ALICE

	in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a
	Fox warrior. Cora & Alice run. 

	MUNRO'S FACE

	frozen in agony by shock. 

	MAGUA

	reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into
	the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. 

	LONG SHOT: MAGUA

	seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. 

	REVERSE: HAWKEYE

	saw him and fights his way to attack when ... 

	WHITE HORSE

	crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm
	and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an
	Ottawa who's behind him. Then ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	up, looking wildly ... 

	CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:

	33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

					HEYWARD
			Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, 
			present! Rank two, hold! 

	He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.
	Men are dying. They're being pushed back. 

	AN ABNAKI

	wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the
	musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in
	the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.
	Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...

					HEYWARD
			Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, 
			present! 

	Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see
	what's wrong. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT

	are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last
	stand. Heyward straightens. 

	TWO FRENCH OFFICERS

	on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot
	by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.
	Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... 

	JESUIT

	pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers
	his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. 

	UNCAS

	sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling
	chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... 

	ALICE

	on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take
	her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases
	him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... 

	OTTAWA WARRIOR

	is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and
	Cora ... 

	TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR

	from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out
	 with bayonets and tomahawks. 

	HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &
	MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS

	back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the
	side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The
	Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger. 

	HAWKEYE

	shields Cora as they back up. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and
	shoots another. Then he sees ... 

	SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER

	It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. 

	THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,
	THE RANGER & THE MOHAWK

	back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to
	the canoes. 

	CORA

	held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. 

	ANGLE

	something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the
	shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. 

	WOUNDED RANGER

	has shoved a large birch canoe at them. 

	HAWKEYE

	Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands
	rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries
	to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring
	into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float
	away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY

	The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers
	tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of
	a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. 

	HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. 

	CLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA

	Cora looks left. Her eyes go wide. 

					CORA
			No! 

	HAWKEYE

	spins. 

	HEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE

	have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at
	Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. 

					HAWKEYE
			You got nothin' better to do today on 
			Lake George than shoot me, Major,
			then go ahead ... 

	Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and
	rounds come in. 

	WIDE

	They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. 

	HEYWARD

	is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays
	Heyward no heed.

					CORA
			Stop it!! 

	Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied
	around his leg. He lowers the gun. 

					HEYWARD
			When you fall into British hands again, 
			Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. 

	HURON CANOES

	paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. 

	HAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES

	with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &
	Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're
	sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. 

	HURON CANOES

	maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. 

	HAWKEYE'S CANOE

	Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.
	Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... 

					REDCOAT #1
			Can't ... keep it up ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Pull! 

	He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.

					HEYWARD
				(shouts)
			How long? 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Only chance we got is ... 
				(breathless)
			 ... to get more distance on 'em and go 
			to ground! 

	Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail
	of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls
	overboard.

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Pull!!

	HAWKEYE CANOE

	sprints forward. 

	CLOSE: HAWKEYE

	looks over his shoulder. 

	THE HURON CANOES

	They're pulling away from them.

					HAWKEYE
			Pull ...! 

	More Huron musket balls hit water nearby. 

	REDCOAT

	in Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The
	Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. 

					REDCOAT #2
			Spent. 

	Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore
	musket range. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE]

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Head for ... for the white water. 

					HEYWARD
			Do you hear me, sir! 
				(exhausted)
			If you ever fall ... into British hands ...
				(breathes)
			What white water? 

	HEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE

	divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE

	paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way
	ahead of the Hurons. 

	UNCAS

	leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes
	control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and
	Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes. 

	EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY

	The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. 

	CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE

	racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and
	they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. 

	HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. 

	UNCAS' CANOE

	Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do.
	As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe
	revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through 
	stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way
	through a hazard of ... 

	EXPOSED ROCKS

	jutting out of the water. 

	WIDE - BOTH CANOES

	Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to
	shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,
	Uncas swings it back around while ... 

	WHITE WATER

	smashes into the camera. 

	ALICE & CORA

	as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and
	the water is miraculously smooth. 

	CANOES

	The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's
	because they think they're home free.

					HAWKEYE
			Here's where it gets tricky ... 

	Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's
	talking about. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD

	looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:
	something's wrong with this picture. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

	The look on his face starts to change. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER

	The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The
	river just ends ... 

	BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER

	realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of
	rock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.

					HAWKEYE
			Don't move ... 

	AERIAL SHOT

	from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.
	The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. 

	TWO CANOES

	At the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock
	outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. 

	HEYWARD

	grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for
	the edge. 

	UNCAS

	lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,
	with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to
	the rock. He gestures to Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe
	rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... 

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND

	Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As
	they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into
	a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps
	Alice ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT

	The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of
	Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.

					HEYWARD
			Where do we go from here? 

					HAWKEYE
			We don't. 

					HEYWARD
			I don't understand! 

					HAWKEYE
			This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're 
			lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have 
			come this way and must've beached our 
			canoes and headed cross land. If we're 
			very lucky, they'll figure we went over 
			the falls. 

					HEYWARD
			Then what? 

					HAWKEYE
			Then we take the south rim down the 
			mountain and it's 12 miles cross country 
			to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			And if we're unlucky? 

					HAWKEYE
			You will have to forego the pleasure of 
			hangin' me. 

	REVERSE: WIDE

	Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the
	rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS

	are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the
	formation was part of the falls. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. 

	WIDEN TO REVEAL

	a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down
	its height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're
	exhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have
	almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,
	the paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In
	Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward
	approaches Hawkeye.

					HEYWARD
			Any powder? 

					HAWKEYE:
				(crossing to Cora)
			Only one or two loads. 

	CORA

	is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.
	Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. 

					CORA
			Are we safe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Maybe ... 

					CORA
			Our father? Did you see my father? 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE

	The look on his face tells it all 

					CORA
			Tell me! 

	TWO SHOT

	Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers
	to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over
	her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. 

	HAWKEYE

	Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries
	softly into his shoulder. 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA

	says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...

					CORA
			Say nothing to Alice ...! 

	Hawkeye nods.

	ALICE

	stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's
	oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... 

	HEYWARD

	sees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. 

	GROUP

	Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is
	exhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -
	TWILIGHT

	A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the
	mountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white
	highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the
	surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and
	muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.
	He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen
	Falls island. 

	HURON

	looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT

	watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. 

	OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES

	join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as
	his eyes go white reflecting the new moon. 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT

	hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling
	water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances
	with Uncas & Chingachgook. 

	UNCAS

	immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves
	carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. 

	HAWKEYE

	His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He
	touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. 

	ALICE

	sensing new danger, slips away on her own. 

	CORA

	crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do
	a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... 

	NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS

	against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... 

	ALICE

	looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight
	pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.
	Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the
	edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she
	was seen. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.
	Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,
	as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. 

	ALICE'S

	eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto
	Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his
	chest. 

					ALICE
			Uncas ... 

	Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let
	him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,
	she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name
	and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. 

	UNCAS

	his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some
	emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and
	holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He
	reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her
	face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. 

	WIDER ANGLE

	She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT

	beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:
	green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed
	to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his
	musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us
	approaching the island, two hundred yards away ...

	been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no
	way out.

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT

	Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen
	on Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.
	Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye
	agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has
	understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.

					CORA
			Yes. Go ahead. 

					HEYWARD
				(explodes)
			What the bloody hell plan is this? 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Cora)
			In this there is a chance. If I live, I can 
			try to free you. If we don't go, there is 
			no powder, there's too many of them. 
			Though my heart would keep me here, 
			in that there is no chance. None. I can do 
			nothing. Do you understand? 

					CORA
			Yes. I want you to go. 

					HEYWARD
			Coward! Coward back at the fort. 
			Coward here. 

	Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. 

					CORA
			You try. With all you have. To save 
			yourself. If the worst happens, and 
			only one of us survives, something of

	CUT TO ...

	She's holding him. In the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear. 

					HAWKEYE
				(very close)
			 If they don't kill you, they may take you 
			north up into Canada. A warrior may take 
			you for a wife. 

	CORA

	turns aside. Hawkeye insists. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continues)
			Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're

					CORA
				(nods, low)
			 ... never doubt what you are doing. 

	RANGER

	conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come
	the attack as ... 

	HEYWARD

	puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor of the cave. Now the
	first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls. They're coming ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. Uncas spins
	looks at Alice: her expression's vacant. 

	HAWKEYE'S KNIFE

	cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange light from Huron
	torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. We hear many Huron approach. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water. This is their
	exit. 

	HAWKEYE

	engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor
	towards the water ... 

	WHAT HAWKEYE SEES: JAMMING AT THE WATERFALL

	and then through it into ... 

	SUBJECTIVE CAMERA: UP

	An awful crushing roar. We explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way
	from the top and we fall down away from the world. 

	EXTERIOR GLEN FALLS - HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; then through air;
	then back into cascading white water again, disappearing ... 

	THE RIVER BELOW - UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK'S

	bodies hit, disappear and don't surface. It looks unsurviveable. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FALLING

	Sheets of water fall with us. The bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour ...
	Just before we hit ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - FLAMING TORCH - NIGHT

	WIDEN. The cave is filled with Hurons. The Redcoat is dead in the corner. A group of
	braves moves away from the body of the Ranger. 

	HEYWARD'S

	surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is
	clubbed down by a giant. 

	MAGUA

	enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. He's
	imperturbable. 

	MAGUA'S HAND

	reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. His hand drops away
	from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and
	the two women are jerked towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - WHITE WATER - NIGHT

	miles from the falls. We see a figure. It's Chingachgook, nearly spent, rolling and
	tumbling through the fast-moving white water. He submerges, then surfaces again. He
	appears exhausted by the fall and ride. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER

	rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming
	against the current. He's grabbing for something. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries
	to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They
	pull the older, larger man from the water and ... 

	ON THE ROCK

	all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others.
	Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy
	between the rock they landed on and the shoreline. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HURONS - DAY

	move along animal paths. 

	CORA & ALICE

	struggle through the branches of trees. No one helps them. When they fall behind, they
	are pushed forward. 

	HEYWARD

	badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:

					HEYWARD
			If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers 
			... will receive many gifts. 

					MAGUA
				(as if considering)
			Gifts? 

					HEYWARD
			Three, four oxen ... much wampum. 

					MAGUA
			Wampum? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Does Yengeese Major have property 
			across salt sea? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. 
			Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, 
			many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. 

	Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot?

					HEYWARD
			Gold could be arranged. 

					MAGUA
			For Munro children? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			How much gold has the master of the 
			Yengeese? 

					HEYWARD
			The King? The King has mountains of 
			gold! 

	Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this 	transaction.

					MAGUA
			Not enough. 

	Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.

					HEYWARD
			What is enough? 

					MAGUA
			Heart. Give Magua new heart. 

	Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, starting up a steeper
	forested hill.

	CUT TO ...

	EXT. HURON VILLAGE - ORNATE CHAIR - DAY

	on a rude platform. The entire village is crowded in a large circle. They all wait for
	someone. They've been waiting a long time. In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at
	bay for some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ... 

	ANCIENT SACHEM

	is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch
	bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the
	raised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by
	his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He
	wears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.
	Most startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of
	tatooing. He looks up to Magua. 

					SACHEM
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			The tomahawks of your young men have 
			been very red. 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			Many of the Yengeese are dead, great 
			Sachem. 
				(sound dissolve to English)
			I have brought three of my prisoners, 
			to honor you. Two are the children
			of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my 
			lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from 
			his chest. 

	Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat & fear are held in place by her determination.
	Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's hands are bound between his back with
	a piece of wood wedged through his elbows.

			officer to Les Francais and the reward is 
			my gift to you, wise one ... The women - 
			children of the white war chief - will burn 
			in our fires so all can share in this. 

	The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua. 

	MAGUA

	senses the sachem's eye line ... 

	HAWKEYE

	unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. Hawkeye, at the
	last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain the boy. The Hurons are
	astounded a European would simply walk into their camp. 

	CORA

	sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there. 

					CORA
			Nathaniel! 

	Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to
	go off.
					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward; low)
			Translate for me, Major. Into French. 
			Every word ... as I say it. 

	Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			I come to you unarmed and in peace to 
			unstop your ears, wise one. Because the 
			Hurons are mislead by the words of the 
			wolf who's never spoken the truth.

	Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on
	Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's
	English.

					HAWKEYE
			Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro 
			go free and take the fire out of the English 
			anger over the murder of their helpless ones. 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the 
			Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron 
			do not fear English anger. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Wise one, the French fathers made peace 
			and swore to their honor not to break the 
			friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that 
			the French would not be friends, still, to 
			the Huron. 

	Sachem reacts.

					MAGUA
				(laughs)
			It made our French father happy to never 
			have to fight the same Yengeese again. 
			He told me this without telling me this. 

	Hawkeye realizes this is true.

					HAWKEYE
			So the Huron are the servants of the French? 
			To do what the French are shamed to do? 

					MAGUA
			No. 
				(to Sachem)
			Huron serve no one. The French father 
			believes he fooled Magua because he is so 
			proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it 
			is the Huron path that Magua walks down, 
			not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, 
			also, fear Huron. That is good. When the 
			Huron is strong from their fear, we will make 
			the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we 
			will trade as the white man trades. Take land 
			from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk 
			& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over 
			other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong 
			as the whites. 

	Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Magua would use the ways of Les Francais 
			and the Yengeese ... 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			The red man put down the bow, picked up 
			the fire stick and became the best warrior 
			in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. 

					HAWKEYE
			Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers 
			foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell 
			them for gold to the white man? Would the 
			Huron have greed for more land than a man 
			can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? 
			Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would 
			the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the 
			animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But 
			sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... 
				(to Sachem)
			 Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les 
			Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron 
			men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? 
			... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make 
			himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become 
			Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? 
			... Magua's way is false. It is like the white 
			sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness 
			and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. 
				(pauses)
			I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, 
			adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican 
			people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go 
			free ... I speak the truth. 

	Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem
	whispers to the older men on either side of him. 

	MAGUA

	waits for the decision. 

	CORA

	looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him
	from the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments. Then ... to every word. 

					SACHEM
			The white man comes like a day that has 
			passed. And night enters our future with 
			him ... 
				(pause)
			Our council talks since I was a boy: 
			What is the Huron to do? 
				(pause)
			But Magua would lead Huron down paths 
			that make us not Hurons. 
				(the judgment)
			Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted 
			heart of Magua. 

	Cora, hearing the sentence ... Hawkeye's losing her.

					SACHEM
				(continuing)
			Munro daughter with moon in her hair 
			must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed 
			doesn't die. 

	Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind.

					SACHEM
				(continuing; dissolves 
				back to French)
			 ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les
			Francais, but back to Yengeese so their 
			hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, 
			go in peace. 

	People move, start to implement the sentence. Hawkeye's panicked. Cora is jerked
	upright. She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is starting to depart.

					HAWKEYE
			No! listen. 
				(to Heyward)
			Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!! 

	Heyward translates into rapid-fire French. 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a 
			great honor to the Huron. Take me! 

	Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He
	knocks her aside. Chaos & confusion. Meanwhile: 

					MAGUA
				(French; subtitled)
			This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to 
			the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. 
			Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, 
			beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. 
			Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you! 

	Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard
	core braves start out as ... 

	SACHEM

	heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods
	his head. 

	HAWKEYE

	sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit.
	Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown at him. Cora looks around wildly.
	Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's caught under the arms
	and dragged forward.

					HAWKEYE
			I said to trade me! 

	Hawkeye's holding Cora. Heyward struggles to be seen.

					HEYWARD
			... compliments, Mr. Poe. 
				(pause)
			Take her and get out. 

					CORA
				(standing)
			What are they doing to Duncan? 
			Duncan! 

	He's gone. They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons.

					HAWKEYE 
				(low to himself)
			And my compliments to you ... 

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will the Sachem's
	judgment be honored? Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye & Cora? As they go ... 

	CORA

	moves towards her sister. But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. 

	CORA'S POV: ALICE

	with Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She
	regains her feet. Magua is oblivious to her. He's heading towards the plateau. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS - DAY

	Uncas sees Magua's direction. Uncas touches his father, grabs his musket and races off.
	Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but he's too late. Chingachgook's hand in the air ... 

	TWO-SHOT: HAWKEYE & CORA

	near the tree line. Hawkeye has eyes only for ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS

	moving towards fire pit. One turns to watch Hawkeye & Cora depart. Will he arouse
	others to attack? Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap
	up. 

	CORA'S EYES

	are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. 

	HAWKEYE

	tense. They're almost there. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	holding Killdeer. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON

	Sky & flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by
	his arms. As the flames start devouring him ... 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	close to Chingachgook and the tree line ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he FIRES. 

	HEYWARD

	among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead. It goes unnoticed. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS - DAY

	half-way up the rock face. He's approaching an overhang. He climbs with a reckless
	desperation ... 

	EXTERIOR STREAM - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path ... 

	CORA

	trying to stay with them, scrambles up ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	reaches the overhang. It juts away from the face six feet. 

	THE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG

	Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.
	He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand
	reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ... 

	UNCAS' HAND

	... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... 

	UNCAS

	swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are
	distorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.
	His arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY

	on point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of
	Magua. One behind him drags Alice. 

	FIRST

	Huron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. 

	WIDE ANGLE

	Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets
	Three. 

	FOURTH

	FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'
	musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the
	edge ... 

	MAGUA

	running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. 

	UNCAS'

	three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver
	flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open
	hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.
	Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'
	right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like
	Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. 

	EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK

	freezes. 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	closing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,
	ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. 

	CLOSE: MAGUA'S

	knife arm punches forward. 

	WIDE: PROMONTORY

	Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	seeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following. 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE

	backs to the edge. 

	MAGUA

	moves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like
	pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... 

	MAGUA

	inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of
	something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his
	other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... 

	ALICE

	looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with
	enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her
	death next to Uncas ... 

	EXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA

	collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... 

	HURON WARRIORS

	are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a
	father's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest ... 

	HAWKEYE

	FIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. Hawkeye races to reload
	on the run ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA

	sees the approach of Chingachgook. 

	TO CHINGACHGOOK

	Huron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his musket. 

	HAWKEYE FIRES. 

	HURON

	with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. 

	MAGUA

	charging Chingachgook. 

	VERY WIDE

	Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall
	back... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... 

	COMBATANTS

	Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his
	right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to
	gut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	isn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.
	The massive war club crashes into Magua's back. 

	MAGUA

	stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
	 breaking Magua's right arm. And ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
	side and crushes part of his chest. 

	ANOTHER BLOW

	destroys Magua's collar and shoulder. 

	MAGUA

	amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of
	the last warrior of the Mohicans. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			UNCAS!!! 

	And he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,
	caving him in two. 

	WIDE

	Magua dies in the dust. 

	HAWKEYE

	watching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. 

	CORA

	alone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... 

	FADE OUT ...

	FADE IN 

	EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY

	Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of
	sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK

	speaks to the sky.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican)
			Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... 

	ON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	We HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: 

					CHINGACHGOOK/
					HAWKEYE (V.O.): 
				(in English)
			... a warrior goes to you swift and straight 
			as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him 
			and let him take his place at the council fire 
			of my people. 
				(pause)
			He is Uncas, my son. 
				(pause)
			Bid them patience and ask death for speed; 
			for they are all there but one
			- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. 

	Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His
	eyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... 

	CORA

	is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next
	to it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses
	herself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA]

					HAWKEYE
			Will you go back to England? 

					CORA
			I have nothing to go back for. 

	Long pause. 

					HAWKEYE
			Then will you stay in America? 

	She turns to face him.

					HAWKEYE
			And will you be my wife? 

	Pause. 

					CORA
			Yes. 

	They hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.

					CORA
			Where will we go? 

					HAWKEYE
			Winter with the Delaware, my father's 
			cousins. And in the spring, cross the 
			Ohio and look for land to settle with my 
			father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. 

	They move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is
	around her shoulders.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			The frontier moves with the sun and pushes 
			the red man of the wilderness forests in front 
			of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. 
			Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... 
			The frontier place is for people like my white 
			son and his woman and their children. 

					HAWKEYE
			That's my father's sadness talking. 

	Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no 
			more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. 
			Like the Mohicans. 
				(pause)
			And new people will come. Work. Struggle 
			to make their light ... One mystery remains. 

					HAWKEYE
			What is that? 

	Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Will there be anything left to show the world 
			that we ever did exist? 

	REAR SHOT

	Cora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. They stare out
	over the wilderness.

          EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
                         
          PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.
          He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a
          train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.
                         
          He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.
                         
                          PAUL
                          (ENGLISH)
           FUCKING GOD!!!!
                         
          As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a
          private WORLD OF PAIN.
                         
          Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
          hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
                         
          As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
          HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
                         
          He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
                         
          She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
          walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
                         
          We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
          he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.

          Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
          RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.
          She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.
                         
          She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.
                         
          She goes into a BAR.

           A phone token, please.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           No tokens. At the end, on the left.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Thank you.
                         
          Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM.
                         
          The telephone booth is OCCUPIED.
                         
          As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans
          her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her
          mouth.
                         
          Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks
          up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth,
          still LOST IN ANGUISH.
                         
          After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She
          speaks to her MOM.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found
           a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going
           to see it.
                         
          She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as
          her SHORT SKIRT hikes up.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Then I've got to go to the station
           to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see

          Jeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW
          who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I've come to see the flat. I saw
           the sign.
                         
                          CONCIERGE

           Yes.
                         
          The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           It's always the same! Nobody ever
           tells me anything.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'd like to see it.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           You want to rent it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know yet!
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           They rent, they leave and I'm the
           last to know. Do you think that's
           right?
                         
          She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           If you want to go up alone--
                         
          She looks through her KEYS...
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           Go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The
           key is missing. Strange things
           happen.
          One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside
          their door. They both TAKE NOTICE.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           They drink six bottles a day.
                         
          Jeanne thinks the place is like a FUNNY FARM. As the
          concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           Wait! Don't go! There must be a
           duplicate.
                         
          She looks for it.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)

          Jeanne, against her better judgement, goes back to the desk.
          She holds out her hand. The Concierge puts the KEY IN HER
          HAND.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           You must be very young.
                         
          She GRABS AND HOLDS ON to Jeanne's hand way too long,
          LAUGHING CRAZY, HYSTERICAL. Jeanne has to forcefully break
          away from her grasp.

           Let go of me!
                         
          She gets free of her and heads to the ELEVATOR, rubbing her
          hand.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           She's crazy!
                         
          The ELEVATOR arrives and she gets on. We watch her ascend and
          DISAPPEAR.

          Jeanne comes in the DARK ROOM and heads straight for the
          window. She opens it and the STORM SHUTTER.
                         
          Light STREAMS IN, revealing Paul, sitting on the RADIATOR.
                         
          Jeanne is STARTLED when she sees him.
          DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH

          No response.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           You gave me a fright.
                         
          No response.

          He replies WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER.

           Through the door.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't
           hear you come in.
                         
                          PAUL
           I was already here.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I
           had to bribe the concierge. These
           old houses are fascinating.
                         
          She walks up to the FIREPLACE.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           An armchair by the fireplace would
           look good.
                         
                          PAUL
           The armchair should go in front of
           the window.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Are you American? You've got an
           American accent.
                         
          He gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for
          SOLITUDE.

          But she has followed him. She OPENS THOSE WINDOWS also. He is
          forced into ANOTHER ROOM.

          other room.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Are you going to take it? Are you?
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know.
                         
          She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the
          best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT
          IN THE CORNER.

           What are you doing?
                         
          She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade.

          As the PHONE RINGS, she pulls up her skirt and sits on the
          toilet for a PEE. She looks around.
                         
          She finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON
          incessantly.

          They pick up the phone at the SAME TIME. Paul EAVES DROPS
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE

           Hello -- Hello. There's no-one
           here. There's no-one. I don't know.
          He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on
          the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her
          end, UNAWARE.
                         
          Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER.

          Jeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you're going to take it? You've
           decided?
                         
                          PAUL
           I had already decided. But I'm not
           sure now. Do you like it?
                         
          She's SPEECHLESS.

                          JEANNE
           I don't know. I shall have to think
           about it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Think fast.
                         
          He WALKS OFF.
                         
          Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION.
                         
          The front door SLAMS.
                         
          She walks toward the door...
                         
          But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I thought you'd left.
                         
          He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on
          the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the
          window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start
          MAKING OUT ferociously.
                         
          He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER.
          They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around
          him.
                         
                          PAUL
           Ah... Oh, God.
                         
          They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh, Jesus... Oh... Oh, Christ.
                         
          Totally spent, they ROLL AWAY from each other. Her skirt,
          hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose. We can see her
          AMPLE BUSH through the SHEER FABRIC.
                         
          They WRITHE on the floor trying to CATCH THEIR BREATH.

          He watches her descend the stairs and throws the CRUMPLED UP

          Jeanne RUNS through the crowd IN A PANIC dodging people. She
          finds who she is LOOKING FOR, her boyfriend TOM (30's). She
          runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.
                         
          All of the sudden, a FILM CREW appears, filming their every
          moment.
                         
          They KISS PASSIONATELY.
                         
          Tom tries to UNTANGLE HER from the cords.

           We're in a film.
                         
          He walks her and EXPLAINS.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           We're in a film. If I kiss you...

           Yeah, but I wanted...
                         
          Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.

           I wanted to start with shots of

           fiancé. Yes, I know them. They're

                          JEANNE
           So you kissed me, and you knew it
           was being filmed. You're a bastard!
           Traitor!
                         
                          TOM
           No, you'll see. It will be a love
           story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling.
           What did you do while I was away?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I thought of you day and night, and
           I cried. Darling, I can't live
           without you!

          He is THRILLED. He tries to kiss her but she won't let him.
          She is still MIFFED. But she finally GIVES IN. They have a

          She WRINGS OUT a washcloth frequently as she speaks. The
          EXCESSIVE BLOOD AND WATER falling into a BUCKET.
                         
                          CATHERINE
           I'd have finished by now, but the
           police wouldn't let me touch
           anything. They didn't believe it
           was suicide.
                         
          She WIPES A MIRROR.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           There was so much blood everywhere.
           They had fun making me do a
           reconstruction. "She went there."
                         
          She wipes another GLASS SURFACE.

           "She opened the curtain."
                         
          She STARES at the blood... It's so much. She uses the SHOWER
          HEAD to rinse the blood off the tub.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           I copied all her actions. The
           guests were awake all night! The
           hotel was crawling with cops! They
           enjoy playing around with blood.
          She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           They were all spies! Asking if she
           was sad, if she was happy, if you
           fought, how long you'd been
           married, why you didn't have any
           children. Pigs!
                         
          Disgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. We
          switch to PAUL'S SIDE of the PRIVACY SCREEN. We see he is
          DEEPLY DISTURBED by this situation.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           They got familiar right away! They
           said, "Your boss is a bit
           unstable." "Do you know that he was
           a boxer?" So?

           11.
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           "It didn't work out, so he became
           an actor." "Bongo player,
           revolutionary in South America,
           journalist in Japan."
                         
          She begins to clean blood from THE STRAIGHT RAZOR Paul's wife
          used to KILL HERSELF WITH.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           One day, he lands in Tahiti, hangs
           around, Learns French." "Then he
           comes to Paris. There... he meets a
           woman with money, marries her
           and... "Since then what has your
           boss done?" "Nothing."
                         
          Paul pulls the curtains aside from the window. He looks out.
          He SPIES a BLACK COUPLE, one a SAX PLAYER, in an adjacent
          building. She is attempting ORAL SEX on him.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           I say, "Can I clean up now?" "No!
           Don't touch anything!" "Do you
           really think she killed herself?"
           He pushed me into a corner and
           tried to paw me...
                         
          When the couple are spotted, they stop. He starts PLAYING HIS
          SAX.
                         
          Paul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning.
                         
                          PAUL
           Turn the tap off now.
                          CATHERINE
           They'll be doing the autopsy right
           now.
                         
          Paul walks to her side.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why won't you turn the tap off?
                         
                          CATHERINE
           They told me to give you your razor
           back.
                         
          She hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT.
                         
                          PAUL
           It's not mine.

                          CATHERINE
           They said they don't need it any
           more. The investigation is over.
                         
          He grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           Yes, she had cuts there...
                         
          He tilts her head back FORCEFULLY.
                         
                          CATHERINE (CONT'D)
           ... and on the neck, too...
                         
          He PULLS HER OUT OF THE WAY and turns off the water. He pulls
          the SHOWER CURTAIN closed.
                         
          He storms out of the bathroom, leaving Catherine there.
                         
          When he is gone, she opens the curtain and turns the water
          back on OUT OF SPITE.

          The front door opens and Jeanne's hand comes in, holding the
          KEY.
                         
          The rest of her peeks in. She SPIES A CAT. She decides to
          make CRAZY NOISES at the animal, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR,
          making it RUN FOR THE HILLS.
                         
          Just then, MOVERS pop in carrying furniture catching Jeanne
          off guard.
                         
                          MOVER
           Excuse me, where shall I put this?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You could have rung the bell.
           13.
                         
                         
                          MOVER
           The door was open. I'll put it
           there.
                         
          He puts the chair down in the middle of the room. She moves
          it to in front of the fireplace instead.
                         
                          JEANNE
           In front of the fireplace.
                         
          She heads to the front door but is stopped by...
                         
                          MOVER 2
           Careful, madame.
                         
          With and armfull of chairs.
                         
                          JEANNE
           There.
                         
          She tries to leave again but then runs into...
                         
                          MOVER
           What about the table?
                         
          With a table.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How do I know? He'll decide.

           This is a king-size.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It won't fit!
                         
                          MOVER
           Well, your husband has no idea. All
           this in an hour... It's not long.
                         
          She leans against a wall and looks around, FLABBERGASTED.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What a mess!
                         
          We see Paul in the DOORWAY paying the movers.

          LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne is sitting in the chair in front of the fire place.
                         
                          PAUL
           The armchair goes in front of the
           window.
                         
          He DRAGS THE CHAIR AND HER to the window instead.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Like that.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I only came to return the key.
           To return it to you.
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't care about the key. Take
           your coat off.
                         
          He takes his COAT OFF and hangs it on a DOOR HANDLE.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Take your coat off and help me.
                         
                          JEANNE

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Put them on the other side. Take
           that, too. That's it.

          against the wall STUDYING THE ROOM.
                         
                          PAUL
           The bed is too big for the room.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know what to call you.

           No, no! I don't. I don't want to
           know your name.
                         
          He COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL.

           You don't have a name and I don't
           have a name either. Not one name.
          She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them.

           Maybe I am, but I don't want to
           know anything about you. I don't
           wanna know where you live or where

           on outside here.
                         
          He indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

                          PAUL
           Because... Because we don't need
           names here. Don't you see? We're
           gonna forget... everything that we
           knew. Every... All the people,...
           all that we do,... wherever we
           live. We're going to forget that,
           everything, everything.

          ROSA'S MOTHER roots through Paul and Rosa's belongings.
          Searching for answers... and maybe some tokens of her
          DECEASED DAUGHTER.
                         
          Paul WAITS, listening in the HALLWAY. He loathes the upcoming
          reunion.
                         
          ANNOYED by all the RATTLING while she searches, he bites the
          bullet and GOES IN.
                         
          He CATCHES her in the ARMOIRE...
                         
          She stops her ROOTING.
           17.
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I thought you'd be here.
                         
                          PAUL
           I expected you later.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I took the first train.
                         
          We notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads "PRIVY"
          (PRIVATE).
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful,
           Paul!
                         
          She walks TIMIDLY up to Paul. After a moment, they EMBRACE
          each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG.
                         
                         MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Paul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the
          closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the
          DECOR and her silly hat.
                         
          She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY
          SESSION.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Papa is in bed with asthma. The
           doctor wouldn't let him come. It's
           better like that. I'm stronger.
                         
          She starts RUMMAGING AGAIN, this time through Rosa's empty
          PURSES, spilling them out one at a time on the bed BEHIND
          PAUL.
                         
                          PAUL
           What are you looking for?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Something that would explain... A
           letter, a clue.
                         
                          PAUL
           Nothing. I told you, there's
           nothing, nothing at all.
                         
          He takes the purses and PUTS THEM BACK. She sits on the bed
          in DESPAIR.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           My little Rosa wouldn't have...
           Nothing for her mother. Not a word.
           18.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           It's useless to keep on searching.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Not even for you, her husband!
                         
          He closes the ARMOIRE.
                         
                          PAUL
           You need to rest. I think room
           12 is free.
                         
          He GATHERS HER BELONGINGS and leads her UP THE STAIRS.
                         
          STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They pass some GUESTS coming down.
                         
                          GUEST
           Hi.
                         
          Rosa's Mother stops on the stairway, REFLECTING PAINFULLY.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           With a razor?
                         
          Paul goes on, IGNORING HER.
                         
          ROOM 12 - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Paul comes in and puts her belongings on the BED.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           What time did it happen?
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know. In the evening.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           And then?
                         
                          PAUL
           Then I... I already told you on the
           phone... When I found her, I called
           the ambulance.
                         
          Paul goes out to the HALLWAY to gather himself.
           19.
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           After you called, Papa and I stayed
           up all night, talking about Rosa
           and you. Papa kept whispering, as
           if it had happened in our house.
                         
          Rosa's mother thinks he LEFT. She YELLS.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Paul!
                         
          Paul is BROKEN OUT OF HIS TRANCE... the sudden yelling has
          INCENSED HIM.
                         
          He PEERS ANGRILY at her in room 12.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           Where did it happen?
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           In one of the rooms.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Did she suffer?
                         
                          PAUL
           Ask the Doctors. They're doing the
           autopsy.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           The autopsy.
                         
          He goes into the ...
          BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He turns off the ANNOYING RUNNING WATER. He looks at himself
          in the mirror.
                         
          She UNPACKS her suitcases on her bed. He rejoins her.
                         
          ROOM 12 - CONTINUOUS
                         
          She takes out some CARDS.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           I already had some announcement
           cards. I've seen a lot of death. I
           think of everything. I'll prepare
           her a beautiful room with flowers.
           20.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           The cards, clothes, relatives,
           flowers. You've got everything in
           that suitcase. You didn't forget
           anything. But I don't want any
           priests here.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           But...
                         
                          PAUL
           No priests.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           But Paul...
                         
                          PAUL
           Understand?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           We have to. Funerals must be
           religious.
                         
          Paul EXPLODES -- She jumps a foot back.
                         
                          PAUL
           No!!!
                         
          He DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Rosa didn't believe! Nobody
           believes in the fucking God here!
                         
          He throws her suitcase AGAINST THE WALL.
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Paul, don't shout. Don't talk like
           that.
                         
          He SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           The priest doesn't want any
           suicides. The Church doesn't want
           any suicides, do they?
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           They'll give her absolution.
                         
          He RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Heh!?
           21.
                         
                         
          Scared, she pushes on.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Absolution and a nice mass. That's
           all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my
           little girl, do you understand?
           Rosa... Why did she kill herself?
                         
          She starts WEEPING.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why? Why did she commit suicide?
           Why?
                         
          He PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists ... ENRAGED...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You don't know? You don't know.
                         
          He closes her DOOR.
                         
          HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Some of the OTHER GUESTS pop their heads out to see what the
          COMMOTION IS. He gently CLOSES THEIR DOORS in a "mind your
          own business" sort of way.
                         
          There is always the "Miss know it all, busybody type" though.
                         
          She sheepishly REOPENS HER DOOR.
                         
          Paul walks calmly back to it and SLAMS IT in her face ---
          IRATE.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Jeanne enters the ALREADY OPEN DOOR. She looks around the
          still sparsely furnished living room.
                         
          LIVING ROOM -
                         
          Paul has decided his BED FITS BETTER in here. The BOTTOM
          MATTRESS is on the floor in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. He LEANS
          AGAINST THE WALL and top mattress, WAITING FOR JEANNE. He
          knew she'd be there.
                         
          She TAKES A SEAT on the bottom mattress and takes off her
          boots.
                         
          He watches her and does the same with his shoes. KICKING THEM
          OFF and CATCHING THEM in the air PLAYFULLY.
           22.
                         
                         
                         LATER
                         
          Paul and Jeanne sit NUDE, entwined, WRAPPED AROUND EACH
          OTHERS BODY'S.
                         
          DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH
                         
                          PAUL
           OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just
           look at each other.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's beautiful without knowing
           anything.
                         
          They REGARD each other for seconds.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Maybe... Maybe we can come without
           touching.
                         
                          PAUL
           Come without touching? OK.
                         
          He leans his head back and CLOSES his eyes... SCREWING UP HIS
          FACE. She COPIES HIM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Are you concentrating? Did you come
           yet?
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. It's difficult!
                          PAUL
           I didn't either yet. You're not
           trying hard enough.
                         
          They STOP THE SILLINESS. They laugh. She wraps her arms
          around his neck.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I shall have to invent a name for
           you.
                         
                          PAUL
           A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God,
           I've been called by a million names
           all my life. I don't want a name.
           I'm better off with a grunt or a
           groan for a name. Do you wanna hear
           my name?
           23.
                         
                         
          Paul does some PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS. APE SOUNDING GRUNTS and
          such. He contorts his face and LOOKS SILLY.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's so masculine.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Listen to mine.
                         
          She mimics his idea and makes her own PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS.
          He laughs.
                         
                          PAUL
           I didn't get the last name.
                         
          She redoes the SOUNDS for him. He JOINS her. Their ANIMAL
          SOUNDS BLEED INTO...

          Tom and his FILM CREW record the ducks for b.g. SOUND CLIPS
          while they WAIT FOR JEANNE.
                         
          This includes ROOSTERS, PIGEONS and annoyed NAIL FILING by
          one of the CREW.
                         
          FINALLY, Jeanne opens the gate door, sheepishly. She is LATE
          and has a DIFFERENT HAIR STYLE.
                         
          Tom is MIFFED, for continuity sake...
                         
          DIALOGUE IS FRENCH
                         
                          TOM
           You shouldn't have done that to me.
                         
          She is much more EXCITED about the NEW PERM.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's not a wig, it's my hair.
                         
          She CLOSES THE GATE.
                         
           Doesn't it suit me? Tell me, don't
           you like it? Tell me.
           24.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           Of course I like it. Listen, you
           know... I don't know. You have
           changed, and yet you haven't. I can
           see the shot now.
                         
          He twirls around, setting up the shot between his hands and
          his MINDS EYE...
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           The camera is up high. It descends
           slowly and follows you. You come
           forward, and it moves in on you.
           There's music, too. It gets closer
           and closer to you.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm in a hurry. Let's start.
                         
          She MOSEYS OFF.
                         
                          TOM
           But... can't we talk a little
           first?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Tonight we improvise. You follow.
                         
          He does.

          Jeanne kneels in front of a HEAD STONE that reads "Mustapha".
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           He was my childhood friend. He used
           to watch me for hours and hours. I
           think he understood me.
                         
          A VOICE from behind Jeanne pipes in.
                         
                          OLYMPIA'S VOICE
           Dogs are worth more than people.
           Much more.
                         
          Jeanne smiles, FAMILIAR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Meet Olympia, my nanny.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           Mustapha could always tell the poor
           from the rich.

           If someone well-dressed came in, he
           never stirred. But if someone
           scruffy came in, you should have
           seen him! What a dog!
           The colonel trained him to
           recognise Arabs by their scent.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Olympia, open the front door.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           Give me a kiss.
                         
          Jeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Go and open it.
                          (TO TOM)
           Olympia is a compendium of domestic
           virtues. Faithful, admiring, and
           racist.
                         
          We watch Olympia walk to the MANOR HOUSE as Jeanne WAXES
          NOSTALGIC. Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to
          us.
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           After Papa died, we moved back to
           the family home for a while. My
           childhood was made up of smells.
           Musty smells, the smell of walls
           and rooms.
                         
          A GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard.
           Children used to come and play in
           my jungle, all day long. Growing
           old is a crime.

          Jeanne holds up a PICTURE. She points to people as she
          describes them.
                         
                          JEANNE
           That's me there. And that's
           Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher.
           She was very strict... and very
           religious.
                         
          Olympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW.
           26.
                         
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           She was too good. She spoilt you.
                         
          The Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a
          DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           That's Christine...
                         
          They turn back to Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           ...my best friend. She married the
           pharmacist and has two children.
           It's like a village here. We all
           know each other.
                         
          Olympia chimes in again from behind, in an open door.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           I couldn't live in Paris.
                         
          The camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We're safe here. It's odd looking
           at the past.
                         
                          TOM
           Cut!
                         
          He walks to her.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Why is it odd? It's you! It's
           fantastic, it's your childhood.
           It's everything I was looking for.
                         
          He turns on his camera crew who is UNDER HIS HEELS, shewing
          them out.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           What are you up to? Move it! Move
           it!
           (to the lead crewman)
           Who are these zombies who are
           always following you around?
           (to all of them)
           Scoot! Go on! The door, the door...
                         
          He starts opening all the doors in the MANOR.
           27.
                         
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I'm opening the door. I'm opening
           all the doors.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          TOM
           Setting up my shot. There it is!
           That's it! I've found it. Reverse
           gear!
                         
          Olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine
          her nerve, in her own house!
                         
          Tom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR.

           What are you doing there? Beat it!
                         
          He turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his
          OBSESSION.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           That's it. Into reverse. Yes! Do
           you see? Like a car, you go into
           reverse gear. That's it. Close your
           eyes.
                         
          She closes her eyes. He guides her BACKWARDS by the shoulders
          through the MANOR.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Start reversing. Close your eyes.
           That's it, come on. Come on
           backwards. That's it. Go back to
           your childhood.
                         
          Jeanne BACKS TO a ROW OF PICTURES. She touches each and
          recalls the subject.

           Who?
                         
                          JEANNE
           My cousin Paul. My first love.
                         
                          TOM
           But his eyes are closed.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What?
                         
                          TOM
           His eyes are closed!
                          JEANNE
           He played the piano divinely.
           That's how I remember him...
                         
          AS WE --

          Jeanne and Tom walk BUNDLED TOGETHER as Jeanne REMINISCES...
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Sitting at the piano... His fingers
           would skim the keys.
                         
          The FILM CREW follow them, filming.
           30.
                         
                         
          Olympia stumbles behind, watching.
                         
           JEANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
           He played for hours and hours. At
           the bottom of the garden, there
           were two big trees. A plane tree
           and a chestnut tree. After mass on
           Sundays, we used to sit there, each
           under our own tree. It was
           wonderful. We sat gazing into each
           other's eyes.
                         
          All WANDER THE GARDEN.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Aren't my trees beautiful? They
           were my jungle.
                         
          They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting
          behind some thatch, doing his business.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          KID 1
           Having a shit.
                         
          The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS.
                         
                          KID 2
           No, we're doing a poo.
                         
          Jeanne SCOLDS THEM.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Shame on you, doing it in my
           jungle!
                         
                          KID 1
           Watch out!
                         
                          KID 2
           Run for it!
                         
          They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew
          CHASING AFTER THEM.
                         
                          OLYMPIA
           Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go
           and shit in your own country!
                         
          The kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS.

           Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't
           stop, whatever you do!
                         
          Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew
          continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g..
                         
                          JEANNE
           Did you get it?
                         
                          TOM
           Everything.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Olympia was great. It'll give a
           good idea of race relations in the
           suburbs of Paris.
                         
                          TOM
           It's a real jungle here. So, tell
           me about your father.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I thought we'd finished.

                          TOM
           But the colonel... the colonel!
          But Jeanne is OFF.
                         
          AND WE CUT TO--

          We are back at Paul's new place. Jeanne WANDERS THE ROOM
          TOPLESS but covering her breasts with a PILLOW.
                         
          She continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father.
                         
                          JEANNE
           The colonel had green eyes and
           shiny boots. I worshipped him. He
           was so handsome in his uniform.

           What a steaming pile of horseshit.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What?
                         
          Pissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE
          BREAST with at Paul.
                         
          We now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled
          up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from
          a WOODEN CUP.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           What? Don't...
                         
                          PAUL
           All uniforms are bullshit.
           Everything outside this place is
           bullshit. Besides, I don't want to
           hear about your stories, about your
           past, and all that.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He died in Algeria in 58...
                         
                          PAUL
           Or 68 or 28 or 98...
                         
                          JEANNE
           58, and don't joke about things
           like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Listen, why don't you stop talking
           about things that don't matter
           here? What the hell's the
           difference?
                         
          DIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK.
                         
          She huffs over to the other SIDE OF THE ROOM, crossing her
          arms, POUTING.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           So what do I have to say? What do I
           have to do!?
                         
          He turns on to his back to evince his CROTCH.
           33.

           Lollipop...
                         
          He PLAYS A TUNE on his harmonica. She sneaks onto the bed IN
          THE SHADOWS.
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Why don't you go back in America?
                         
          He stops PLAYING THE TUNE.
                         
                          PAUL
           I don't know. Bad memories, I
           guess.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Of what?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh... My father was a... a drunk.
           Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter.
           Super-masculine. And he was tough.
           My mother was very... Very poetic.
           And also a drunk. And... one of my
           memories, when I was a kid, was of
           her being arrested nude. We lived
           in this small town. Farming
           community. We lived on a farm.
           And I'd come home after school and
           she'd be gone. In jail... or
           something. And... I used to... I
           used to have to milk a cow every
           morning and every night and I liked
           that. I remember...
                         
          An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           One time I was all dressed up to go
           out and take this girl to a
           basketball game. And I started to
           go out and my father said, "You
           have to milk the cow." I said,
           "Would you please milk it for me?"
           And he said, "No, get your ass out
           there." So I went out and I was in
           a hurry and didn't have time to
           change my shoes. And I had cow shit
           all over my shoes. And on the way
           to the basketball game, it smelled
           in the car. I don't know. I-I can't
           remember very many good things.
           34.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Not one?
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a
           very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,
           and worked real hard. I used to
           work in a ditch, draining land for
           farming. And he wore overalls and
           he smoked a clay pipe. Half the
           time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.
           And I hated the work. It was hot
           and dirty and... it broke my back.
           And... all day long I'd watch his
           spit which would run down the pipe
           stem and hang on the bowl of the
           pipe. And I used to make bets with
           myself on when it was going to fall
           off. And I always lost. I never saw
           it fall off. I'd just look around
           and it'd be gone and then the new
           one would be there. And then we had
           a beautiful... My mother... My
           mother taught me to love nature.
           And... I guess that was the most
           she could do. And... we had... In
           front of our house we had this big
           field... meadow. It was a mustard
           field in the summer and we had a
           big black dog named Dutchy. And she
           used to hunt for rabbits in that
           field but she couldn't see them. So
           she'd have to leap up in this
           mustard field and look around very
           quickly to see where the rabbits
           were. And it was... very beautiful.
           And she never caught the rabbits.
                         
          Jeanne looks up from the bed, MISCHIEVOUSLY.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You have been had!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh really?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't wanna know anything about
           your past, baby!
                         
                          PAUL
           You think I was telling you the
           truth?
           35.
                         
                         
          Jeanne flaps her arms. Paul TWILLS his eyebrows in response.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Maybe... Maybe...
                         
          Jeanne climbs on the bed with the top sheet like a LIONESS
          STALKING her prey.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're
           the wolf.
                         
          She COVERS HIM UP with the sheet. Then she uncovers his arm.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           What strong arms you have!
                         
          She SNIFFS HIS ARM. Paul PLAYS ALONG.
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to squeeze a fart out of
           you!
                         
          She plays with his hands.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What long nails you have!
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to scratch your ass
           with.
                         
          She REACHES UNDER the sleeve of his shirt to his chest.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, what a lot of fur you have!
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to let your crabs hide
           in.
                         
          She lifts the sheet from his face, moves his harmonica and
          looks in his mouth.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Ooh, what a long tongue you have!
                         
          He TALKS FUNNY as Jeanne holds on to his tounge.
                         
                          PAUL
           The better to... to stick in your
           rear, my dear.
           36.
                         
                         
          She makes her way down to his CROTCH, uncovering the sheet as
          she goes. She REGARDS HIS PRIVATE AREA.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What's this for?
                         
                          PAUL
           That's your happiness and my... my
           ha-penis.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Peanuts?
                         
          Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES
          for the MALE GENITALIA.
                         
                          PAUL
           Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte.
           Prick! Joint!
                         
          Jeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's funny. It's like playing grown-
           ups when you're little. I feel like
           a child again here.
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you have fun as a kid?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's the most beautiful thing.
                         
                          PAUL
           It's beautiful to be made into a
           tattletale or forced to admire
           authority or sell yourself for a
           piece of candy.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I wasn't like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           No?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I was writing poems. I was drawing
           castles,... big castles with tower.
           A lot of tower.
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you ever think about sex?
           37.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. No sex.
                         
          Paul MOCKS HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           "No. No sex."
                         
                          JEANNE
           Tower.
                         
          He gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head.
                         
                          PAUL
           You were probably in love with your
           teacher.
                         
                          JEANNE
           My teacher was a woman.
                         
                          PAUL
           And she was a lesbian.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How did you know?
                         
                          PAUL
           That's classical... Anyway...
                         
                          JEANNE
           My first love was my cousin Paul.
                         
          Paul explodes.
                         
                          PAUL
           No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid
           if you keep telling me names. No
           names. I don't mind if you tell
           the truth, but don't give me the
           names.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Sorry. Sorry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, go on. Tell the truth. What
           else?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I was ... He was dark, very thin. I
           can see him. Big nose! A big
           romance. I fell in love with him
           when I heard him playing piano.
           38.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean when he first got into
           your knickers.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He was a child prodigy. He was
           playing with both hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll bet he was... Probably getting
           his kicks.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We were dying of heat.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?
                         
                          JEANNE
           In the afternoon, when the grown-
           ups were napping...
                         
                          PAUL
           You started grabbing his joint.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You're crazy!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, he touched you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I never let him! Never!
                         
                          PAUL
           Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire,
           nose as long as a telephone wire.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, I'm not.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look me straight in the face and
           say, "He didn't touch me once."
           Huh?
                         
          She SMILES.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He touched me, but the way he did
           it.
           39.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Aha! The way he did it. OK, what
           did he do?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Behind the house, there were two
           trees. A plane tree and a chestnut.
           I sat under the plane tree and he
           sat under the chestnut. And one,
           two, three... We each began to
           masturbate. The first who came...
           won!
                         
          Paul is suddenly LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. He wanders to the
          wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you listening to me?
                         
                          PAUL
           When did you first come? How old
           were you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           The first time? I was really late
           for school. I started running and
           it was downhill. All of a sudden,
           I felt a strong sensation here.
           So I ran and ran and I came as I
           ran. The faster I ran, the better
           it was and the more I came. A
           couple of days later, I tried to do
           it again, but no luck.
                         
          Paul climbs a TRIPOD that is leaning against the wall.
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you listening to me?
                         
          He takes the PIN OUT and it comes apart. He FALLS BACK.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Why do I feel like I'm talking to a
           brick wall when I talk to you? Your
           solitude weighs on me. It isn't
           indulgent. It isn't generous. You
           are selfish!
                         
          He finally looks at her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I can be by myself, too, you know!
                         
          DRUM MUSIC STARTS AS...
           40.
                         
                         
          He smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her
          head and goes into the NEXT ROOM.
                         
          She THROWS THE HARMONICA on the floor in disgust.
                         
          As he FIDDLE FARTS around the apartment, Jeanne MASTURBATES.
                         
                         DINING ROOM
                         
          Paul is REUNITED with his SMALL LAMP SHADE. He puts it over
          his face and CRIES into it.
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Jeanne has CUM. She ROLLS OFF THE MATTRESSES onto the floor,
          SPENT.
                         
          She ROCKS BACK AND FORTH on her haunches.
                         
          A SIREN screams outside. She hugs the wall.
                         
                         DINING ROOM
                         
          Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL - LOBBY
                         
          SAX MUSIC PLAYS - from a room in the HOTEL.
                         
          It's soothing and nice. Nevertheless, Rosa's mother roams the
          room, sleepless, a CROCHET BLANKET wrapped around her. Paul
          sleeps on the couch. She covers him with a the blanket,
          MATERNAL.
                         
          He THROWS IT on the floor.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           I can't sleep with this music.
                         
                          PAUL
           I came to this hotel a long time
           ago, to spend one night. And I
           stayed for five years.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           When Papa and I had the hotel,
           people came here to sleep.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, there's all sorts. They can
           hide, take drugs, play music.
           41.
                         
                         
          Rosa's mother reaches out and strokes Paul's arm.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Take your hand away.
                         
          She continues stroking.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.
                         
          He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then... BITES
          HER!!!
                         
          She PULLS HER HAND BACK in obvious pain.
                         
           ROSA'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
           You're crazy! I'm starting to
           understand.
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you want me to make them shut
           up? OK. I'll make them shut up.
                         
          Paul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's
          mother STANDS, SCARED.
                         
                         
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           What are you doing, Paul? I'm
           afraid!
                         
          Paul STALKS TOWARD her in the DARK.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's the matter, Mother? Are you
           upset? Don't be. There's nothing to
           be upset about. It takes so little
           to make them afraid. I'll tell you
           what they're afraid of.
                         
          He leads her by the ARM to the stairs.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           They're afraid of the dark. Imagine
           that! Come on, Mother. Meet my
           friends.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Put the light on!
                         
          They look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of

                          PAUL
           You should meet a few clients of
           the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you
           to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is
           Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr
           Saxophone, he's... He's our
           connection, Mom. He gives us some
           hard stuff once in a while. And
           right here is the beautiful Miss
           Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a
           few points when she takes her teeth
           out.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           The light, Paul.
                         
                          PAUL
           Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh!
           You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's
           afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing.
           All right, sweetheart. I'll take
           care of you. I'll give you a little
           light. I'll give you a little
           light. Don't you worry about a
           thing.
                         
                         
          Paul turns the lights back on. The GUESTS who are gathered on
          the stairs, scurry back to their rooms.

          Rosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST
          comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL,
          (60's) Rosa's LOVER.
          He takes off his hat for her.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Good evening, madame.
                         
                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Good evening.
                         
          Paul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE.
                         
                          PAUL
           Good evening, Marcel.
                         
          Marcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs
          to his room. Paul hands him a key on the way up.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Goodnight, Paul.

                          ROSA'S MOTHER
           Who's that?
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you like him? He was Rosa's
           lover.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. APT. BUILDING - BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          Jeanne, NAKED, roots through Paul's coat pockets. She finds
          his RAZOR, but scoots to the sink when she HEARS HIM COMING.
          She starts applying makeup and SINGING.
                         
          Paul enters the bathroom. He takes his SHAVING ACCOUTREMENTS
          (razor, strop, brush, etc.) out of his coat pockets. Jeanne
          watches him intently in the MIRROR.
                         
          He joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have
          been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What am I doing in this apartment
           with you? Love?
                         
          Paul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving
          brush.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well... Let's say we're just taking
           a flying... a flying fuck at a
           rolling doughnut.
                          JEANNE
           So you think I'm a wore.
                         
          He MOCKS her obvious mispronunciation of "whore".
                         
                          PAUL
           I think you're a what? A what? A
           wore?
                         
                          JEANNE
           A wore.
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean whore.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes, a whore. Whore.
           44.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           No, you're just a good old
           fashioned girl... trying to get
           along.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I prefer to be a whore.
                         
          She applies more makeup.
                         
                          PAUL
           Why were you going through my
           pockets?
                         
                          JEANNE
           To find out OOH you are.
                         
          He MOCKS her mispronunciation of "who" this time.
                         
                          PAUL
           To find out OOH you are.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, if you look real close,
           you'll see me hiding behind my
           zipper.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Well, we know that he buys clothes
           in some big store. That's not much.
           But it's a beginning.
                          PAUL
           That's not a beginning, that's a
           finish.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old
           are you?
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll be 93 this weekend.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, you don't look it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you.
                         
          She LAUGHS.
           45.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           Have you been in college?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the
           University of Congo. Studied whale-
           fucking.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Wow!
                         
          He SHARPENS his razor on the STROP.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Barbers don't usually go to
           university.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you telling me that I look like
           a barber?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, but that's a razor's barber.
                         
          He CORRECTS her again.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's a barber's razor.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Barber's razors, yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Or a madmans.
          He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you want to cut me up?
                         
                          PAUL
           No. That would be like writing my
           name on your face.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Like they do to slaves?
                         
                          PAUL
           Slaves are branded on the ass and I
           want you free.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Free?! I'm not free! You want to
           know why...
                          (MORE)
           46.
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           why you don't want to know anything
           about me? Because you hate women.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really?
                         
                          JEANNE
           What the hell have they ever done
           to you?
                         
                          PAUL
           Well,... either they always pretend
           to know who I am or they pretend I
           don't know who they are and that's
           very boring.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm not afraid to say who I am. I
           am 20 years old...
                         
          Paul EXPLODES.
                         
                          PAUL
           NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is
           your brain? State zitta. Halt's
           Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get
           it?
                         
          She stands, POUTING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I know it's tough but you're gonna
           have to bear it.
                         
          She hits the sink and TURNS to us, we see her AMPLE BUSH. She
          crosses her arms and continues to POUT like a child.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You know, these sinks are really
           beautiful. They're very rare, you
           don't find them any more. I think
           it's these sinks that let you stay
           together.
                         
          He has finished SHAVING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hmm? Don't you think?
                         
          He FINALLY NOTICES her pouting.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's that? What's all this?
           47.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Mad?
                         
          He throws her over his shoulder. He SPINS HER AROUND. She
          screams but goes with it.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Mad? Mad? Mad?
                         
          She LOVES IT. He puts her down on the sink. She is LAUGHING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I think I'm happy with you.
                         
          He leaves the bathroom. She slaps the sink top, CHILDLIKE.
                         
                          JEANNE

          Paul is all dressed. He is ready to leave. We hear Jeanne
          from the BATHROOM.
                         
          DIALOGUE IS FRENCH
                         
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           I'm coming! I'm ready.
                         
          She comes around the corner...
                         
                          JEANNE
           Shall we leave together?
                         
          ... Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Bastard! He's a git! Not even
           goodbye!
                         
          She THROWS HER PURSE at the door.

          A train enters the station. Tom gets off. He searches for
          Jeanne.
           48.
                         
                         
          When the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the
          adjacent track.
                         
          She notices him first.
                         
                          JEANNE

           Jeanne! What are you doing there?
           I'm coming! I'll fly!
                         
          He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Wait! I've got to talk to you.
                         
                          TOM
           Why didn't you speak on the phone?
           What's up?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You must find someone else.
                         
                          TOM
           For what?
                         
                          JEANNE
           For your film.
                         
                          TOM
           Why.
                         
          He FRAMES HER with his fingers.
                          JEANNE
           Because you're taking advantage of
           me! Because you make me do things
           I've never done! Because you're
           taking up my time! You make me do
           whatever you want! The film is
           over!
                         
          A train ROARS into the station between them. Jeanne is
          ANNOYED.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm tired of being raped!
                         
          The train is gone, but there is no one there... Tom is GONE.
                         
          Jeanne walks toward the EXIT. Tom appears on HER SIDE of the
          platform.
           49.
                         
                         
          They STALK EACH other like ANIMALS. He SLAPS HER HARD in the
          head. She SLAPS him back.
                         
          They FIGHT until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL - MARCELS ROOM - EVENING
                         
          Marcel is in his RED PLAID BATHROBE. He sits at his desk,
          clipping coupons from a NEWSPAPER.

                          MARCEL
           Come in!
                         
          Paul comes in. He is in a MATCHING RED PLAID BATHROBE.
                         
                          PAUL
           You wanted to talk to me. Go on,
           then. You know I haven't come to
           cry with you?
                         
                          MARCEL
           Do you mind if I carry on working?
                         
          He does while Paul ROOTS AROUND.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           It helps me a lot after what has
           happened.
          He takes notice of PAUL'S ROBE.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           Identical. Rosa wanted them
           identical.
                         
                          PAUL
           Our bathrobes? You can't tell me
           anything I don't already know.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Same colour, same pattern.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yes, yes, yes.
                         
          Paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from Marcel's
          desk.
           50.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Your meticulous. I've always
           wondered why you save newspaper
           clippings. Is it work? Or a hobby?
                         
                          MARCEL
           Hobby? I don't like that word.
           Let's say it's some extra cash.
           I do it for an agency.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, so it's serious. It's a job
           that makes you read? Very
           educational.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Be honest. You didn't know we had
           the same bathrobes.
                         
          Paul finds this VERY AMUSING.
                         
                          PAUL
           Marcello...
                         
          He sits on MARCELS BED.
                         
                          MARCEL
           We've got a lot of things in
           common.
                         
                          PAUL
           Marcello, I know everything.
                         
          He flicks the light on and off as he talks.
           No, Rosa often talked to me about
           you. I don't think there are many
           marriages like that. It's
           strange... I'm thirsty.
                         
          He heads to the door.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Would you like a shot of bourbon?
                         
          Marcel stops him.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Hold on. Here's the bourbon.
                         
          He takes a BOTTLE OF BOURBON from a hiding place. Paul joins
          him. He pours a glass for Paul.
           51.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Was that a present from Rosa, too?
                         
          He POURS A GLASS for himself.
                         
                          MARCEL
           I don't really like bourbon, but
           Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle
           here in my room.
                         
          He SITS back down.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           I was asking myself this question.
           If, with these little things,
           unimportant things, we could go
           back over things, and understand
           together.
                         
                          PAUL
           Together?
                         
                          MARCEL
           It's almost a year that Rosa and
           I... Not passionately, but
           regularly... I thought I knew her
           as much as you can know...
                         
                          PAUL
           Your mistress...
                         
                          MARCEL
           For example, a while ago, something
           happened that I still don't
           understand. Do you see there, on
           the wall?
                         
          He points to a spot on the wall above them.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           She had climbed onto the bed and
           she was trying to tear at the walls
           with her hands. I stopped her
           because she was breaking her nails.
           She had a strange... violence about
           her. I'd never seen her like that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Our room is painted white. Rosa
           wanted it to be different from the
           other rooms in the hotel.
                         
          Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket.
           52.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           To make it look like... a more
           normal home. But... it had to be
           changed here, too. I think she
           started with the wall.
                         
          Paul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation.
                         
                          MARCEL
           A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.
                         
          Paul regards him for a second.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're lucky huh? You were... You
           must have been very handsome 20
           years ago.
                         
                          MARCEL
           Not as much as you.
                         
                          PAUL
           You've still got all your hair.
                         
                          MARCEL
           My hair... I have to have it
           trimmed often. And wash it. I wash
           it nearly every day.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Don't you have massages?
                         
          He massages his own temples.
                          MARCEL
           Yes, I do.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're in good shape.
                         
          He paws at Marcel's stomach.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What do you do for... your stomach?
           That's my problem.
                         
                          MARCEL
           For that...
                         
          He gazes across the room.
                         
                          MARCEL (CONT'D)
           I have a secret.
           53.
                         
                         
          He gets up and heads across the room.
                         
                          PAUL
           Tell me!
                         
          He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on
          the top of a DOOR FRAME.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Ah...
                         
                          MARCEL
           Are you leaving us? I saw your
           suitcase was packed. Ah... America.
           Why was she unfaithful to you?
                         
                          PAUL
           You can't believe that Rosa...
           killed herself. It's hard for me
           to... believe, too.
                         
          While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his
          PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar.
                         
                          MARCEL
           This is my secret! Thirty times
           every morning.
                         
          Paul leaves, DISGUSTED.
                         
                          PAUL
                          (ENGLISH)
           Really, Marcello, I wonder what she
           ever saw in you.

          Jeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a
          BAG.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Are you in?
                         
          She looks around the place.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Is anyone here?
                         
          She kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the...
                         
                         DINING ROOM
           54.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Hi, monster.
                         
          She throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a
          PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Is something wrong?
                         
                         
          From the other room we hear Paul...
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           There's butter in the kitchen.
                         
          We see that Paul is laying on the floor eating bread.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So you're here? Why didn't you
           answer?
                         
                          PAUL
           Go get the butter.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I have to hurry. I have a cab
           waiting.
                         
                          PAUL
           Go get the butter.
                         
          She STORMS into the kitchen. Paul continues eating.
                         
          She comes out and THROWS THE BUTTER on the floor in front of
          him.
                          JEANNE
           It makes me crazy!
                         
          She sits on the floor and opens a MIRRORED door on a cabinet.
          We see PAUL'S REFECTION IN IT.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           That you're so damned sure that I'm
           coming back here.
                         
          He laughs at her. She sits on her HAUNCHES, then her ass.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Do you really think that an
           American sitting on the floor in an
           empty flat eating cheese and
           drinking water is interesting?
           55.
                         
                         
          He NODS YES. She knocks on the FLOOR near her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           There's something under here. Can
           you hear it? It's hollow. Can you
           hear it? It's hollow.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. That's a hiding place.
                         
          He crawls toward her. We see Jeanne's reflection in a MIRROR
          behind him. He reaches toward the hollow spot. She SLAPS HIS
          HAND.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Don't open it!
                         
                          PAUL
           Why not?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know. Don't open it.
                         
          He points to her CROTCH.
                         
                          PAUL
           What about that? Can I open that?
                         
          He reaches for it but she MOVES AWAY.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Huh? Wait a minute. Maybe there's
           jewels in it.
                         
          He starts to UNDO HER PANTS.
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Maybe there's gold.
                         
          He PULLS THE BUTTER OVER WITH HIS FOOT.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Are you afraid?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No.
                         
                          PAUL
           No?
                         
          He YANKS HER by the legs CLOSER TO HIM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You're always afraid.
           56.
                         
                         
          He FLIPS HER ON HER stomach, violently. She is not in the
          SAME GAME.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, but... maybe there is some
           family secrets inside.
                         
                          PAUL
           Family secrets?
                         
          He RIPS HER PANTS DOWN TO HER ANKLES.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'll tell you about family secrets.
                         
          He gets a HAND FULL OF BUTTER.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm gonna tell you about the
           family.
                         
          He YANKS her pants down enough to put his HAND FULL OF BUTTER
          in her ASS.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           That holy institution meant to
           breed virtue in savages.
                         
          He SPREADS the butter in her ASS as she STRUGGLES.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I want you to repeat it after me.
          He MOUNTS HER, opening his ZIPPER. She STRUGGLES more.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No and no! No!
                         
                          PAUL
           Repeat it. Say, "Holy family."
           Come on, say it.
                         
          He grabs her arms, stopping her from STRUGGLING as he
          SODOMIZES HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Go on. Holy family. Church of good
           citizens.
                         
          She is WEEPING.
           57.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE

                          JEANNE
           Good citizens...
                         
          She CRIES OUT in pain as he enters her.
                         
          He smacks her savagely on the back of her head.
                         
                          PAUL
           Say it. Say it! The children are
           tortured until they tell their
           first lie.
                         
                          JEANNE
           The children... are tortured...
                         
          Her MUFFLED CRIES.
                         
                          PAUL

           repression.
                         
                          JEANNE

           repression.
                         
          TEARS STREAM DOWN her face.
                         
                          PAUL
           Where freedom...

           Free... Freedom!
                         
                          PAUL

          He COLLAPSES on her, SPENT as she continues to WEEP.

          Paul SLEEPS more. On his STOMACH now, with his foot on a
          piece of FURNITURE.
                         
          Jeanne puts a record on the RECORD PLAYER she brought with
          her. She goes to plug it into the FLOOR PLUG but gets an
          ELECTRICAL SHOCK.
                          JEANNE
           Shit!
                         
          She looks at him sleeping.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Hey, you!
                         
          He looks at her UPSIDE DOWN.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Yes, you!
                         
                          PAUL
           Huh?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I've got a surprise for you.
           59.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           What?
                         
          He looks at himself in a SMALL MIRROR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I've got a surprise for you!
                         
                          PAUL
           That's good. I like surprises.
                         
          He FLIPS HIMSELF over backwards onto his feet. He walks over
          to her and the RECORD PLAYER. He stares down at her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What is it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Music. But I don't know how to work
           it.
                         
          He sits on the FLOOR next to her. He plugs in the RECORD
          PLAYER. He JUMPS as he gets an ELECTRICAL SHOCK. Jeanne is
          secretly amused.
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you enjoy that?
                         
          He gets the RECORD PLAYING. It's some 70's HIPPY MUSIC.
          Jeanne sways to it while Paul reads the JACKET COVER.

          Tom and Jeanne sit, ROMANTICALLY ENTWINED on a SEA WALL while
          his FILM CREW films in the b.g.
                         
          They sit FACE TO FACE, he holds her shoulders and stares into
          her eyes.
                         
                          TOM
           Do you know why I sent the others
           away?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Because you're angry, or you want
           to be alone with me?
           60.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           And why do I want to be alone with
           you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You have something really serious
           to tell me.
                         
          He plays with her hair.
                         
                          TOM
           I have something really very
           serious to tell you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Is it happy or sad?
                         
                          TOM
           It's a secret.
                         
                          JEANNE
           So it's happy. What sort of secret?
                         
                          TOM
           A secret...
                         
          As his FILM CREW dolly around them in the b.g., his SOUND
          PERSON yells at them.
                         
                          SOUND PERSON

          We're getting married?

           Of course, I'll send everything to

           Olympia will be happy. I went there

          Her mother joins her inside. She carries the FATHERS BOOTS.

           Of course, I'm not sending the
           boots. I'm keeping them with me. I
           get strange shivers when I touch
           them.
                         
                         
          Jeanne goes into an ADJOINING ROOM while her mom continues

          She looks up just in time to see that Jeanne has found her
          fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction.
                         
                          JEANNE
           When I was little, it seemed really
           heavy when Papa taught me how to
           shoot.
                         
                          JEANNE'S MOTHER
           I'm keeping that here. In a
           respectable household, it's useful
           to have a weapon.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You don't even know how to use it.
                         
                          JEANNE'S MOTHER
           The important thing is to have one.
           It makes an impression.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You really kept everything of

          She shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her

           Don't worry. You'll soon have all

           On walls. On buildings.

                          JEANNE
           No. They're all about young
           couples. Before marriage, no
           children. Then the same couple,
           married with children. In short,
           marriage. The perfect, ideal,
           successful marriage. It's no longer
           the preserve of the Church. The
           husband was burdened with
           responsibilities and the wife
           nagged. Now, weddings in
           advertising smile!

                          JEANNE
           On posters, of course. But why t
           take poster marriage seriously?
           Marriage... Pop marriage!

           Pop? That's the formula. For pop
           youth, pop marriage! But... what if
           the pop marriage doesn't work?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Then you have to fix it like you
           would a car. The spouses are two
           workers in overalls bending over an
           engine to fix it.
                         
                          TOM
           And in case of adultery what
           happens to the pop marriage?

           In that case, there are three or
           four workers.
                         
                          TOM
           What about love? Is love pop?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
                         
                          TOM
           Love isn't pop. So what is it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           The workers retire to a secret
           flat, take off their overalls
           and become men and women again
           and make love.
                         
          The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON
          HER GLOVES, relishing them.
                         
          She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her
          dress.
                         
          Tom is CAPTIVATED.
                         
                          TOM
           You're wonderful.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's the dress that makes the
           bride.
                         
                          TOM
           You're better than Rita Hayworth.
                         
          He wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY.
                         
           Better than Joan Crawford! Better
           than Kim Novak! Better than Lauren

           What are you doing? Stop! Stop, but
           keep filming! Why aren't you
           filming in the rain?

          They huddle underneath the DOOR of the FILM TRUCK.
                         
          Tom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with
          his CREW.
                         
                          TOM
           You're all fired!
                         
          He goes back to the SHOP.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Where's Jeanne?

           She must have run off.
                         
                          TOM
           When? ln the rain?
                         
          He runs down the street in the rain looking for her.

          Paul comes POINDING in from the rain. He STOMPS the water off
          his shoes. He breaks into an IMPROMPTU SOFT SHOE.
                         
          He opens the gate to the ELEVATOR and gets on. He pushes the
          button. The elevator STARTS UP.
                          JEANNE'S VOICE
           Please forgive me!
                         
          Paul stops the elevator. He SENDS IT BACK DOWN.
                         
          We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for
          Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS.
                         
          She implores Paul from outside the elevator.

                          (FRENCH)
           Forgive me! I wanted to leave you
           and I couldn't.
                          (ENGLISH)
           I wanted to leave you and I

          She stands, PLEADING at the ELEVATOR.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Do you still want me?
                         
          Paul does the EYEBROW TRILL. He opens the elevator so she can
          get on.

          The door flies open. Paul comes in CARRYING Jeanne in his
          arms.
                         
                          PAUL
           Voilà!
                         
          He starts doing a JIG AND SONG... all the way to the
          MATTRESSES.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh, there once was a man
           And he had an old sow ow! Hi-diddle-
           dow...
                         
          He puts her on the bed. She is GIGGLING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You're wet.
                         
          Paul pats her stomach and leaves the room.

          Paul opens the curtains.
                         
          Jeanne's SCREAMS come from the other room. He goes to
          investigate.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What the hell?
                         
          BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne screams BLOODY MURDER and points to a DEAD RAT on the
          STILL UNMADE MATTRESS.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           A rat. Only a rat.
                         
          He PICKS IT UP by the tail. She stumbles over herself to get
          away.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           There are more rats in Paris than
           people. Yum, yum, yum.
                         
          He holds it out, OFFERING IT to her. She freaks. She runs to
          the other side of the room.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I want to go!
                         
          He brings it to her... she continues to BACK PEDDLE.
                         
                          PAUL
           Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite
           first? You don't want to run and
           eat.
                         
                          JEANNE
           This is the end!
                         
          He points to the ASS of the RAT.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, this is the end...
                         
          Then points to the HEAD.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...but I like to start with the
           head. That's the best part. Are you
           sure you won't have any? OK.
                         
          He DANGLES IT over his mouth, flitting his tounge, pretending
          to eat it. She is gonna HURL.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's the matter? You don't dig
           rat?
                         
                          JEANNE
           I wanna go! I can't make love in
           this bed any more. I can't. It's
           disgusting! Nauseating!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or
           standing on the mantel.
           71.
                         
                         
          He holds up the RAT again.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Listen, I gotta get some mayonnaise
           for this. Because, it really is
           good with mayonnaise.
                         
          He heads out, then stops and LOOKS BACK AT HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'll save the asshole for you.
                         
          He really leaves this time.
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!
                         
          He LAUGHS at himself.
                         
          Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I want to get out of here. I want
           to go. I can't stand it here any
           more. Yes. I'm going.
                         
          She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her
          ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           I'm not coming back... ever.
                         
          She gets to the...
                         
                         FRONT DOOR
          Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT.

                          JEANNE
           I forgot to tell you something. I
           fell in love with somebody.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know,
           you're going to have to get out of
           these wet duds.
                         
          He PATS HER ASS.

          She opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the
          HALL.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, first you have to take a hot
           bath. Cos if you don't...
                         
          He walks toward her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           ...you're gonna get pneumonia,
           right? Huh?
                         
          She STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           And then you know what happens? You
           get pneumonia, then you know what
           happens? You die. And then, you
           know what happens when you die?
           I get to fuck the dead rat!
                         
          He THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND
          SCREAMING into the...

                          PAUL
           Give me the soap.
          She does.

           You're in love?
                         
          He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER.

           How delightful.
                         
          She comes up ANGRY.

          He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head.

           Oh! I'm in love!
                         
          He HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more
          ANGRY.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           You know, you're old! You're
           getting fat.
                         
                          PAUL
           Fat, is it? How unkind.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Half of your hair is out and the
           other half is almost white.
                         
          He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles.
                         
                          PAUL
           In ten years, you'll be playing
           soccer with your tits.
                         
          He starts WASHING HER back.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What do you think of that? You know
           what I'm gonna be doing?
                          JEANNE
           You will be on a... wheelchair!
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll
           be smirking and giggling all the
           way to eternity.
                         
                          JEANNE
           How poetic. But please, before you
           go, wash my feet.
                         
          She holds up A FOOT.
                         
                          PAUL
           OK. oblesse oblige.
           74.
                         
                         
          He sits on the edge of the TUB and grabs her foot. He takes a
          sniff... She pulls it away.
                         
                          JEANNE
           You know, he and I, we make love.
                         
          He WASHES her foot.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he
           a good fucker?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Magnificent.
                         
          He puts up the OTHER FOOT to was, he obliges again.
                         
                          PAUL
           You know, you're a jerk. Cos the
           best fucking you're gonna get
           is right here in this apartment.
           Stand up.
                         
          She does. He washes her ASS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           He is full of mysteries.
                         
                          PAUL
           Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb
           dodo. All the mysteries that you're
           ever gonna know in life are right
           here.
                         
          He washes her STOMACH.
                          JEANNE
           He is like everybody but... at the
           same time he's different.
                         
                          PAUL
           You mean, like everybody.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah, but... even he fright me.
           Even he frightens me.
                         
                          PAUL
           What is he, your local pimp?
                         
                          JEANNE
           He could be. He looks it. You know
           why I'm in love with him?
           75.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           I can't wait.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Because he know. He know how to
           make me fall in love with him.
                         
          She gets out. He COVERS her with a BIG RED TOWEL.
                         
                          PAUL
           You want this man you love to
           protect and take care of you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           You want this golden, shining,
           powerful warrior to build a
           fortress where you can hide in. So
           you don't have to ever... have...
           You don't ever have to be afraid.
           You don't have to feel lonely or
           empty. That's what you want, isn't
           it?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, you'll never find it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I find this man.
                          PAUL
           Then it won't be long until he'll
           want you to build a fortress for
           him out of your tits and out of
           your cunt and your hair and your
           smile and the way you smell. And...
           and some place where he can feel
           comfortable and secure enough so
           that he can worship in front of the
           altar of his own prick.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I find this man!
                         
          They lean against SEPERATE WALLS.
           76.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           No, you're alone. You're all alone.
           You won't be free of that feeling
           of being alone until you look death
           right in the face. I mean, that
           sounds like bullshit, some romantic
           crap, until you go right up into
           the ass of death. Right up in his
           ass... till you find the womb of
           fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe
           then, you'll be able to find him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I find this man. He's you! You
           are that man!
                         
          Paul doesn't like that comment. He needs to TEACH HER another
          LESSON. He bites a HANGNAIL.
                         
                          PAUL
           Get me the scissors.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           Get me the fingernail scissors.
                         
          She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           No. I want you to cut the
           fingernails on your right hand,
           these two.
          She DOES.
                         
                          JEANNE
           That's it.
                         
          He stands FACING the wall and PULLS HIS pants down.
                         
                          PAUL
           I want you to put your fingers up
           my ass.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           Put your fingers up my ass, are you
           deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig...
           and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig
           fuck you.

           77.
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I want the pig to vomit in your
           face and I want you to swallow the
           vomit. Are you gonna do that for
           me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           Huh?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yeah!
                         
                          PAUL
           I want the pig to die while...
           while you're fucking him. Then
           you'll have to go behind him. I
           want you to smell the dying farts
           of the pig. Are you gonna do all of
           that for me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes, and more than that! And worse!
           And worse than before.

          INT. HOTEL - TEMPORARY VIEWING ROOM - DAY
                         
          ROSA'S WAKE. Rosa's mother has set up a room in the Hotel as
          a VIEWING ROOM for her daughter. She is, as promised,
          surrounded by TONS OF FLOWERS.
          Paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to ROSA. He turns on
          the LIGHT.
                         
                          PAUL
           You look ridiculous in that make-
           up. Like the caricature of a whore.
           A little touch of Mommy in the
           night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the
           bathtub. I wish you could see
           yourself. You'd really laugh.
           You're your mother's masterpiece.
                         
          He pulls the chair closer to her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh Christ! There are too many
           fucking flowers in this place. I
           can't breathe. You know on the top
           of the closet?

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
          The cardboard box, I found all
          your... I found all your little
          goodies.
          Pens, keychains, foreign money,
          French ticklers, the whole shot.
          Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't
          know you collected all those little
          knick-knacks left behind. Even if
          the husband lives fucking years,
          he's never going to be able to
          discover his wife's real nature.
          I mean, I... I might be able to
          comprehend the universe, but... 'll
          never discover the truth bout you.
          Never. I mean, who the hell were
          you? Remember that day, the first
          day I was there? I knew that I
          couldn't get into your pants unless
          I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah.
          "May I have my bill, please? I have
          to leave." Remember? Last night...
          I ripped off the lights on your
          mother. And the whole joint went
          bananas. All your... guests... as
          you used to call them... Well, I
          guess that includes me, doesn't it?
          It does include me, doesn't it? For
          five years, I was more a guest in
          this fucking flophouse than a
          husband. With privileges, of
          course. And then, to help me
          understand you, you let me inherit
          Marcel. The husband's double, whose
          room was the double of ours. And
          you know what? I didn't even have
          the guts to ask him. Didn't have
          the guts to ask him if the same
          numbers you and I did were the same
          numbers you did with him. Our
          marriage was nothing more than a
          foxhole for you. And all it took
          for you to get out was a -cent
          razor and a tub full of water. You
          cheap, goddamn, fucking,
          godforsaken whore. I hope you rot
          in hell. You're worse than the
          dirtiest street pig anybody could
          find, and you know why? You know
          why? Because you lied. You lied to
          me and I trusted you. You lied. You
          knew you were lying! Go on, tell me
          you didn't lie. Haven't you got
          anything to say about that? You can
          think up something, can't you?

           you cunt!
                         
          He STARTS to WEEP.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Go on, tell me... Tell me something
           sweet. Smile at me and say I just
           misunderstood. Go on, tell me. You
           pig-fucker! You goddamn, fucking,
           pig-fucking liar. Rosa, I'm
           sorry... I just can't... I can't
           stand it... to see these goddamn
           things on your face. You never wore
           make-up. This fucking shit. I'm
           gonna take this off your mouth.
           This lipstick... Rosa... Oh, God!
                         
          He COLLAPSES on her, SOBBING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. I don't know why you did
           it. I'd do it too, if I knew how. I
           just don't know how. I have to... I
           have to find a way.
                         
          [OC] We hear a voice.

           All right, I'm... I'm coming.
           (back to ROSA)
           I have to go. I have to go,
           sweetheart, baby. Somebody's
           calling me.
                         
          He starts to the door.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE'S VOICE
           Well? Is anyone there?
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. I'm coming.

          Outside the FRONT DOOR, the source of the voice, a WORN OUT
          and OLD PROSTITUTE. She is with her JOHN.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
                          (TO JOHN)
           Here he is.
                          (TO PAUL)
           Hurry up! Wake up! Open up! Open
           up!
                         
                          PAUL
           It's four in the morning.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
           I need room four for a while.
                          (TO JOHN)
           Half an hour?
                          (TO PAUL)
           Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour.
                         
                          PAUL
           We're full.
                         
          She knocks on the door, INCESANTLY.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
           That's not true. When you're full,
           you put a sign outside. I know the
           hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on
           the street. Call the owner. What
           are you waiting for? The owner has
           never made a fuss. Rosa and I are
           old friends. Open up.
          Paul opens up.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)
           Don't make any trouble or I'll tell
           your boss.
                          (TO JOHN)
           Come in, it's all sorted...
                         
          But the man has LEFT.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)
           You've won. He's taken off.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm very sorry.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
           Hurry up! He can't be far away.
           81.
                         
                         
          She PUSHES him out to the street.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE (CONT'D)
           Make him come back. Tell him he
           can't just walk off.
                         
          She SHOVES HIM out the door and DOWN THE STREET.
                         
          Paul CHASES the man on foot for BLOCKS and BLOCKS.
                         
          He finally CATCHES UP to him in a ---

          The JOHN figures he has gotten away. He reverses his TRENCH
          COAT to the appropriate side.
                         
          Paul comes around the corner. The John doesn't see any
          HOSTILITY coming. But it DOES.
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh,... please don't tell her you
           found me. I don't fancy it any
           more. Did you see her face? Once,
           my wife satisfied me. But now she's
           got a skin disease. It's like
           snakeskin. Put yourself in my
           place.
                         
          Paul grabs him by the tie and drags him.
                         
                          PAUL
           Come. Come with me.
                         
          The man FIGHTS BACK.
                         
                          JOHN
           But... Let go of me!
                         
          Paul doesn't like that. He ROUGHS HIM UP, throwing him from
          WALL TO WALL.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           You're crazy! Let go of me! Let go!
                         
          He ends up on the ground MINUS HIS COAT. Paul KICKS HIM IN
          THE ASS like a dog.
                         
                          PAUL
           Get the fuck out of here!

          The man RUNS OFF.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Faggot!
                         
          Paul heads back up the ALLEY as the man CONTINUES OFF in the

          Paul lays down on his TWIN BED with his ROBE on over his
          clothes.
                         
          We see that his BAGS ARE PACKED.

          We see that the mattress is gone. Only a pile of sheets and
          pillows remain in the room.
                         
          Jeanne is on the floor, on her knees, doubled over in SICK
          GRIEF. PAUL HAS MOVED OUT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           No!
                         
          She WANDERS through the apt., GRIEF STRICKEN, from room to
          room. We see only a FEW BELONGINGS left around. Shoes, the
          CAT (where was it for the "rat problem"?) and phone.

          Jeanne RIPS THE SHEET OFF the piece of furniture that has
          been COVERED UP all along. We all wondered what was
          underneath that was so precious.
                         
          It's nothing special. She COLLAPSES in grief again, the
          furniture falling on her, she KICKS IT OFF.

           They come and go. The man on the
           fourth, the woman on the first.
           What do I know?
                         
          She gives a CRAZY CACKLE.

           Where did they take the furniture
           too? It's empty. Where do you send
           his mail? Give me his address.

           I've found a flat for us. 1 rue
           Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come
           quickly! You'll come now? Do you
           know where it is? I'll wait for

          Tom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in
          sunlight.
                         
          Tom LOOKS AROUND in b.g.

           Do you like our flat? It's very
           light. There's a tiny room, too.
           It's too small for a double bed. It
           would be fine for a child. Fidel.
           That's a nice name for a boy.
           Fidel, as in Castro.

           But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As
           in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but
           I like it. You know, I wanted to
           film you every day. In the morning,
           when you wake up, in the evening,
           when you sleep. When you first
           smile, and I didn't film any of
           that. Here.

           Today is the last day of shooting.
           The film is finished. I don't like
           things that finish, things that
           end. You have to start something
           else right away.

           86.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           The patches of turbulence are over.
           We can't play like children any
           more, Jeanne.
                         
          This stops Jeanne in her TRACKS.
                         
          They face each other.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           We're adults.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Adults? That's awful!
                         
                          TOM
           Yes. It's awful.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What do adults do?
                         
                          TOM
           I don't know. We'll have to invent
           the gestures and the words. For
           example, adults...
                         
          He walks slowly toward her. They EMBRACE PASSIONATELY. They
          kiss.
                         
          He breaks away again, SERIOUS.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           But there's one thing I do know.
           Adults are calm...
          He walks backward as Jeanne STALKS HIM.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           ...serious, logical, measured,
           level-headed...
                         
                          JEANNE
           Yes...
                         
                          TOM
           And... they face up to problems...
                         
                          JEANNE
           ...Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
                         
          He STOPS ABRUPTLY.
           87.
                         
                         
                          TOM
           You see, Jeanne, this flat won't
           work for us. This flat, it won't
           work for us, Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Where are you going?
                         
                          TOM
           To look for a flat.
                         
          He walks out to a SHOCKED Jeanne.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What kind of flat?
                         
          But he COMES BACK.
                         
                          TOM
           A flat we can live in.
                         
                          JEANNE
           We can live here.
                         
                          TOM
           It's squalid. It smells. It makes
           me sick. Are you coming with me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           No, no. I've got to close the
           windows and return the key. There's
           a lot to do.
                         
                          TOM
           OK.
          They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a
          LOVING HANDSHAKE.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Bye.
                         
                          TOM
           Bye.
                         
          Tom leaves Jeanne to it.
                         
          She opens the LARGE WINDOW. We can hear the TRAIN below. She
          says goodbye to the apt. emotionally, CLOSING THE SHUTTER,
          then finally, the window.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           88.
                         
                         
          EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
                         
          We watch Jeanne come out of the APARTMENT BUILDING. She
          climbs the stairs to the RAISED WALKWAY. She is back where it
          all started. We watch her a bit.
                         
          RAISED WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Jeanne walks, in her own world. A somewhat MORE CONTENT world
          now. Back to HERSELF.
                         
          We suddenly see Paul. He watches her for a moment before
          TRAILING HER. He is more DRESSED UP then we have seen him
          previously.
                         
          As she walks, he RUNS UP BEHIND her and playfully taps her on
          her SHOULDER.
                         
          She turns, SURPRISED.
                         
          DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH
                         
                          PAUL
           It's me again.
                         
          She stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over
          him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over. It's over.
                         
          He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He
          presses on PLAYFULLY.
                         
                          PAUL
           It's over, then it begins again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           What begins again? I don't
           understand anything any more.
                         
                          PAUL
           There's nothing to understand. We
           left the apartment. Now we begin
           again with love and all the rest of
           it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           The rest?
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, listen.
                         
          He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL.
           89.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'm 45. I'm a widower. I've got a
           little hotel, a kind of a dump. But
           it's not completely a flophouse.
           And... I used to live on my luck,
           and I got married. My wife killed
           herself.
                         
          AND WE...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY
                         
          As Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He
          wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR,
          invading their space and lighting a cigarette.
                         
                          PAUL'S VOICE
           But you know, what the hell. I'm...
           no prize. I picked up a nail when I
           was in Cuba in and now I got a
           prostate like an Idaho potato. But
           I'm still a good stick man, even if
           I can't have any children. Let's
           see. I don't have any stomping
           grounds. I don't have any friends.
           I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd
           probably settle for a hard chair
           and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a
           long, dull story even duller, I
           come from a time when a guy like me
           would drop into a joint like this
           and pick up a young chick like you
           and... and call her a bimbo.
                         
          He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne
          waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS.
                         
          He has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED
          PREVIOUSLY.
                         
          She sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE
          FLOOR.
                         
          He approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm awfully sorry to intrude
           but I was so struck with your
           beauty that I thought I could offer
           you a glass of champagne. Is this
           seat taken?
           90.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           No.
                         
                          PAUL
           May I?
                         
                          JEANNE
           If you'd like to.
                         
          He sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           Garcon!
                         
          A WAITER comes over.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You know, the tango is a, is a
           rite. Do you understand "rite"? And
           you must watch the legs of the
           dancers.
                         
          The waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus
          on their LEGS and FEET.
                         
          We make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Oh, no! You haven't drunk your
           champagne because it was warm. And
           then I ordered you a Scotch and you
           haven't drunk your Scotch.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE.
                         
          Paul tries to BUTTER UP (pardon the pun) Jeanne.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Come on. Just a sip for Daddy.
                         
          She takes a sip from the glass he offers her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Now, if you love me, you'll drink
           all of it.
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK, I love you.
           91.
                         
                         
          She SLAMS IT BACK.
                         
                          PAUL
           Bravo!
                         
                          JEANNE
           Tell me about your wife.
                         
                          PAUL
           Let's talk about us.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           OK. But this place is so pitiful.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?
                         
          He kisses her on the cheek.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Monsieur Maitre d'Hôtel.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's rather nasty. Anyway, you
           dummy, I love you. And I want to
           live with you.
                         
                          JEANNE
           In your flophouse?
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           In my flophouse. What the hell does
           that mean? What the hell difference
           does it make if I have a flophouse
           or a hotel or a castle? I love you.
           What the fuck difference does it
           make?!
                         
          She PEEKS OUT A SMILE. He may just be WINNING HER BACK OVER.
                         
                         DANCE FLOOR
                         
          We watch a COUPLE as the MUSIC STOPS. All the PATRONS CLAP as
          the DANCE floor clears.
                         
          The PRESIDENT OF THE TANGO CONTEST speaks at a microphone.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           The jury has chosen the following
           ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9
           ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!
                          (MORE)
           92.
                          PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
           And now, ladies and gentlemen, good
           luck for the last tango!
                         
          More CLAPPING PATRONS.
                         
          We get back to Paul and Jeanne. She sits 2 tables over,
          POUTING, while he struggles to light his CIG. She holds up
          her glass to him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Give me some more whisky.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.
                         
                          JEANNE
           But I'm thirsty now and I want some
           more drink.
                         
                          PAUL
           All right. I think that's a good
           idea.
                         
          He starts to bring the bottle to her then stops, gets his
          drink and brings it too.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute. Because you're
           really beautiful. Wait a minute.
           I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. I
           didn't mean to spill my drink.
                         
          He POURS HER SOME. She holds her glass up.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Let's have a toast to our life in
           the hotel.
                         
                          PAUL
           No! Fuck all that! Come on. No.
           Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to
           our life in the country. Huh?
                         
                          JEANNE
           You're a nature lover? You didn't
           tell me that.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy.
           Can't you see me with the cows and
           the chicken shit all over me?
                         
                          JEANNE
           Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows.
           93.
                         
                         
          She holds her glass up again.
                         
                          PAUL
           Cows.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I will be your cow, too.
                         
                          PAUL
           And listen... I get to milk you
           twice a day. How about that?
                         
          She lays her head on the table.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I hate the country.
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you mean you hate the
           country?
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           I hate it! I prefer to go to the
           hotel. Come on, let's go...
                         
                          PAUL
           No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you
           wanna dance? We can start again.
                         
          He crouches down. She CLIMBS ON HIS BACK for a ride. He pulls
          her on her back onto the DANCE FLOOR, through the TANGO
          contest.
                         
          The JURY IS in an UPROAR.
          The tango President FREAKS OUT.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           That's the limit! What are you
           doing?
                         
          They LIE ON THE FLOOR... They get back up and FEIGN some
          TANGO.
                         
          The President comes out on the floor now to them. She GRABS
          Paul who had DIPPED Jeanne over the JURY TABLE.
                         
                          PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
           You'll have to leave, sir.
                         
          She starts scurrying them off the dance floor.
           94.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           Madame! 'Tis ever love.
                         
          She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. And she can hold her own
          against Paul's SMART ASS MOUTH.
                         
                          PRESIDENT
           Go to the circus if you want to see
           love! Go on! Get out of here!
           You'll have to leave.
                         
          Paul now GRABS HER and starts spinning and DANCING WITH HER.
                         
          He SWEEPS HER UP into his arms.
                         
          She struggles and Paul puts her down. She continues to SHEW
          THEM AWAY. PAUL CONTINUES TO MOCK HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh my god, I've never...
                         
          He pulls his pants down and MOONS HER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Kiss me, sweetheart!
                         
                         
           She is APPALLED and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the
          door, Jeanne FOLLOWING.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Farewell, you sweet peach blossom.
                         
          As they get to the door he spins one last time.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I could dance for ever. Oh, my
           hemorrhoid!
                         
                         
          He LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips. Jeanne has to catch him.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Beauty of mine, sit before me. Let
           me peruse you and remember you
           always like this.
                         
          They sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. Jeanne
          puts her head down on the table in EXHAUSTION.
                         
          He CLAPS LOUDLY till she wakes up. He puts on his ENGLISH
          ACCENT AGAIN.
           95.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Garcon! Champagne! If music be the
           food of love, play on.
                         
          Jeanne looks OVER IT ALL.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           What's the matter with you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished.
                         
          She COLLAPSES on the table again. He kisses her head.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's the matter with you?
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished!
                         
          He's OBLIVIOUS to her seriousness, AGAIN.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's finished?
                         
                          JEANNE
           We're never going to see each other
           again. Never!
                         
                          PAUL
           That's ridiculous.
                         
          She shakes her head NO.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           That's ridiculous!
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's not a joke.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, you dirty rat!
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look, when something's finished, it
           begins again.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'm getting married! I'm going
           away. It's finished.
           96.
                         
                         
          She starts undoing his pants. She starts to PLEASURE HIM.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a
           subway strap, that's me cock!
                         
          She continues...
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's finished!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh... Jesus...
                         
          She MASTURBATES him to CLIMAX. She gets up, wiping her hands,
          then forehead and LEAVES.
                         
          When he RECOVERS and sees her leaving...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute...
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           You dumb bimbo...
                         
          She doesn't stop.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Shit! Wait a minute. Goddamn it!
           Hey!
                         
          She LEAVES THE SALON. He FOLLOWS her out.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Hey, rube! Come here! Come here!
          He SLIDES DOWN THE BANISTER.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Come heeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrreeeeee!
                         
          She turns to see him coming. She starts RUNNING NOW.
                         
          He still THINKS SHE'S JOKING...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna get you! Bimbo!
                         
          He SLIDES ACCROSS THE FLOOR.
                         
          She continues RUNNING. She is FREAKED OUT NOW.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           97.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY
                         
          She is RUNNING on the sidewalk past crowds of people, the
          OFFICE OF TOURISM and stores. He is in HOT PURSUIT.
                         
          She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him.
          He still finds this to be VERY HUMOROUS. She grows more and
          more SERIOUS and SCARED.
                         
          She starts RUNNING again. But she TIRES OUT in a ...
                         
                         PARKING LOT
                         
          She tries to GET THROUGH TO HIM.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Stop! Stop!
                         
                          PAUL
           Hold it!
                         
          He still DOESN'T GET IT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over!
                         
          He tries to EMBRACE HER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hey, cool it!
                         
          She THROWS HIM OFF.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Stop it! We're finished.
          He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Go away! Go away! Go away!
                         
          He keeps trying to grab her purse.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Let go! Go away!
                         
          He FEIGNS GIVING UP as she walks on.
                         
                          PAUL
           I can't win. Give me a break!
                         
          She JETS OFF AGAIN and we round a corner...
                         
                         SIDE STREET
           98.
                         
                         
          He keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but
          still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain
          it to him.
                         
                          JEANNE
           I'll call the police!
                         
          He BLOWS IT OFF.
                         
                          PAUL
           Aha! I smell the henhouse.
                         
          She needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Well, shit, I'm not in your way.
                         
          He feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           After you, mademoiselle!
                         
          She TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           So long, sister. Besides, you're a
           crummy-looking broad. I don't give
           a damn if I never see you again.
           Shit.
                         
          She MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          He TAKES OFF after her.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - LOBBY
                         
          He gets himself BUZZED IN somehow.
                         
          She is SHOCKED, she backs up to the ELEVATOR.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over! It's over!
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, fuck the police.
                         
          She is becoming HYSTERICAL now.
                         
                          JEANNE
           It's over!
           99.
                         
                         
          She makes her way to the
                         
                          PAUL
           Listen, I want to talk to you for
           Christ sake...
                         
          She gets on the OLD FASHIONED LIFT and SLAMS the door in his
          face.
                         
          She begins to ASCEND.
                         
          He FOLLOWS every floor UP THE STAIRS.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Help!
                         
          She is calling to anyone that can hear as he STALKS HER.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Help! Help!
                         
          One FLOOR AFTER ANOTHER...
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Please, help!
                         
          He trips and STUMBLES up the STAIRS after her.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Help! Help!
                         
          Finally at the top, he has to REST against the wall.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, man!
          She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment.
                         
          But HE FOLLOWS. He grabs her as she tries to UNLOCK THE DOOR.
                         
          She runs across to the NEIGHBORS DOOR and BANGS ON IT.
                         
                          JEANNE
           Help! Help me! Help!
                         
          He tries to REASON with her.
                         
                          PAUL
           This is getting ridiculous.
                         
          She sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over
          and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door
          shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN.
           100.
                         
                         
          She HUSTLES to the DRAWER with her FATHERS GUN... Paul is
          still at the FRONT DOOR.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           It's the title shot, baby. We're
           going all the way. Oh, Christ.
                         
          He shuts the door and WANDERS IN...
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Jeanne stands with her back turned staring down into the GUN
          DRAWER.
                         
          He LOOKS AROUND THE PLACE, assessing it...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           It's a little old, but full of
           memories, huh?
                         
          She stares down still, HITTING HER HEAD on the cabinets to
          help her make a decision...
                         
          Paul finds her FATHERS MILITARY HAT. He puts it on.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Mademoiselle...
                         
          He SALUTES HER and CLICKS HIS HEELS together, playing a role.
                         
          She is incensed that he has dared touch her FATHERS PRECIOUS
          BELONGINGS.
                         
          He PLAYS ON.
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           How do you like your hero? Over
           easy or sunny-side up?
                         
          He REMOVES THE HAT and puts it down.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           You ran through Africa and Asia and
           Indonesia.
                         
          He walks LOVINGLY toward her.
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           And now I've found you. And I love
           you.
                         
          He ROMANCES HER, runs his fingers through her hair...
           101.
                         
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           I wanna know your name.
                         
          She STARES into his eyes... as she TELLS HIM HER NAME...
                         
                          JEANNE
           Jeanne...
                         
          ...THE GUN FIRES...
                         
          HE IS SHOCKED BY THE FORCE OF THE BULLET INTO HIS GUT.
                         
          The color DRAINS FROM HIS FACE, his eyes get WOOZY...
                         
          He can only MUTTER.
                         
                          PAUL
           Our children.
                         
                         
          He STAGGERS away from her...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Our children.
                         
          He STAGGERS toward the PORCH DOOR as Jeanne watches...
                         
                          PAUL (CONT'D)
           Our children... will remember.
                         
          He opens the FRENCH DOORS and STAGGERS onto the PORCH.
                         
          PORCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He LOOKS OUT upon the city, and UP TO THE SKY. He takes his
          gum out of his mouth and STICKS IT UNDER THE RAILING.
                         
          His eyes register his BEWILDERMENT as he STARES out into the
          ROOF TOPS.
                         
          We see that he is DEAD -- curled in a FETAL POSITION.
                         
          SAD MUSIC RISES
                         
          LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Jeanne stands in SHOCK with PAUL'S CORPSE in the b.g.
                         
          She mutters to herself the ALIBI FOR THE POLICE.
                         
          DIALOGUE IS FRENCH
           102.
                         
                         
                          JEANNE
           I don't know who he is. He followed
           me in the street. He tried to rape
           me. He's a lunatic. I don't know
           what he's called. I don't know his
           name. I don't know who he is. He
           tried to rape me. I don't know. I
           don't know him. I don't know who he
           is. He's a lunatic. I don't know

      Based on the novel by John O'Brian
	
		
	
	
	
	
	
						SHOOTING SCRIPT
						September 1994
	
	
	
	
	TITLE ON BLACK; '10 P.M. - LOS ANGELES'
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	1 INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
	
		
	It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go 
	to pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents 
	and executives of all ages.
	
	Into this bar comes Ben.
	
	Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit 
	that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't 
	shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has 
	any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man 
	but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still 
	in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the 
	following scene that he is much the worse for wear with 
	drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he
	recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples
	are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde 
	and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. 
	The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs
	looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays 
	his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben 
	is not looking at him.
	 
				BEN
		Peter
		
				PETER
		Ben... how are you, man?
	
	They shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and 
	Peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him 
	to the table.
	
	Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.
	
	
				MARC
		Nice to meet you. I think I 	
		spoke to you on the phone a 	
		couple of years ago. Weren't 	
		you both at MGM with Laddie?
	
				BEN
		That's right. Are you still
		at ICM?
	
				MARC
		No, I'm at Tri-Star now.
	
				BEN
		That's great. Say hello to 	
		Mike for me. That's a 	
		beautiful dress, Debbie, and 	
		those are fabulous earrings, 	
		Sheila.
	
	There is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and 
	is not invited to join them. The girls smile.
	 
				MARC
		I gotta tell you, I'm a big 	
		fan of your writing. I loved 	
		Bay of Pigs.
	
				BEN
		Thanks a lot. I didn't 	
		actually write it, I just got 
		the credit. I was fired.
			(to Peter)
		Can I talk to you for a 	
		moment?
	
	Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. 
	Peter speaks very quietly.
	
				PETER
		Listen, Ben, I can't help you 
		any more. Do you understand?
	
				BEN
			This is the last time. 	
		Promise. I just need some 	
		cash tonight. I lost my 	
		credit cards. The money'll be 
		on your desk first thing 	
		tomorrow morning, Scout's 	
		honor. How's the new one 	
		coming along? I here you got 	
		Richard Gere.
	
	The two men look at each other for a while. Peter's 
	friends are looking at them, as are other people in 
	the room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some 
	notes.
	
				PETER
		This is all I have in cash. 	
		Please don't drink it here.
	
				BEN
		Yes, that's fine. I'll	
		messenger it over to you 	
		tomorrow.
	
				PETER
		I don't want it. Ben... I
		think it would be best if you 
		didn't contact me again.
	
	And he turns and walks away, back to his table.
	
	
	CUT TO BLACK:
	
	TITLE ON BLACK; 'LAS VEGAS - 1.20 A.M.'
	
	FADE UP ON:
	
	2 EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
	
	Las Vegas. A blaze of color in the middle of a desert.
	
	Credit sequence begins.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	3 INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	A mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense 
	of activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts 
	across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense 
	texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an 
	insane New Age symphony.
	
	Credit sequence ends.
		
	Into the lobby from the street comes Sera.
	
	It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between 
	twenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American 
	girl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears 
	catalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt 
	and matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. 
	Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's 
	clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their 
	glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. 
	She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many 
	execs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language 
	is a bit different, though.
	
	4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	A view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up 
	and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
	We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls 
	focus and we see reflected in the glass...
	
	...a group of people.
	
	On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and 
	sandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two 
	boxers pound the shit out of each other.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	5 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in 
	the elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens 
	her lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs 
	higher. We see from the indicator that she has punched 
	the Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we 
	see that she is nervous but concealing it well. The 
	elevator stops, the doors open and she steps right 
	into the Penthouse.
	
	6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
	
	A bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. 
	He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, 
	a big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair 
	is greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, 
	all gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in 
	business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late 
	thirties listen to him.
	
				YURI
		...but please, my friends, 	
		call me Yuri. It is my 	
		American name... I picked it 	
		myself.
	
	The three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in 
	the way that they speak to Yuri.
	
				FIRST BUSINESSMAN
		Where are you from, Yuri? I 	
		mean, you sure don't talk 	
		like you're from this neck of 
		the woods. 
	
	Yuri smiles at them.
	
				YURI
			(silky voice)
		No... you are right, my 	
		friend. How very observant 	
		you are. I am from Latvia.
		
				WEIRD WOMAN
		Tough place.
	
				YURI
		Yes, I hear this too. But I 	
		am not a tough man. I am a 	
		simple man who is here to 	
		learn from my new American 	
		friends.
	
	The door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.
	
				WEIRD WOMAN
			(turned on)
		Is this your friend, Yuri?
		
				YURI
		Ah, yes... Sera.
	
	The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from 
	his inside pocket.
	
				YURI(cont'd)
		Sera is my gift to you, my 	
		friends from New York City. 	
		You may do with her as you 	
		wish in this beautiful room, 	
		which is also my gift for the 
		night to my friends. You will 
		find her a very willing girl, 
		for all of you...just as we 	
		arranged.
	
	Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the 
	envelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the 
	idea of her.
		
			SECOND BUSINESSMAN
		Of course, Yuri. I think 	
		you'll find this just as we 	
		discussed.
		
	Yuri gets up.
	
				YURI
		So, my friends... I have other 
		business to attend. Enjoy.
		
		
	He heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as 
	he passes.
	
				SERA
			(whispering)
		Yuri... please! Can I talk to 	
		you for a moment.
		
		
	Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the 
	bedroom.
	
	
				YURI

	Mirrors reflect mirrors.
	
				SERA
		I don't want this. Yuri, 	
		please. I really don't want

		to do groups.
	
				YURI
			(playful)
		I want this, Sera. I need 	
		this!   
		
					SERA
		Please, Yuri.
		
		
		
	He holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with one 
	arm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed.
	
				YURI
			(seductive)
		These are pretty.
	
	Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal 
	her buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other 
	hand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks 
	gently, like a father to a daughter.
	
				YURI(cont'd)
		Is this how you would repay 	
		me for coming all this way to 
		find you again? Driving 	
		through the desert to protect 
		my little Sera.

	ANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR
	
	Sera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning 
	her jacket.
	
	She takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips 
	her skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and 
	playing the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.

	10 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
	
	The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is 
	a very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los 
	Angeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five 
	customers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is 
	sitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress 
	and the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces 
	before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. 
	Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves 
	in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit 
	from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the 
	TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles 
	to himself.
	
	BEN'S POV OF TV
	
	The talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the 
	audience the prizes available in today's game show.
	
	ANGLE ON BEN
	
	As he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera 
	moves in close on his eyes. 
	
	BEN'S POV OF TV
	
	She turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV 
	camera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is 
	saying makes complete sense, but then things change...
	
				HOSTESS
			(smoky, sexy voice)
		Just look at this studio, 	
		Ben, filled with glamorous 	
		merchandise, including an 	
		extra special prize chosen 	
		just for You! A big, bad, BMW 
		motorcycle, complete with 	
		saddle bags stuffed with 	
		thousands of US dollars.
	
	"There are oohs" from the audience.
	
	
				HOSTESS
		So, Ben,
			(tosses her hair)
		Let's find a bar, get drunk 	
		and go for a ride.
	
	The studio lights dim.
	
				HOSTESS
		Then we can get a suite 	
		somewhere and order up a case 
		of champagne while we fuck 	
		ourselves silly.
	
	Close-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.
	
				HOSTESS
		This is it, just for You,
		Ben. 
	
	She unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her 
	nipples hard.
	
				HOSTESS
		Because You've been so 
		patient, and because I want 
		to fuck you, take care of 
		You, and because there's 
		nothing else in the world 
		worth doing.
	
	Section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their 
	eyes.
	
				HOSTESS
		Tell you what, Ben, let's go 
		to Las Vegas. The bars stay 
		open twenty four hours night 
		and day. Just you, just me, 
		Ben, think about it, all 
		right? 
	
	ANGLE ON BEN
	
	Lost in his fantasy
	
				BEN
		I'll think about it.
	
	He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to 
	what is known as "normal". He finishes his drink and then an 
	attack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls 
	his neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. 
	Ben looks at his own hands...which are steady.
	
				BARMAN
		You should go on that show.

	11 INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING
	
	Ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup 
	of black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with 
		framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed 
	with scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 
	'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on 
	the other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes 
	up to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of 
	messages down on the desk.
	
				BEN
		Yeah, but what's the back end 
		like? By the time we're 
		through with P and A, the 
		above-the line is going to 
		take it to about fifteen and 
		with something like this... I 
		don't know if Disney will go 
		for it... can I call you back 
		on this? OK... chow for now.
			(to the woman)
		Good morning.
	
	
				WOMAN
			(cautious)
		Ben... Mr. Simpson was looking 
		for you. I said that you had 
		a doctor's appointment. He 
		said for you to go in as soon 
		as... are you OK?
	
				BEN
			(pulling himself together)
		I'm fantastic, but I gotta go 
		out now... very important 
		meeting, could make a coupla 
		million for the company.
	
	Ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a 
	few steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face 
	gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and 
	she turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.
	
				WOMAN
			(tender)
		Ben?
	
				BEN
		What?
	
				WOMAN
		You should go now.
	
	She leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the 
	desk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his 
	whole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls 
	out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the 
		contents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the 
	room.

				BEN
			(genuinely moved) 
		This is to generous Peter.
	
				SIMPSON
			(close to tears)
		Well... we liked having you 
		around, Ben, but you know how 
		it is.
	
				BEN
			(ashamed)
		Sure thing... and I'm sorry.
	
	Ben takes a swig from his coffee cup.
	
				SIMPSON
			(trying to cheer things along)
		Well... what are you going to 
		do now?
	
				BEN
		I thought I might move out to

	Ben drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a 
	small bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty 
	bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
	
	He slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely 
	Teardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. 
	At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and 
	Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the 
	word "hot". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and 
	they both pull away.

	Ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows 
	him as he walks down the street. He looks at... 
	
	BEN'S POV
	
	A girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is 
	walking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's 
	thoughts.
	
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		Beautiful, no just the shape 
		which is nice, but the whole 
		walk, the feeling, the 
		movement. This girl is 
		pleased with herself. Maybe 
		this is the only art I can 
		appreciate... I don't know if 
		this is good or bad, but 
		right now she is really 
		beautiful. When I was a boy 
		it would have been really 
		important that she have a 
		pretty face, to go with this 
		body, I mean. I still would 
		like to see her face, but her 
		beauty is no dependent on her 
		face.
	
	The dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she 
	bends down to pull at its collar. 
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		I wonder what kind of panties 
		she's wearing. Shit, that's 
		too specific, but... on the 
		other hand, you can never be 
		too specific... but then, the 
		infinitesimal must be, by 
		definition, as infinite as 
		the infinite.
	
	Suddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot 
	resist looking into her face.
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		God, she's so young.
		
	The girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,

		Hi!

	15 EXT. BEN'S HOUSE IN SANT MONICA - DAY
	
	Ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. A 
	young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up 
	bike. Ben greets him.
	
				BEN
		Hey, Brad... how's it going?
	
				BRAD
		Hey Ben. There were a couple 
		of guys looking for you.
	
				BEN
		What did they look like?
	
				BRAD
		Suits. I didn't tell them 
		anything. You know anything 
		about gears?
	
	Ben takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of 
	shape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way 
	he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his 
	hands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the 
	chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
	
				BEN
		How'd this happen? 
	
				BRAD
		I was going real fast down on 
		the beach and something 
		slipped and everything got 
		jammed up.
	
				BEN
		The news is not good, kid. 
		This bit here... see 
		there... it's broken. You need 
		a new  one.
	
				BRAD
			(upset)
			How much, do you think?
	
				BEN
		I don't know. I'll find out 
		though.
	
	Ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. He 
	looks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking 
	totally dejected. This really seems to upset Ben.

	16 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
	
	Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. 
	The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He 
	pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up 
	the glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles 
	Davis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns 
	on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He 
	puts the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to 
	the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the 
	second track without any problem. The music starts and 
	continues through the next sequence.

	Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks 
	handsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets 
	up the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up 
	full and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He 
	tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. 
	In slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. 
	He smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a

	darkness. To get out of bed she would have to climb over him. 
	She lies still. Yuri speaks without opening his eyes... 
	
				YURI
		I missed you, Sera. You have 
		been lonely?
	
	Sera blinks and turns her head towards him.

		I'm older now, Yuri.

			(laughs)
		... wealth and luxury.
	
	He suddenly looks up from his food and smiles at her.
	
				YURI
		Why did you run away from me 
		in Los Angeles?
	
	Sera says nothing.
	
				YURI
		Because you are sly. Mmm? You 
		knew all along that there was 
		more money in Las Vegas. 
		Didn't you?
	
	Sera nervously plays with her food.
	
				YURI
		You have nothing to fear from

		Where have you been staying?

	He drops his fork.
	
				YURI
		But that is none of your

	The mood has changed and Sera does her best to move out of 
	these dangerous waters.
	
				SERA
		You'll need some money, then.
	
	Yuri nods. Sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds 
	money.

	Yuri is very angry and as Sera hands him the money, he hits 
	her, hard, knocking her back into the refrigerator. His ring 
	cuts her cheek.
				YURI
			(shouting)
		Don't look at me like that.
	
	And then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her. 
	He takes her face in his hands to look at the cut.

		It's not so bad. It is

		I need money, Sera. I need it

	a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. 
	She looks and sees Ben, and he smiles at her. She smiles 
	right back. Ben talks across the bar.

	Ben walks over to where she is. She is pleased that this 
	good-looking man has come over to make a play. She makes a 
	noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.
	
				BEN
		I'll get you another 
		one... and me too. Mind if I 
		join you?
	
	She watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks 
	back to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits 
	down. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she 
	smells the booze on him.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		Wow... been drinking all day?
	
				BEN
		But of course.
	
	She looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She 
	is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this 
	much is clear to Ben.
	
				BEN
		Why don't we finish these and 
		go to my apartment on the 
		beach?
	
	She doesn't respond.

	He stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.
	
				BEN
		No, OK.
	
	Ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the 
	bar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're 
	up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all 
	falls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of 
	great sadness comes over her.
	 
				PRETTY WOMAN
		I have to go now. Thanks 
		anyway.
	
	She stands to go.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		Maybe you shouldn't drink so 
		much.
	
	She walks to the door and Ben turns to the bar, watched by he 
	Barman, who is a little concerned.
	
				BEN
			(to himself)
		Maybe I shouldn't breathe so 
		much, Teri. Ha... ha.
	
				BARMAN
			(sever voice)
		Time to go, buddy... We're 
		closing up.
	
	Ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much 
	that he cannot extract any bills. He is very embarrassed and 
	tries again, but to no avail.

		Would you... ?
	
	The barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the

	There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign

		Just how much would it cost

	ANGLE ON THE STAGE
	
	A tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious 
	to the men who stare at her. The trio grinds out a dirty 
	blues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage 
	and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between 
	her legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and 
	a bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.
	
				WAITRESS

		Three-fifty.
	
	Ben puts down a hundred on to her tray.

	31 EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	Ben is cruising in his car, listening to 'Lonely Teardrops' 
	again. He's looking for a prostitute. He sees a girl, but 
	when he slows down she ducks into a doorway. 
	
	He looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up 
	fast. Ben panics for a second. There is a bottle between his 
	legs. The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a 
	while, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, 
	doing a U-turn.
		
	Ben continues and then sees an Hispanic girl and stops. He 
	winds down the window. He is by now almost incoherent.
	
				BEN
		Good evening.
	
	32 EXT. KERBSIDE - NIGHT
	
	The girl looks up and down the street and then walks over to 
	the car and bends down to the window.
	
				HISPANIC GIRL
		You wanna date? You wanna 
		date me?
	
	The girl's eyes shift constantly from Ben to the street and 
	then back again.
	
				BEN
			(cut to the chase)
		I'll give you a hundred 
		dollars for a straight forty-
		five minutes. You get the 
		room.
		
	Ben shows her the money. 
	
				HISPANIC GIRL
			(trying to take him)
		The room is twenty. You pay 
		for it.
	
	Ben laughs.
	
				BEN
		OK... but only because I think 
		that the concept of surrender 
		fits in with the big picture 
		right now. How about over 
		there?
	
	He gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the 
	street. She sets off and he gets out of the car. As he does, 
	a wave of nausea hits him. He shakes his head violently and 
	then lurches across the street, causing two cars to hit their 
	brakes. The camera follows him into the dark parking lot of 
	the motel, where the Hispanic girl is waiting.
	
				BEN
			(slurring badly)
		I canremember... if 
		mywifeleffme... or Illeff 
		her... bufuckittanyway... 
	
	The girl laughs at Ben and says something in Spanish.
	
	Slowly the picture gets darker, until all that can be seen is 
	the headlights from the passing cars on Sunset... and then... 
	
	33 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAWN
	
	Ben wakes up on the kitchen floor. The fridge door is open 
	and its light is what lights Ben. Inside the fridge are one 
	green pepper and four bottles of vodka. Without too much 
	effort Ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still 
	there, as are his car keys. He closes the fridge door and in 
	the green light from the window he lies still. The first 
	birds start singing. (the birdsong continues through the 
	following sequence, which does not have sync sound.)

	She looks at her computer read-out.

		Well... to tell you the truth,

	Ben seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him. The 
	Barman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes 
	some bills, shaking his head in disapproval. The TV is on, 
	some game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking 
	for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 
	'normal' fashion. The only difference is that the hostess is 
	played by the girl in the bank. Ben grabs the Barman's 
	attention.
	
				BEN
		I think, when I'm done with 
		this, I'll have gin and 
		tonic... Bombay gin and tonic.
		
	The Barman loses it
	
				BARMAN
			(angry)
		You should be having coffee. 
		Do you know what time it is? 
		You're a young man.
			(calmer)
		It's none of my business, but 
		if you could see what I see, 
		you wouldn't do this to 
		yourself.
	
	Ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice. In his mind, 
	cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out. He holds the 
	emotion back, and looks down at the bar.
	
				BEN
		I understand what you're 
		saying... I appreciate your 
		concern. Its not my intention 
		to make you uncomfortable. 
		Please... serve me today and I 
		will never come in here 
		again.
			(cheerful)
		If I do, you can eighty-six 
		me.
	
				BARMAN
		Sure, sure, I can eighty-six 
		you now if I want to. Stop 
		fucking with me. I don't give 
		a fuck what you do.
	
	He picks up a bottle of gin, fills a glass, slams it on the 
	counter in front of Ben and knocks twice with his knuckles on 
	the bar.

	On the house, son.

	Ben looks at the TV for a sign. None is forthcoming.

	Ben waiting in line again. The same Bank girl is there and 
	she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely 
	cheerful way that the game-show Hostess dealt with her prize-
	winners. She notices Ben waiting and an irritated look 
	flashes over across her face. Ben studies her. She is pretty 
	in an ordinary kind of way. We hear Ben's thoughts as voice-
	over (or maybe he says them out loud to himself).
	
				BEN
			(voice over)
		Are you desirable? Are you

	counting money, smiling, perfect teeth framed by a Cupid

	lingerie can just be made out.
	
				BEN
		If you drank bourbon with me 
		naked... if you smelled of 
		bourbon as you fucked me, it 
		would help... it would 
		increase my esteem for you. 
		If you poured bourbon on to 
		your naked body and said to 
		me... drink this... 
		
	Camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a 
	customer about the weather.
	
				BEN
		... if you spread your legs 
		and had bourbon dripping from 
		your breasts and you vagina 
		and said drink here... then I 
		could fall in love with you, 
		because then I would have a 
		purpose, to clean you up, and 
		that would prove that I'm 
		worth something. Id lick you 
		clean so you could go away 
		and fuck someone else.
		
					BANK GIRL
		Next!
	
	Ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie. He smiles and 
	comes to the counter, completely in control of himself.
	
				BEN
		I'm back, I've got my

	He flips the check over, makes sure she is watching and signs 
	with a flourish.
	
				BEN
		There... Steady as a fucking

		Wanna have dinner with me?
	
	She counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it

	And she walks a few steps to prove it, stopping on the 
	passenger side of his car. They pause for a moment and Ben is 
	confused. He is quite taken with her beauty, but this is not 
	going according to plan. He reaches into the car quickly and 
	picks an open can of bee, draining it before tossing the 
	empty back on to the rear seat.

		That is, if you'll come to my

		No, this is fine.  I was just

	Ben switches off the engine but makes no move to get out of 
	the car.
	
				BEN
		Well... I'm here because I'm a

		Umm. We can stay in the car

	There are bottles everywhere. Ben has gone to a lot of troble 
	to lay them out in a pleasing way. 
	
				BEN
		Do you think so?
	
		She turns and looks at him, appraising him. Suddenly she's 
	all business, in control, and Ben likes it.
	
				SERA
		Mind if I use the bathroom?
	
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	She goes into the bathroom.
	
				BEN
		Want a drink? I'm having one.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		A shot of tequila, if you can 
		spare it.
	
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	Ben smiles, happier than we've ever seen him. He gets her 
	order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon 
	bottle. He sits on the edge of the bed.
	
	The bathroom door opens and Sera comes in wearing a black bra 
	and panties. She's acting the hooker now, tough and sexy.
	
				SERA
		For two-fifty we can do 
		pretty much what you want. 
		You've been drinking, so it 
		might be better if I got on 
		top, but the other way's fine 
		too. I have some jelly in 
		case you want to fuck my ass, 
		that's up to you. If you want 
		to come in my face, that's OK 
		too, just try to keep it out 
		of my hair, I just washed 
		it... and my eyes, it stings.
		
	She walks to the table and downs her tequila in one. Then 
	comes to the bed, where Ben is sitting. She kneels, unzips 
	his fly and begins sucking him. Ben watches her, looks at her 
	reflection in the closet mirror, reaches for the bottle and 
	drinks some, being careful not to disturb Sera. After a while 
	Sera comes up.
	
				SERA
		Do you want to fuck now?
	
				BEN
			(confused)
		Maybe another drink first. 
			More tequila?
	
				SERA
		OK... whatever.
	
	She takes the bottle and drinks. She goes down again. Ben 
	stops her.
	
				SERA
		What's the story? Are you too 
		drunk to come?
	
				BEN
			(sincere)
		I don't care about that. 
		There's time left. You can 
		have more money. You can 
		drink all you want. You can 
		talk or listen. Just stay,

	She looks at him, confused. She sees a strange look on his 
	face. It throws her.
	
	This is a turning point. Both of them are momentarily 
	exposed.

		sixteen years old on 
		Hollywood Boulevard?
		
	Yuri talks in Russian, becoming angrier, and slaps her again. 
	He spits on the floor.
	
	Sera falls against the kitchen table and picks up a lethal-
	looking knife. Yuri stops. 
	
				SERA
		Maybe nobody wants to fuck a 
		chick with a cut on her 
		cheek.
		
	She throws the knife to Yuri, who catches it. She bends over 
	the table and pulls up her skirt.
	
				SERA
		There, go ahead!
	
	She mimics him.
	
	A shower of Russian comes out of Yuri, but he doesn't touch 
	her. He tries to regain his dignity by putting on a coat.
	
				YURI
		I could kill you. You know 
		that.
	
	He goes to the door.
	
				YURI
		Work, tonight, bring me 
		money, no matter the hour.
	
	And he exits. Sera is still on the table.
	
				SERA
		I will Yuri. I will.

	67 INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
	
	The proprietor is handling over some cash to Yuri, whose 
	jewelry is on the counter. He pockets it and as he turns to 
	leave, Ben comes in. They pass without taking much notice of 
	each other. Ben removes his Rolex and shows it to the man. 
	
	CUT TO:
	
	68 EXT. STREET, LAS VEGAS - DAY
	
	Yuri is walking in the hot sun, sweating. We see him through 
	long-lens heat haze. The camera wanders into the traffic and 
	we see the black Town Car crawling along behind him, three men 
	inside.

	Improvised scene. (4)
	
	CUT TO:
	
	70 INT. MAIN BAR, HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	A lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a Tony Orlando 
	number. Sera sits at the bar, an empty seat on either side of 
	her. She watches a younger hooker in the final moments of 
	pulling a dangerous-looking man. The girl is aware of Sera 
	without even looking at her. The guy she is with looks around 
	and sees Sera. The girl shoots an icy look. A man sits next 
	to Sera: a conventioneer.
	
				CONVENTIONEER
		About ready for another 
		drink?
	
				SERA
		Yes, that would be great. Are 
		you her for the convention?
	
				CONVENTIONEER
		Do I look that obvious? My 
		name's Paul.
	
	They shake hands.
	
				SERA
		No, of course not, just a 
		wild guess. I'm Sera and 
		that's a margarita.
	
		The barman is already pouring. The young hooker leaves with 
	her dangerous guy. She pauses long enough to give Sera a 
	nasty smile. The conventioneer pays for the drink and is a 
	little lost for words. Sera tries to help.
	
				SERA
		So... are you alone, or are 
		you just using me to make 
		someone else jealous?
	 
				CONVENTIONEER
			(laughs nervously)
		Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
	
				SERA
			(friendly)
		Where are you staying?
	
				CONVENTIONEER
			(suspicious)
		Right here at the hotel. Why?
	
				SERA
			(moving a little closer)
		Well... I thought you might be 
		looking for a date.
	
				CONVENTIONEER
			(shocked)
		A date. What, are you a 
		hooker?
			(voice getting louder)
		What do you mean a date?
			(and louder)
		I've got a wife back home. I 
		just came over to talk for a 
		few minutes.
		
				SERA
			(quietly)
		I'm sorry, I guess I 
		misunderstood.
	
	She looks around.
	
				SERA
		Please don't raise your 
		voice. I won't bother you 
		about it again.
		
				CONVENTIONEER
			(calmer)
		Sorry. Look... you seem like a 
		nice girl. I'm just sick of 
		everyone in this town trying 
			to get my money.
	
	He gets up.
	
				CONVENTIONEER
		Here, have another drink. I 
		gotta go.
	
	He leaves. Sera is uncomfortable. People are watching her, 
	aware that something has been going on. The Barman comes over 
	to where Sera is sitting.
	
				BARMAN
		Maybe you should give it a 
		miss for this evening.
	
	He walks away. Sera finishes her drink and leaves.

	71 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Sera at work is looking more carefully than usual, hoping to 
	see Ben. A huge silver limo pulls up and, after some 
	negotiation, she gets in. 
	
	CUT TO:
	
	72 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Long-lens shot of Ben, very drunk on the street. He falls and 
	lies still for quite a long time before getting up. He falls 
	into the road and tries to hail a cab, but none stops. A cop 
	car cruises to a halt and Ben more or less imitates a normal 
	person as he walks out of shot.
	
	73 EXT. THE POOL, MOTEL - DAY
	
	Ben dives in and swims a length under water. He pulls himself 
	out and sits next to the large Midwestern family. The father 
	says hello and introduces his family to Ben. They are all 
	very friendly. It's a nice atmosphere around this pool and 
	for a moment Ben even looks healthy.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	74 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	A limo pulls up and Sera gets out. She sees something.
	
	SERA'S POV
	
	Ben sitting at a bus stop, drinking out of a cocktail glass. 
	When he sees her he gets up, a little unsteadily.
	
					BEN
		I couldn't remember what 
		happened last time. I was 
		afraid that I might have been 
		rude, or mean to you.
		
	He looks at her.
	
				BEN
		If I was I'm sorry.
	
				SERA
		No, just drunk... but that's 
		OK. Where's your car?
	
				BEN
		I sold it this morning. I'm 
		going to take cabs from now 
		on in.
	
	Sera looks up and down the strip.
	
				BEN
		Don't run away.
	
				SERA
			(defensive)
		Why should I? I know you're 
		not a cop, so what is it 
		tonight? Another two-fifty to 
		watch you sleep?
	
	Ben sits down, a little hurt.
	
				SERA
		What's up?
	
				BEN
		I was looking for you 
		tonight. I don't know if you 
		have a boyfriend... 
		
	He thinks.
	
				BEN
		... or a girlfriend, but if 
		you have some free 
		time... maybe we could have 
		dinner.
	
				SERA
			(tough again, but pleased)
		Are you serious.
	
				BEN
				(deadly serious)
		I think you know I'm serious. 
		I'll pay you if you 
		like... but I'd like to see 
		you.
	
				SERA
		No, I can't have dinner with 
		you.
	
	And she hails a taxi, which stops immediately and she gets 
	in.
	 
				SERA
		The Mojave Hotel, please.
	
	Ben watches the cab drive off.
	 
	CUT TO:
	
	75 INT. CORRIDOR OF HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Sera walks along, checking numbers on the doors. She finds 
	the right one and knocks firmly.
	
				YURI (v.o)
		Yes? What?
	
				SERA
		It's me, Yuri.
	
	The door opens a crack and Yuri peers out.
	
				YURI
		Sera! It's... 
	
	He looks around for a clock.
	
				YURI
		... it's late.
	
	76 INT. YURI'S ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out 
	seven hundred dollars.
	
				SERA
		Sorry, Yuri... good 
		night... lots of tricks... I 
		think things are picking up.
		
	Yuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His 
	face is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be 
	listening for something, because he stops her talking by 
	putting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then 
		beckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the 
	bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a 
	wave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri 
	seems to be deranged.
	
				YURI
		Have you told anyone that I'm 
		here?
	
				SERA
		No.
	
	Yuri suddenly hears something. He grabs Sera's hand and takes 
	her to the wall. He presses her head to the wall.
	
				YURI
		Do you here that?
	
	He looks at her.
	
				YURI
		They're talking about me.
	
	He pulls himself together.
	
				YURI
		Go, Sera.
			(whispers)
		Go. Stay at home. I will call 
		you tomorrow.
				SERA
		Yuri... are you... 
	
				YURI
			(patiently)
		Sera... please go.
	
	He indicates the wall.
	
				YURI
		This is very important... and 
		I must listen. Now go.
	
	They face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an 
	almost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the 
	door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her 
	blouse. He slams the door. 
	
				YURI
			(through the door)
		Goodbye, Sera. Don't come 
		back here. I will not see you 
		again.
	
	Sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she 
		begins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way 
	down the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men 
	are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they 
	make their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn 
	a corner. We recognize them as the men from the black 
	Town Car.
	
	ANGLE
	
	The men have stopped outside Yuri's room. The camera pans and 
	we see Sera down the other corridor getting into the 
	elevator.
	
	FADE OUT:
	
	77 INT. BEN'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Ben is lying on the bed watching a game show, drinking.
	
	A coughing fit hits him. He is very short of breath. We see 
	how ill he really is.
	
	There is a tap at the door.
	
				BEN
		No thanks... I'm fine.
	
	The tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and 
	unlocks it, but keeps the chain on. It is Sera.
	
				SERA
		Still want to have dinner?
	
	Ben stares at her for a while.
	
				BEN
		Yes.
	
				SERA
		I have to change and take a 
		shower first. If you want to 
		come home and wait.
	
	Ben opens the door.
	
				SERA
		We should pick up a bottle of 
		tequila on the way. I owe you 
		one.
	 
				BEN
		You do?
	
	CUT TO:
	
	78 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Sera is finishing in the shower and Ben is sitting at the 
	kitchen table. He gets up and walks around the house, trying 
	to get a sense of her. The furniture is very plain and there 
	is spartan quality about the hose. He looks with interest at 
	the bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature. 
	
				BEN
			(to himself)
		This is the home of an angel.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		You OK out there?
	
				BEN
		Yes. Take your time. I'm 
		fine.
	
	He pours himself another drink.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		Pour yourself another drink.
	
	He sots down and she comes in, toweling her hair.
	
				SERA
		You OK?
	
				BEN
		Of course. Wow... you look 
		extremely beautiful.
	
				SERA
		Thank you. What time is it?
	
				BEN
		Don't know. My watch went the 
		way of the car.
	
	He holds up his empty wrist for her to see. Then looks up and 
	sees her watching him.
	
				BEN
		I'm rambling. I really like 
		you. You make me want to 
		talk... I don't know what time 
		it is.
	
				SERA
		I like hearing you talk.
			(businesslike)
		If you feel up to a short 
		walk, there's a place to eat 
		around the corner. All the 
		food in Vegas is terrible so 
		the place doesn't really 
		matter. How does that sound 
		to you?
	
				BEN
		Do they have drinks?
	
	CUT TO:
	
	79 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Ben and Sera walk and talk.
	
	80 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
	
	Ben and Sera are eating. He plays with his food, eating very 
	little of it. Finally he pushes it away and orders another 
	drink.
	
				SERA
		I'm from the East. I went to 
		college, did an arts course. 
		I now live in Vegas. I think 
		of it as home. I came here 
		deliberately to carve out a 
		life. I was in LA before, but 
		I'll come back to that later.
			(pause)
		The tough times are behind me 
		now. I can deal with the bad 
		things that happen. There 
		will always be dark 
		characters. But my life is 
		good. It is as I would want 
		it to be. So, why are you a 
		drunk? 
	
				BEN
		Is that really what you want 
		to ask me? 
	
				SERA
		Yes.
	
				BEN
			(worried)
		Well, then I guess this is 
		our first date... or our last. 
		Until now, I wasn't sure it 
		was either.
		 
				SERA
		Very clever.
	
		Sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on 
	this.
	
				SERA
		First. It's our first. I'm 
		just concerned. So... why are 
		you killing yourself?
	
	
				BEN
		Interesting choice of words. 
		I don't remember. I just know 
		that I want to.
		
				SERA
		Want to kill yourself? Are 
		you saying  that you're 
		drinking as a way to kill 
		yourself?
	
	And she leans across the table to be close to him, listening 
	intently. Ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off. 
	
				BEN
		Or killing myself as a way to 
		drink.
	
	Sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real 
	answer. He takes a slug from his drink. She sits back.
	
				BEN
		We'll talk about it some 
		other time maybe. OK?
	
	Sera relaxes and continues with her food. We hear her 
	thoughts for a moment.
	
				SERA (v.o)
		It wasn't so important to me. 
		I mean, he never asked me why 
		I was a hooker, sand that was 
		impressive. I really liked 
		him. So I decided to just 
		play my part. I mean... it's 
		good to help someone once in 
		a while., it's a bonus to 
		being alive, and that was my 
		plan... to stay alive. I 
		suddenly came to a decision.
	
				BEN
		What are you thinking? Are 
		you angry with me?
		 
				SERA
				(decides something)
		Ben, why don't you stay at my 
		place tonight? I mean... look, 
		you're so drunk. I like you. 
		I trust you.
	
				BEN
		That's astonishing. Sera, 
		look... 
	
				SERA
		I hate to think of you in 
		that cheesy motel. I mean... 
	
	And she folds her arms and grins at him.
	
				SERA
		Let's face it, what the fuck 
		are you doing in Las Vegas?
	
				BEN
			(overwhelmed by her)
		I'm going to move to a smart 
		hotel, tomorrow if it'll make 
		you feel better.
			(looks at her)
		Let's talk about tomorrow. 
		Wanna do something?
	
				SERA
			(warmly)
		Sure... tonight. Then please 
		stay at my place.
	
				BEN
		Sera... you know I'm not much 
		good in the sack.
	
				SERA
		It's not about sex, Ben. I'll 
		make you up a bed on the 
		sofa. Do it for me. We can 
		talk till late and then sleep 
		till late. As you know, I am 
		my own boss.
		
	Ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his 
	laugh as infectious, and Sera join in. Other diners turn to 
	stare at them. They seem like a couple.

				BEN
		How long have I been her?
	
				SERA
		Three nights, two days. When 
		is your rent coming up at the 
		motel?
	
				BEN
		I don't know.
			(sits up)
		I'll go and sort it out 
		today. Why don't you 
		come?... We'll find a real 
		room for me. You can pick it 
		out, a tower on the strip.
		
				SERA
		There's no reason to blow all 
		your money on a hotel room.
		
					BEN
		What do you mean?
	
				SERA
		What I mean is that you 
		should bring your stuff over 
		here. We're spending all this 
		time together... what the 
		fuck!
	
				BEN
		Sera... 
	
				SERA
		Let's face it, Ben, we're 
		having fun here. I've never 
		done so much talking in my

				BEN
			Me neither.
	
				SERA
		So! Let's dispense with the 
		formalities. I want you 
		here... now!
	
				BEN
		Sera you are crazy.
	
				SERA
		So... I'm not too concerned 
		with long term plans.
	
				BEN
		Don't you think you'll get a 
		little bored living with a 
		drunk?
	
				SERA
		That is what I want. Why 
		don't you go and get your 
		stuff?
		
				BEN
		You haven't seen the worst of 
		it. These last few days I've 
		been very controlled. I knock 
		things over... I throw up all 
		the time.
			(looks at her)
		Now I feel really 
		good... You're like some kind 
		of antidote that mixes the 
		liquor and keeps me in 
		balance, but that won't last 
		forever. You'll get tired of 
		it really quickly. Believe 
		me.
		
	They sit in silence for a while.
	
				SERA
		OK, you go back to your hotel 
		and I'll go back to my 
		glamorous life of being 
		alone.
		
	She walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she 
	sits on the toilet to pee.
	
				SERA
			(to herself)
		The only thing I have to come 
		home to is a bottle of 
		Listerine to wash the taste 
		of come out of my mouth. I'm 
		tired of being alone... that's 
		what I'm tired of.
		
	She finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet. Pulling 
	up her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where Ben is 
	putting on his shoes. 
	
				SERA
		Don't you like me, Ben?
	
				BEN
			(devastated)
		Don't be silly?
	
	Ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in 
	love with her. He walks out of the room. She foolows.
	
				SERA
		We gotta decide this... right 
		now. Before we go any 
		further. You either stay here 
		with me or... 
	
	Ben turns to look at her.
	
				SERA
		... we can't see each other 
		any more.
		
	Ben and Sera look at each other for a long time.
	
				BEN
		Sera... what you don't 
		understand is... 
		 
				SERA
		What?
	
	Ben is deeply troubled. He comes to a decision.
	
				BEN
		You can never... never... ask 
		me to stop drinking. Do you 
		understand?
	
				SERA
			(dead serious)
		I do. I really do.
			(smiles)
		OK. I have to do some 
		shopping alone. You go out 
		for a few drinks and then 
		pick up your things. Don't 
		hurry and I'll be back before 
		you to let you in.
		
	Sera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance

	talks to himself.
	
				BEN
		Maybe this isn't a good idea 
		after all.
		
	He tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid 
	won't close. He sits on the bed and has an imaginary

		Listen, angel... the thing is

	Sera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside

				HUSBAND
		We didn't know whether to

	And they indicate the sleeping figure of Ben, in the doorway, 
	clutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow.
	
					WIFE
		He's been there for about

		thought he'd seen you two 
		together, but I thought it

				SERA
		Yes, he's my friend. I guess

		Thanks for the concern. Sorry

		Well, call me if there's

		Can you wake up?
	
	Ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful 
	expression.
	
				BEN
		Hi!
	
				SERA
		Why don't you go in and sit

				BEN
		Right... OK... 
	
	Ben stands and almost loses his balance. He picks up his 
	suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but 
	she stop him.
	
				SERA
		Don't worry... I got'em.
	
	Ben staggers in with his case. As Sera enters, she looks

				BEN (off-screen)
			Want a drink? Great nap. 
		Wanna go out tonight?
	
				SERA
		Seriously, Ben... I need to

		could nap this side of the 
		door. That was the landlord.
		
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	She reaches into her purse.
	
				SERA
		Gift number one.
	
	And she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it 
	in the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
	
				BEN
		I used to carry a lot of 
		keys, but one by one they all 
		fell victim to the great 
		condensation. Now I have just

		this month. All right?
		
	And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen 
	until this matter is resolved.
	
				SERA
		Why?
	
				BEN
		Because... it's better for me 
		that way. OK?
	
				SERA
		Well... OK... 
	
	She is uncomfortable.
	
	They sit in silence for a while.
	
				BEN
		Sera... I hope that you 
		understand how I feel about 
		this. First of all, you're 
		welcome to my money. We can 
		buy a couple of cases of 
		liquor and you can have the 
		rest. But I don't think 
		you're talking to me right 
		now about money.
		
				SERA
			(smiling)
		No?
	
				BEN
		No. I think you're talking 
		about you. I'll tell you 
		right now that I'm in love 
		with you... but, be that as it 
		may, I'm not here to force my 
		twisted life into your soul.
		
				SERA
		I know that... 
		
				BEN
		... and I'm not here to demand 
		your attention to the point 
		where it changes your life. 
		We know I'm a drunk... but 
		that seems to be all right 
		with you. And I know that 
		you're a hooker. I hope you 
		understand that I'm a person 
		who is totally at ease with 
		this... which is not to say 
		that I'm indifferent or that 
		I don't care... I do... it 
		simply means that I trust and 
		accept your judgement. What 
		I'm saying is... that I hope 
		you understand that I 
		understand.
		
				SERA
		Thanks, I do understand. I 
		was worried about how that 
		would be... but now I'm not. 
		And you should know that 
		included with the rent here 
		is a complimentary blow job.
		
				BEN
		Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or 
		later we ought to fuck.
	
				SERA
		Whatever that means. Open 
		your presents.
	
	She hands him the larger of the two parcels.
	
				SERA
		Open this one first.
	
	Ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A 
	genuine smile comes on to his face.
	
				BEN
		Very nice.
	
	He holds the shirt against himself.
	
				BEN
		This should work very nicely 
		with my suit, which, by the 
		way, is the only item of 
		clothing I brought over from 
		the motel with me.
			
	Sera raise an eyebrow.
	
				SERA
		Right... the suitcase was 
		clinking. So what did you do 
		with your clothes?
		
				BEN
			(laughing)
		I threw them into the 
		garbage., which was perhaps 
		immoral, but I wanted to come 
		to you clean, so to speak. I 
		thought we could go shopping 
		and pick up a pair of jeans 
		and forty-five pairs of 
		underwear and just throw them 
		out each day.
		
				SERA
			(smiling)
		Nice talk, Ben. Keep 
		drinking. In between the 
		hundred and one proof breath 
		and the occasional drool, 
		some interesting words fall 
		from your mouth.
		
	She hands him the last present.
	
				SERA
		Now, try this one.
	
	Ben unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He 
	is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
	 
				BEN
		Well... looks like I'm with 
		the right girl.
		
	He turns it in his hands.
	
				BEN
		I must say that I'm very 
		impressed that you would buy 
		this for me. I know you 
		wouldn't do this without 
		thinking about it. 
		Funny... you did just what I 
		would have done.
		
	Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is 
	fine. He walks to the door.
	
					BEN
		I'm going to fill it right 
		now.
	
				SERA
		Do you want to go gambling 
		tonight? We could go out and 
		play for a few hours.
		
	Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit 
	pocket and has a drink.
	
				BEN
		I hadn't planned to 
		gamble... but if you would 
		keep the bulk of my money 
		here, then I could safely 
		blow a couple of hundred 
		bucks.
		
	He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and 
	then gives her the rest.
	
				BEN
		Giving you money makes me 
		want to come.
	
				SERA
		Then come.
			(pause)
		I'm going to change. Watch 
		TV. I'll be half an hour.
	
	And she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben 
	is not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the 
	small angle of the door as she changes.
	
				SERA
		I am planning to go out and 
		do some work.
	
				BEN
		When?
	
				SERA
		Tomorrow night as a matter of 
		fact.
	
	88 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Ben and Sera walking. The camera follows them. He is wearing 
	his new shirt and looks good in it. She is wearing a green 
	dress and mismatched earrings and looks great. They walk and 
	talk.
	
					BEN
		I like your earrings.
	
	He changes sides.
	
				BEN
		I like women who wear 
		mismatched earrings.
	
				SERA
		Well, then... I hope we don't 
		run into any tonight.
	
				BEN
			(laughs)
		What do you mean?
	
				SERA
		I expect some kind of loyalty 
		here. Just because I fuck for 
		money doesn't give you cause 
		to start picking up women and 
		leaving me looking silly.
		
	And she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious. 
	
				BEN
		And I only have eyes for you. 
		And we both know that you 
		would never become 
		romantically involved with a 
		trick, right?
		
	89 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
	
	They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and 
	energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a 
	slot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and 
	then she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some 
	change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a 
	beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to 
	the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. 
	They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As 
	he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his 
	arm. 
	
				SERA
			(quietly)
		I love you.
	
	But he doesn't hear her.
	
	ANGLE ON CASINO ACTIVITY
	
	On long lens we see Ben and Sera at the bar. Suddenly Ben 
		seems to fall asleep. Sera tries to wake him and then he goes 
	crazy and falls backwards off his stool, knocking a waitress 
	and her drinks over. Security Guards appear and begin arguing 
	with Sera.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	90 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. A night-light gives 
	a soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on 
	the floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door 
	and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With 
	difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a 
	drink. He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just 
	in case he has to vomit.
	
	91 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sera wakes and Ben comes in and gets into bed with her.
	
				SERA
		How are you doing?
	
				BEN
		Very well... umm... I never 
		expected to have to ask you 
		this again... but how did our 
		evening go? I remember 
		getting to the casino... I 
		remember kissing you... that 
		was really nice but 
		everything after that is a 
		blank.
		
				SERA
		Well - I was prepared for 
		worse, but it wasn't so bad. 
		We were sitting at the bar, 
		talking about blackjack. You 
		seemed just fine, a little 
		drunker than usual, but 
		nothing really strange, but 
		then your head started to 
		droop and I put my arm on 
		your shoulder and then, wham, 
		you swung you arm at me, and 
		fell backwards off your stool 
		into a cocktail waitress. You 
		smashed everything on her 
		tray, it was a real mess. You 
		kept yelling and yelling.
		
				BEN
		Oh, and what did you do?
		
				SERA
		I tried to shut you up and 
		help you to your feet but you 
		kept swinging at me - not 
		like you wanted to hit me, 
		but more just waving me away. 
		Security came and when you 
		saw them you stopped yelling. 
		They wanted to carry you out 
		and dump you on the street, 
		but I talked them into 
		letting me walk you out.
		
				BEN
		That's impressive. How did 
		you do that?
	
				SERA
		I told them you were an 
		alcoholic and T would take 
		you home. I also promised 
		that we would never come in 
		there again.
		
				BEN
		We?
	
				SERA
		Yes, we.
	
				BEN
			(holds her hand)
		What happened then?
	
				SERA
		You were OK for a while, so 
		we walked for about a block 
		and then you said you wanted 
		to go home and fuck, but I 
		think even you knew that 
		wasn't going to happen. We 
		got a cab and you asked him 
		to stop at a liquor store, 
		even though I told you that 
		we had plenty at home. In the 
		store you gave the kid a 
		hundred and told him to keep 
		the change. I asked you if 
		you knew it was a hundred. 
		You said you did, so I let 
		you do it. We got here, you 
		fell asleep on the couch and 
		I covered you up and came to 
		bed.
			
				BEN
		I warned you... 
			(kisses her hand)
		... but I'm sorry.
	
				SERA
		Here's my speech... 
			(kisses his hand)
		... I know this shouldn't be 
		acceptable to m, but it is. 
		Don't ask me why. I sense 
		that your trouble is very 
		big... and I'm scared for 
		you... and so I'm doing what I 
		think you need me to do. 
		Falling down in casinos is 
		little stuff. It doesn't 
		bother me. It has nothing to 
		do with us.
		
				BEN
		That's amazing. What are you? 
		Some sort of angel visiting 
		me from one of my drunk 
		fantasies? How can you be so 
		good?
		
	She turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
	
				SERA
		I don't know what you're 
		saying. I'm just using you. I 
		need you. Can we not talk 
		about it any more, please. 
		Not another word.
		
	He thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying 
	on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes 
	her naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.
	
				BEN
		Why don't you go back to 
		sleep. I'll go out and buy us 
		some breakfast.
		
				SERA
		Be careful.
	
	He stands and goes to the door.
	
				BEN
		Don't worry.
	
	As he leaves the room, she calls after him.
		
				SERA
		Ben, I'm  working tonight.
	
	He opens the door and smiles at her.
	
				BEN
		I know.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	92 EXT. SIDEWALK - EARLY MORNING
	
	Ben gets out of his  cab and walks up to the doorway of a 
	grocery store. It is locked. Ben looks at his wrist and then 
	remembers that he no longer has a watch. He looks around, 
	sees something and exits frame.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	93 INT. ROUGH ENGLISH BAR - EARLY MORNING
	
	Ben enters and makes his way to the bar. This is a dirty, 
	dark place. An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing 
	by herself at the jukebox. A very drunk Biker Couple argue 
	noisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much 
	gambling taking place at the eight slot machines. Ben sits at 
	the bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin.
	
				BEN
		A beer and a double kamikaze 
		please.
	
				BARTENDER
		Sure thing. Anything to eat?
	
				BEN
		Not quite yet. First I have 
		to drink myself sober, 
		then... a few crackers, maybe 
		an egg and toast... 
		
	The Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues 
	anyway.
	
				BEN
		... then I'll go home with the 
		groceries and we'll have 
		breakfast together, and 
		that'll make her feel better 
		about my condition... 
		
	Ben is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl. She is 
	young tough and pretty. She puts an arm around him and 
	presses against him.
		
				BIKER GIRL
		Who the fuck are you talking 
		to, Mr?
			(laughing)
		Why are you all dressed up, 
		honey? My, don't you look 
		fine.
	
	She runs her tongue around her mouth.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		I am very bored with my date. 
		Would you like to buy me a 
		drink?
	
	Ben looks around and sees the Biker staring at the two of 
	them.
	
				BEN
			(loudly)
		Do you mind if I buy her a 
		drink?
		
				BIKER
		Fuck her. I don't care what 
		the fuck you do with her.
		
				BEN
		Maybe I could buy you both a 
		drink?
	
				BIKER
		Fuck you. Don't fuck with me, 
		motherfucker. Fuck off. Go to 
		it, she's waiting for her 
		drink.
	
	The Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping 
	in quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		See what an asshole he is.
			(big smile)
		I'll have a rum and Coke.
	
				BEN
		Barman? A rum and Coke, 
		please.
	
	The Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who  
	is facing the bar on a stool. She brings her face closer to 
	his.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Can I stay with you for a 
		while?
	
				BEN
		You mean move in with me? 
		Isn't this a bit sudden?
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Oh, I don't have a lot of 
		stuff.
		
				BEN
			(smiling)
		I don't think my wife would 
		dig it too much.
	
	She moves to his ear to whisper.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Maybe we could just go find a 
		room and fuck all day. You 
		wouldn't have to tell your 
		wife about that, would you? I 
		could suck you like this.
		
	And she begins sucking on his lobe. Behind them. At the slot 
	machine the Biker is still watching. His face fills with a 
	drunken rage.
	
				BEN
		See, the thing is... fucking 
		you would be wonderful, but I 
		am deeply in love with 
		Sera... 
		
	The Biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.
	
				BEN
		... and it's almost impossible 
		for me to imagine being with 
		someone else... 
		
	The Biker arrives at the bar and grabs Ben.
	
				BIKER
		Now listen, asshole, I'm not 
		gonna just sit around and 
		watch her suck on your ear.
		
	The Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back. He leans in 
	and puts his face next to Ben's.
	
				BIKER
		Now, I know that she came 
		over to you, like she does, 
			so I'm gonna pretend that 
		you're innocent and give you 
		one chance to walk out of 
		this place... right now.
		
				BIKER GIRL
			(to biker)
		Get lost, jerk.
	
	The Biker slaps her and then grabs Ben by the collar.
	
				BIKER
		What do you say?
	
	Ben shakes his arm free from the Biker's grip. He thinks 
	about it for a couple of beats and then decides.
	
				BEN
		I'm sorry... but she and I 
		have decided to spend a few 
		hours together in a mo -
		
	The Biker headbutts Ben in the face, sending him crashing off 
	his stool to the floor. His head cracks against the tiled 
	floor. The Biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt 
	front and punches him in the nose. Blood sprays on to his 
	face. The Biker walks out of the bar. The Girl follows him 
	quickly. The Bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to 
	where Ben is struggling to get up, holding his face. 
	
				BARTENDER
		You're quite a fighter.
	
	He gives him the towel.
	
				BARTENDER
		This may sound silly, but I'm 
		going to have to ask you to 
		leave. It's what we do around 
		here  when there's a fight. 
		Men's room is around the 
		back.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	94 EXT. SERA'S HOUSE - MORNING
	
	Ben lets himself in with his key. He is carrying a big bag of 
	groceries. His clothes are bloodstained. The Landlady watches 
	from poolside.
	
				BEN
		I'm back.
	
	He walks into the living room and finds Sera reading on the 
		couch. She looks up and sees his face and his bloodstained 
	shirt.
	
				SERA
		Oh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look 
		at your face. You get in a 
		fight? I thought you didn't 
		fight. Goddammit. How do you 
		feel? Wait here. Sit down.
		
	She goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the 
	medicine cabinet.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		Did you stop at the bar?
	
	She comes back into the room, armed with bottles and cotton 
	wool.
	
				SERA
		Did you say something stupid 
		to someone stupid?
	
	She goes to work on his face, dabbing an open cut with some 
	mercurochrome.
	
				BEN
		Absolutely not... ow... I was 
		defending the honor of some 
		poor wayward maiden.
		
	She thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the 
	forehead.
	
				SERA
		Why don't you go and finish 
		this in the bathroom. Take a 
		shower and put on your other 
		shirt. I'll fix breakfast and 
		then we'll go shopping and 
		get some new clothes. I think 
		this suit must be unlucky.
		
	CUT TO:
	
	95 INT. MALL - DAY
	
	Ben and Sera come out of a clothing store. Ben is wearing 
	black jeans, red socks and a white dress shirt. They go up 
	the 'up' escalator.
	
				SERA
		Very creative. Now we can get 
		you a black bow tie and you 
		can look like one of those 
			casino dealers.
	
				BEN
		OK, but remember that they 
		wear it because they have to. 
		I wear it because I want to. 
		That'll make me look 
		different. Let's get a drink.
		
	Ben somehow gets on the 'down' escalator, leaving Sera on the 
	higher level.
	
				SERA
		Ben?
	
	CUT TO:
	
	96 INT. SHOPPING MALL BAR. DAY
	
	Ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place. 
	Mothers with children, old people and a Waitress with 
	attitude. Ben tries to order but becomes angry when she 
	doesn't bring it straight away. People begin staring. At the 
	next table a dignified older man sits alone.
	
	Ben hands Sera a small package.
	
	CLOSE ANGLE
	
				BEN
		There was no time for me to 
		write a card, with you 
		breathing down my neck all 
		day., so you'll just have to 
		wing it, baby.
		
	He laughs and this induces a coughing fit. He downs his drink 
	and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she 
	should bring another.
	
				BEN
		Open it.
	
	She does so. It is a pair of onyx earrings. Black onyx set in 
	white gold.
	
				SERA
			(pleased)
		Your color.
	
				BEN
		I think you should wear one 
		at a time. One of these... and 
		one of your others. In fact, 
		I was going to buy just one, 
			but I didn't think it would 
		fly... as a gift, I mean.
		
	His new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away.
	
				SERA
		I'll wear them tonight... one 
		of them.
	
	She looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how 
	he is reacting. She smiles and Ben takes a deep swallow, 
	finishing his drink. His mood suddenly changes.
	
				BEN
		Yes... tonight. Put it on.
	
	She does so. Ben helps her, bringing his face down close to 
	hers.
	
				BEN
		You'll be able to feel it, 
		sharp and hot under your ear, 
		as one of the brothers is 
		driving your head, face down 
		into one of the penthouse 
		pillows.
		
	They are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said. 
	They sit in silence for a while. Sera is close to tears. Ben 
	gets up suddenly, puts down a couple of bills and walks away 
	from the table. When he is almost at the door Sera gets up 
	and quickly tries together up all of the packages.
	
				SERA
		Ben, wait... please wait for 
		me.
	
	ANGLE ON THE DOOR
	
	The dignified older Man stands in Ben's path and places his 
	hands on Ben's shoulders.
	
				MAN
		Maybe you should wait for 
		her, sir.
	
				BEN
		Why?
	
				MAN
		Because... you can hear in her 
		voice that she really wants 
		you to.
	
	Sera catches up and the Man lets go of Ben. Ben takes the 
		packages from Sera and the two of them step out into the 
	mall.
	
	97 INT. MALL - DAY
	
	They walk together.
	
				SERA
		What was that all about?
	
				BEN
		Can we just forget it?
	
				SERA
		I don't understand any of 
		that.
	
				BEN
		Can we just ignore it?
	
	They stop and look at each other. The PA system gives an 
	inane message.
	
				BEN
		Please!
	
				SERA
		Yes... I'll give you that.
	
				BEN
		Thank you, Sera.

		No... we already talked about

		Maybe I should follow you

		They wouldn't know.
	
	She comes on to him.

		Maybe you should ask me

		I'll be back home around

	They're under water for a long time. Ben exhales. Sera pushes

	Ben and Sera come to the surface. Ben has swallowed water and

	Ben and Sera are watching the TV next to the poll. They are 
	sitting in reclining chairs. Inn the distance a coyote howls.
	
				SERA
		Years ago, in LA, I turned a 
		trick on Sunset and Western. 
		The guy was polite and didn't 
		argue about the price. He 
		parked his car and I took him 
		to a house that I had an 
		arrangement with. A fat 
		Mexican woman was watching a 
		TV and I told him to give her 
		the twenty for the room. 
		There were three or four 
		small naked children playing 
		on the floor and we had to 
		step over them to get into 
		the room. The room had a bed 
		and a dresser. He lay on his 
		back on the bed and I put a 
		rubber on him and sucked him 
		for a while until he was hard 
		and then I eased on to him. 
		About twenty minutes later 
		there was a knock on the door 
		and it was the woman saying 
		our time was up. I felt kind 
		of guilty because he hadn't 
		come and I offered to reason 
		with the woman and get 
		another ten minutes, but he 
		said it was all right and 
		began dressing. When we were 
		ready to leave the room he 
		stopped me and... hugged me 
		and kissed me on the cheek. 
		He gave me an extra hundred 
		as a tip and went back to his 
		car. I remember being 
		relieved that I wouldn't have 
		to work again that evening.
		
				BEN
		Last spring I happened to 
		walk past a house that I had 
		once patronized. There was a 
		cool breeze blowing off the 
		ocean and through the window 
		I could see a bare leg. The 
		girl must have been taking a 
		break between customers. It 
		was a strange moment for me 
		because it reminded me of my 
		mother and despite the fact 
		that I was late for something 
		already I just stayed there, 
		loving the atmosphere of it 
		and my memory and... the 
		reason I'm telling you  this 
		epilogue is that I felt that 
		I'd come full circle.
		
				SERA
		Where was that house? The one 
		in LA, I mean.
	
				BEN
		Fifth and Mayflower. You know 
		it?
	
					SERA
		Yes. One of my friends was 
		there. I wonder if you ever 
		clipped her.
		
	They watch the TV in silence for a while. Sera holds his 
	hand.
	
				BEN
		I like it here with you.
	
				SERA
		Let's stay for a while.
	
				BEN
		OK.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	107 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Ben mixes a cocktail for himself, then one for Sera. The 
	camera follows him as he goes...  
	
	108 EXT. POOL-SIDE - DAY
	
	... to the side of the pool, where Sera is sunbathing. He 
	lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling 
	a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped 
	table. He is pretty loaded. Sera turns over and moves out of 
	his shadow.
	
				SERA
		I've missed the best sun. Why 
		did you have to pawn your 
		watch?
		
				BEN
		I didn't know I'd ever need 
		it again.
	
	Sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving 
	board. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the 
	bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive 
	into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out 
	near Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends 
	down and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses 
	back. There is no one else around the pool.
	
	The kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, 
	making him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down 
	and kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, 
	letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. 
	Ben drinks from her.
	
					BEN
		Take this off.
	
	He tries to pull her swimsuit down.
	
				SERA
		Maybe we should go inside. 
		Come on.
	
	She stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, 
	loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls 
	backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on 
	to the glass table. The table goes over and it and the 
	glasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken 
	glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass 
	goes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the 
	steaming cement.
	
				BEN
		Whoops.
	
	Sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. She 
	kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of 
	glass sticking to him. Ben stands unsteadily.
	
				BEN
		I'll go and clean up. Perhaps 
		you could take care of this. 
	
	He indicates the mess, then walks to their room. Sera begins 
	carefully picking up the broken glass. The desk clerc appears 
	with a broom and a dustpan.
	
				DESK-CLERK
			(cheerfully)
		Everybody OK?
	
				SERA
		Yes, fine. Don't worry. We'll 
		pay for the chair, and I'll 
		clean all this up, the pool 
		too.
	
				DESK-CLERK
		Don't worry.
	
	He begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully 
	ignoring Sera.
	
				SERA
		You seem prepared for 
		accidents.
	
				DESK-CLERK
			(still smiling)
		Yeah... we get a lot of screw-
		ups here.
	
	He looks directly at Sera.
	
				DESK-CLERK
		Now, you two keep you loud 
		talk and your liquor to your 
		room. Check out first thing 
		tomorrow and after that I 
		don't want to see either of 
		you here again. I don't need 
		you paying for the chair or 
		cutting your pretty hands on 
		the glass. Let's leave it at 
		that.
		
	Nodding firmly, he goes back to the mess, indicating that the 
	conversation is over.
	
				DESK-CLERK
		See ya in the morning.

	Sera comes into the room.
	
				SERA
		Ben?
	
	She sees that he is already asleep on the bed, his half-naked 
	body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue. The 
	image has an almost religious feel to it. The TV is on and a 
	sitcom is playing.
	
	Something funny catches Sera's attention. She laughs and sits 
	on the bed next to Ben.
	
				SERA (voice-over)
		I think we realized that we 
		didn't have long and accepted 
		it. My charm, for him, was 
		that I accepted him exactly 
		as he was and didn't expect 
		him to change. I think we 
		both realized that about each 
		other. Ben needed me and I 
		liked his drama. I loved him.

	Sera is cooking.
	
				SERA
		I'm in here. You probably

		right now, but I bought some 
		plain rice. I thought it 
		might be something you could 
		eat. So if you get hungry 
		later on, just let me know.
	
	Ben comes in from the kitchen and takes vodka bottles from 
	the fridge.

	115 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Ben's hands are sweating and it's difficult for him to keep 
	hold of the bottle as he drinks. He gets most of it down and 
	then he hunches over the sink and immediately vomits. He 
	takes the second bottle and tries again.

	Ben and Sera sitting opposite each other. He has a bowl of

	She has a bowl of vegetables and rice. She sits, silently for 
	a while, and then puts down her chopsticks.
	
				SERA
		You're pretty sick.
	
	Ben looks away.
	
				SERA
		What are you going to do?
	
	She folds her arms.
	
				SERA
		I want you to go see a 
		doctor.
	
	He thinks for a while and then turns to meet her gaze. They 
	look right into each other's eyes.
	
				BEN
		Sera... I'm not going to see a 
		doctor.
	
	Sera continues to look at him almost defiantly.
	
				BEN
		Maybe it's time I moved to a 
		hotel.
	
				SERA
		And do what... rot away in a 
		room?
			(becoming angry)
		We're not going to talk about 
		that. Fuck you! I will not 
		talk about that. You're 
		staying here. You are not 
		moving to a hotel.
		
				BEN
		Will you lighten up, please?
	
				SERA
			(close to tears)
			One thing... one thing... this 
		is one thing you can do for 
		me. I've given you gallons of 
		free will here! You can do 
		this for me.
		
	She leans right forward.
	
				SERA
		Let's face it. Sick as you 
		are, I'm probably the only 
		thing that's keeping you 
		alive.
	
	She stands up
	
				SERA
		I have to go to work now.
	
	Ben doesn't say anything. He just stares a hole in his bowl 
	of rice.

	Ben recklessly bets two hundred dollars at the craps 
	table... and wins. As he leans forward to collect his 
	winnings, he sees... 
	
	ANGLE:
	
	... a Blonde in a very low-cut outfit. She smiles at Ben and 
	walks around the table to pick him up. Ben puts all of his 
	winnings on one bet and wins again. This pattern repeats a 
	few times and drinks are on the house.
	
				BLONDE
		Hey... that was quite a play. 
		You in for the convention?
	
	Ben gets to the point.
	
				BEN
		I'd like to fuck you.
	
	A few people hear Ben and the Blonde is almost put off, but 
	he does have about eight thousand dollars in winnings and so 
	she leans in very close so that she can talk quietly.
		
				BLONDE
		I'm very expensive.
	
				BEN
		How much to lick your pussy?
	
	The Blonde picks up a sizeable stack of chips and looks at 
	Ben.

	Sera lets herself in, looks around and opens the bedroom 
	door. 
	
	ANGLE:
	
	In one fluid movement the naked blonde gets off the semi-
	conscious Ben, pulls her dress over her head and walks past 
	Sera. Moments later we hear the front door slam. Ben comes to 
	and looks at Sera. He is more or less unaware of what has 
	just happened. 
	
				BEN
		Hello... 
	
	ANGLE ON SERA
		
	Her eyes are wet.
	
				SERA	
		There are limits.
	
				BEN
			(remembering)
		Yes... I guess I knew that.
	
	Ben gets out of the bed. He picks up the bottle on the 
	bedside table and stands.
	
				BEN
		Perhaps I could crash on the 
		couch for a few hours... and 
		then I'll leave.
	
	He walks out of the room and closes his the door. Camera 
	moves in on Sera. She covers her face with her hands. She 
	drops her purse and slides down the wall to the floor, 
	weeping quietly.
	
				SERA (v.o)
		I heard the door slam a 
		couple of hours later and he 
		was gone.

	Three college boys with beer bottles walk the The Strip. They 
	are all wearing the same numbered jersey. Nice middle-class

	huddle before walking over to her.
	
				TALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		How much will it cost us to 
		fuck you?
	
	The other two College Boys titter. Sera starts to walk away 
	and then hesitates.
	
				SERA
		Sorry, guys, but I don't know 
		what you mean. Anyway, I 
		never date more than one guy 
		at a time.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		Come on... we got money... show 
		her the money.
	
	The other College Boy gets out his wallet and opens it to 
	show her. Sera hesitates, not somehow comfortable with the 
	situation, then goes ahead.
	
				SERA
		How much of that money did 
		you guys want to spend?
	
				TALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		How much you want? How about 
		two hundred for an hour?

		Don't your friends talk?

		Look... I'll only need one of

	Sera steps in. One boy is coming out of the bathroom wearing 
	a towel and the third is sitting in a chair smoking a 
	cigarette, which he passes to the boy in the towel. The other 
	boy is fooling around with a video camera. The atmosphere is 
	weird and Sera is suddenly alert.
	
	The Tallest College Boy hands her the money. He is very well 
	built, a football player. Sera hesitates, holding the money. 
	The Tallest College Boy closes the door and then leans 
	against it. They are all staring at her now. No one says 
	anything. Sera smiles suddenly and puts the money in her 
	purse. All business.

		OK... where's the bedroom, and 
		who's first?
	
	They all look at each other.

		Forget that. No one's doing

	The Smallest College Boy gets off the bed and comes over to 
	Sera.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		No... don't go.
	
	The Tallest Boy is still standing in front of the door and 
	things are getting strange. The Other Boy turns on the video 
	camera. Sera loses her cool.
	
				SERA
			(to the Smallest Boy)
		Maybe you'd like to fuck one 
		of your friends in the butt 
		instead.
	
	The room goes very quiet. The kid tears up. Sera tries to 
	back-pedal.

		Hey... I'm sorry... 
	
	The kid punches her hard in the stomach, knocking her to the 
	ground.

	very conspicuous and vulnerable. A big man in a white stetson 
	stands next to her. He looks at her and grins. She smiles, 
	coldly. He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar 
	chips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each 
	one against her nipples. Other people see this and stop and 
	watch. Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man

	Improvised scene. (5)

		We don't want you in here,

				SERA
		Don't worry... If you don't 
		want me in here, then I don't 
		want to be in here. Just let 
		go of my arm and I'll walk

	ear:
	
				SECURITY GUARD
		Next time it won't be so 
		fucking easy.
	
	And he pushes her towards the street and walks back into the 
	Casino. Sera is shocked. She looks around and the group of 
	people who have stopped to watch the event move away.

	Sera is throwing clothes into a suitcase.  The phone rings.

	145 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
		
	Sera comes in, closing the door behind her. The shades are 
	drawn and the room is gloomy. Ben has got back into bed. She 
	comes to the bed and sits.
	
				SERA
		Ben... I've been looking for 
		You. Have You been here since 
		You left? It smells bad in

	She clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his 
	face.
	
				BEN
		I wanted to see you... 
	
				SERA
		Oh, Ben... you look so very 
		sick... my love... you're so 
		pale.
	
	She goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face-cloth. 
	She wipes his face.
	
				BEN
		I wanted to see you... you're 
		my angel.
	
	He sits up painfully and finds a bottle, summoning up some 
	last strength to drink. His entire body shudders as he drains 
	the bottle. He puts it down and focuses on her for the first 
	time. H sees her damaged face, touches her face, looks at her 
	questioningly.  
	
				SERA
		Something went wrong... I'm 
		OK.
	
	Ben begins to cry and that sets her off.
	
				BEN
		I'm sorry I put us asunder.
	
	She shakes her head, unable to speak for the moment. She gets 
	into bed with him, kissing his face. She caresses his whole 
	body, which is shaking, possessed by an uncontrollable fever.
	
				BEN
		See how hard You make me 
		angel. 
	
	She excites him with her hand, kissing his face gently. When 
	he is about to come, she straddles him and brings him inside. 
	As he comes, he opens his eyes wide and looks at her.
		
				BEN
		You know I love you... yeah? 
	
	
	
				SERA
			(she comes)
		Yes.
	
	SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
	
	FADE IN:
	
	Sera is sleeping. A sudden gasp wakes her. Ben is having a 
	spasm. Suddenly his body relaxes. He turns his head, opens 
	his eyes wide and looks straight at her.
	
	
	
				BEN
		Oh... I'm so sorry... 
	
	
	He smiles and turns his head away. He is very still.
	
				SERA
		Ben... Ben... Ben?
	
	CUT TO:
	
	146 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the darkened room we can just make out Sera sitting on the 
	bed, looking at the still form of Ben.
	
	CUT TO:
	 
	147 EXT. STREET NEAR MOTEL -  DAWN
	
	Sera walking. A paramedic van goes past with its lights 
	flashing. The soundtrack is empty - silent. We slowly fade in 
	theme music and titles start to roll.

	TITLE ON BLACK; '10 P.M. - LOS ANGELES'
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	1 INT. SMART BAR IN BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
	
		
	It is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of LA go 
	to pick up - or be picked up. Lesser-known actors, agents 
	and executives of all ages.
	
	Into this bar comes Ben.
	
	Ben is in his thirties. He is wearing an Armani suit 
	that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. He hasn't 
	shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has 
	any of the actors in the bar). He is a good-looking man 
	but is clearly in trouble of some kind. Although still 
	in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the 
	following scene that he is much the worse for wear with 
	drink. He looks around the room until he sees someone he
	recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples
	are seated. The men are young execs, the girls, both blonde 
	and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. 
	The camera follows Ben over to the table. One of the execs
	looks up as Ben gets close. He recognizes him but delays 
	his recognition until the last moment in the hope that Ben 
	is not looking at him.
	 
				BEN
		Peter
		
				PETER
		Ben... how are you, man?
	
	They shake hands. Ben is not invited to take a seat and 
	Peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him 
	to the table.
	
	Ben Sanderson, Marc Nussbaum, Sheila, Debbie.
	
	
				MARC
		Nice to meet you. I think I 	
		spoke to you on the phone a 	
		couple of years ago. Weren't 	
		you both at MGM with Laddie?
	
				BEN
		That's right. Are you still
		at ICM?
	
				MARC
		No, I'm at Tri-Star now.
	
				BEN
		That's great. Say hello to 	
		Mike for me. That's a 	
		beautiful dress, Debbie, and 	
		those are fabulous earrings, 	
		Sheila.
	
	There is an awkward silence. Ben does not make a move and 
	is not invited to join them. The girls smile.
	 
				MARC
		I gotta tell you, I'm a big 	
		fan of your writing. I loved 	
		Bay of Pigs.
	
				BEN
		Thanks a lot. I didn't 	
		actually write it, I just got 
		the credit. I was fired.
			(to Peter)
		Can I talk to you for a 	
		moment?
	
	Peter gets up and he and Ben walk to the door together. 
	Peter speaks very quietly.
	
				PETER
		Listen, Ben, I can't help you 
		any more. Do you understand?
	
				BEN
			This is the last time. 	
		Promise. I just need some 	
		cash tonight. I lost my 	
		credit cards. The money'll be 
		on your desk first thing 	
		tomorrow morning, Scout's 	
		honor. How's the new one 	
		coming along? I here you got 	
		Richard Gere.
	
	The two men look at each other for a while. Peter's 
	friends are looking at them, as are other people in 
	the room. Peter takes out his wallet and extracts some 
	notes.
	
				PETER
		This is all I have in cash. 	
		Please don't drink it here.
	
				BEN
		Yes, that's fine. I'll	
		messenger it over to you 	
		tomorrow.
	
				PETER
		I don't want it. Ben... I
		think it would be best if you 
		didn't contact me again.
	
	And he turns and walks away, back to his table.

	TITLE ON BLACK; 'LAS VEGAS - 1.20 A.M.'
	
	FADE UP ON:
	
	2 EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
	
	Las Vegas. A blaze of color in the middle of a desert.
	
	Credit sequence begins.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	3 INT. LOBBY OF EXPENSIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	A mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense 
	of activity and superficial excitement. Music wafts 
	across the soundtrack, almost drowned by the dense 
	texture of thousands of slot machines, creating an 
	insane New Age symphony.
	
	Credit sequence ends.
		
	Into the lobby from the street comes Sera.
	
	It's hard to tell how old Sera is - somewhere between 
	twenty-five and thirty-five. She is a beautiful American 
	girl. Her face has the freshness of a model in a Sears 
	catalogue. She is dressed simply in a short black skirt 
	and matching jacket. High heels complete the picture. 
	Heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and it's 
	clear they find her very sexy. She acknowledges their 
	glance with a half-smile and steps into the elevator. 
	She could be a secretary, or a PA to one of the many 
	execs here in Las Vegas at a convention. The body language 
	is a bit different, though.
	
	4 INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE OF HOTEL - NIGHT
	
	A view of night-time Las Vegas through a window. Traffic up 
	and down The Strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
	We hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls 
	focus and we see reflected in the glass...
	
	...a group of people.
	
	On the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and 
	sandwiches. The TV is on at a sports channel and two 
	boxers pound the shit out of each other.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	5 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Sera looks at herself in the gold-tinted mirror in 
	the elevator. She takes out a lipstick and freshens 
	her lips. Some people get out and the elevator climbs 
	higher. We see from the indicator that she has punched 
	the Penthouse button. Camera moves in tighter and we 
	see that she is nervous but concealing it well. The 
	elevator stops, the doors open and she steps right 
	into the Penthouse.
	
	6 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
	
	A bottle of Scotch is almost empty. The man talking is Yuri. 
	He is Russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, 
	a big man wearing a blue silk suit. His thick black hair 
	is greased and combed back. He wears a lot of jewelry, 
	all gold. Rings, a bracelet and a Rolex. Two men in 
	business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late 
	thirties listen to him.
	
				YURI
		...but please, my friends, 	
		call me Yuri. It is my 	
		American name... I picked it 	
		myself.
	
	The three people laugh. There is a hint of contempt in 
	the way that they speak to Yuri.
	
				FIRST BUSINESSMAN
		Where are you from, Yuri? I 	
		mean, you sure don't talk 	
		like you're from this neck of 
		the woods. 
	
	Yuri smiles at them.
	
				YURI
			(silky voice)
		No... you are right, my 	
		friend. How very observant 	
		you are. I am from Latvia.
		
				WEIRD WOMAN
		Tough place.
	
				YURI
		Yes, I hear this too. But I 	
		am not a tough man. I am a 	
		simple man who is here to 	
		learn from my new American 	
		friends.
	
	The door opens and Sera comes in. Everybody stares at her.
	
				WEIRD WOMAN
			(turned on)
		Is this your friend, Yuri?
		
				YURI
		Ah, yes... Sera.
	
	The second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from 
	his inside pocket.
	
				YURI(cont'd)
		Sera is my gift to you, my 	
		friends from New York City. 	
		You may do with her as you 	
		wish in this beautiful room, 	
		which is also my gift for the 
		night to my friends. You will 
		find her a very willing girl, 
		for all of you...just as we 	
		arranged.
	
	Yuri smiles again as the Second Businessman hands him the 
	envelope. The rest of them just stare at Sera, aroused by the 
	idea of her.
		
			SECOND BUSINESSMAN
		Of course, Yuri. I think 	
		you'll find this just as we 	
		discussed.
		
	Yuri gets up.
	
				YURI
		So, my friends... I have other 
		business to attend. Enjoy.
		
		
	He heads for the door, passing Sera. She holds out his arm as 
	he passes.
	
				SERA
			(whispering)
		Yuri... please! Can I talk to 	
		you for a moment.
		
		
	Still smiling, he takes Sera's arm and leads her into the 
	bedroom.
	
	
				YURI
		My friends... excuse me for 	
		just one moment. 
		
		
	7 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

	Mirrors reflect mirrors.
	
				SERA
		I don't want this. Yuri, 	
		please. I really don't want 	
		this. You know I don't like 	
		to do groups.
	
				YURI
			(playful)
		I want this, Sera. I need 	
		this!   
		
					SERA
		Please, Yuri.
		
		
		
	He holds put his arms. Sera goes to him. He hugs her with one 
	arm. He pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed.
	
				YURI
			(seductive)
		These are pretty.
	
	Sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal 
	her buttocks. He strokes her there gently with his other 
	hand. We see that there are two fine scars there. He speaks 
	gently, like a father to a daughter.
	
				YURI(cont'd)
		Is this how you would repay 	
		me for coming all this way to 
		find you again? Driving 	
		through the desert to protect 
		my little Sera.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	FLASHBACK-SILENT-GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE
	
	8 INT. ROOM - NIGHT
	Yuri and Sera - different time, different place. Sera looking 
	frightened, backing away from Yuri, who pulls a switchblade 
	from his jacket and opens it.
	
	
	CUT BACK TO:
	
	9 INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
	Yuri enters from the bedroom. The weird woman is doing a line 
	of coke.
	
				YURI
			(cheerful)
		Sera wanted me to ask if she 	
		might undress at once for 	
		you. She has a very beautiful 
		undergarment witch she would 	
		like you to see.
	
	ANGLE ON BEDROOM DOOR
	
	Sera comes into the room. She smiles and begins unbuttoning 
	her jacket.
	
	She takes it off and drops it on the floor, and then unzips 
	her skirt and steps out of it. Sera is now in control and 
	playing the room. In the background. Yuri leaves the room.
	
				WEIRD WOMAN
			(strange voice)
		Come here.
	
	Sera walks over and something strange takes place between 
	them.
			
	CUT TO:
		
	10 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - MORNING
	
	The bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is 
	a very bright sunny day outside. The bartender reads the Los 
	Angeles Times. The bar surface is red vinyl. There are five 
	customers, all single men. One of them is Ben and he is 
	sitting at the bar watching TV. A game show is in progress 
	and the TV sound is loud. Ben finishes his drink and grimaces 
	before indicating to the barman that he'd like a repeat. 
	Barman pours him a whiskey - Cranberry - and the camera moves 
	in closer to Ben, ending in a close-up. Ben takes a big hit 
	from the drink and concentrates on the TV. We hear from the 
	TV sound that it is a word game with a big prize. Ben smiles 
	to himself.
	
	BEN'S POV OF TV
	
	The talk show hostess, an American TV beauty, is showing the 
	audience the prizes available in today's game show.
	
	ANGLE ON BEN
	
	As he finishes that drink and asks for another. The camera 
	moves in close on his eyes. 
	
	BEN'S POV OF TV
	
	She turns from the prizes and looks straight into the TV 
	camera, which starts zooming into her. At first, what she is 
	saying makes complete sense, but then things change...
	
				HOSTESS
			(smoky, sexy voice)
		Just look at this studio, 	
		Ben, filled with glamorous 	
		merchandise, including an 	
		extra special prize chosen 	
		just for You! A big, bad, BMW 
		motorcycle, complete with 	
		saddle bags stuffed with 	
		thousands of US dollars.
	
	"There are oohs" from the audience.
	
	
				HOSTESS
		So, Ben,
			(tosses her hair)
		Let's find a bar, get drunk 	
		and go for a ride.
	
	The studio lights dim.
	
				HOSTESS
		Then we can get a suite 	
		somewhere and order up a case 
		of champagne while we fuck 	
		ourselves silly.
	
	Close-up on males in the audience doing the grunt.
	
				HOSTESS
		This is it, just for You,
		Ben. 
	
	She unbuttons her top, licks her fingers and makes her 
	nipples hard.
	
				HOSTESS
		Because You've been so 
		patient, and because I want 
		to fuck you, take care of 
		You, and because there's 
		nothing else in the world 
		worth doing.
	
	Section of the audience clapping - some women dabbing their 
	eyes.
	
				HOSTESS
		Tell you what, Ben, let's go 
		to Las Vegas. The bars stay 
		open twenty four hours night 
		and day. Just you, just me, 
		Ben, think about it, all 
		right? 
	
	ANGLE ON BEN
	
	Lost in his fantasy
	
				BEN
		I'll think about it.
	
	He looks back at the screen, but the show has returned to 
	what is known as "normal". He finishes his drink and then an 
	attack of nausea hit him. He takes a deep breath and rolls 
	his neck and his head. The barman puts down a fresh drink. 
	Ben looks at his own hands...which are steady.
	
				BARMAN
		You should go on that show.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	11 INT. SMART BUSINESS SPACE - MORNING
	
	Ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear, a cup 
	of black coffee on the desk. The walls are covered with 
		framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed 
	with scripts. He nods from time to time and sometimes says 
	'yes' or 'OK', but it becomes clear that there is no one on 
	the other end. He drinks from the coffee cup. A woman comes 
	up to his desk, a business colleague. She puts a wad of 
	messages down on the desk.
	
				BEN
		Yeah, but what's the back end 
		like? By the time we're 
		through with P and A, the 
		above-the line is going to 
		take it to about fifteen and 
		with something like this... I 
		don't know if Disney will go 
		for it... can I call you back 
		on this? OK... chow for now.
			(to the woman)
		Good morning.
	
	
				WOMAN
			(cautious)
		Ben... Mr. Simpson was looking 
		for you. I said that you had 
		a doctor's appointment. He 
		said for you to go in as soon 
		as... are you OK?
	
				BEN
			(pulling himself together)
		I'm fantastic, but I gotta go 
		out now... very important 
		meeting, could make a coupla 
		million for the company.
	
	Ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a 
	few steps. It is clear that she likes Ben, but when his face 
	gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and 
	she turns away. Ben stops dancing and smiles sadly.
	
				WOMAN
			(tender)
		Ben?
	
				BEN
		What?
	
				WOMAN
		You should go now.
	
	She leaves the room and Ben goes through some routine at the 
	desk. He opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his 
	whole arm, looking for something at the very back. He pulls 
	out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the 
		contents into his coffee cup. With cup in hand he leaves the 
	room.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	12 INT. SMART OFFICE - DAY
	
	Ben is sitting opposite his boss, Mr. Simpson, who is very 
	upset. He hands Ben an envelope. Ben opens it and pulls out a 
	check. He looks at the amount.
	
				BEN
			(genuinely moved) 
		This is to generous Peter.
	
				SIMPSON
			(close to tears)
		Well... we liked having you 
		around, Ben, but you know how 
		it is.
	
				BEN
			(ashamed)
		Sure thing... and I'm sorry.
	
	Ben takes a swig from his coffee cup.
	
				SIMPSON
			(trying to cheer things along)
		Well... what are you going to 
		do now?
	
				BEN
		I thought I might move out to 
		Las Vegas.
	
	Simpson looks puzzled.
	
				BEN
		The bars never close.

	13 INT. BEN'S BMW  DAY
	
	Ben drives though Beverly Hills. He pours the content of a 
	small bottle of vodka into an empty Coke can, puts the empty 
	bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can.
	
	He slips a tape into the player and we hear "Lonely 
	Teardrops", by Michael McDonald, one of Ben's favorite songs. 
	At a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and 
	Ben takes a pull from the Coke can and smiles, mouths the 
	word "hot". The cop nods back at him, the light changes and 
	they both pull away.
		
	CUT TO:
	
	14 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET  DAY
	
	Ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks. Camera follows 
	him as he walks down the street. He looks at... 
	
	BEN'S POV
	
	A girl walking ahead of him in the same direction. She is 
	walking her dog. She is attractive from behind. We hear Ben's 
	thoughts.
	
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		Beautiful, no just the shape 
		which is nice, but the whole 
		walk, the feeling, the 
		movement. This girl is 
		pleased with herself. Maybe 
		this is the only art I can 
		appreciate... I don't know if 
		this is good or bad, but 
		right now she is really 
		beautiful. When I was a boy 
		it would have been really 
		important that she have a 
		pretty face, to go with this 
		body, I mean. I still would 
		like to see her face, but her 
		beauty is no dependent on her 
		face.
	
	The dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she 
	bends down to pull at its collar. 
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		I wonder what kind of panties 
		she's wearing. Shit, that's 
		too specific, but... on the 
		other hand, you can never be 
		too specific... but then, the 
		infinitesimal must be, by 
		definition, as infinite as 
		the infinite.
	
	Suddenly the girl stops. Ben catches up with her and cannot 
	resist looking into her face.
	
				BEN
			(voice-over)
		God, she's so young.
		
	The girl sees Ben and smiles an innocent smile,
	
				GIRL
		Hi!
	
				BEN
		Hi...

	15 EXT. BEN'S HOUSE IN SANT MONICA - DAY
	
	Ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag. A 
	young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat-up 
	bike. Ben greets him.
	
				BEN
		Hey, Brad... how's it going?
	
				BRAD
		Hey Ben. There were a couple 
		of guys looking for you.
	
				BEN
		What did they look like?
	
				BRAD
		Suits. I didn't tell them 
		anything. You know anything 
		about gears?
	
	Ben takes a look. The gear mechanism is all bent out of 
	shape. He bends down to have a look. It is clear from the way 
	he deals with this mechanical problem that he's good with his 
	hands. He doesn't try to force anything but he moves the 
	chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem.
	
				BEN
		How'd this happen? 
	
				BRAD
		I was going real fast down on 
		the beach and something 
		slipped and everything got 
		jammed up.
	
				BEN
		The news is not good, kid. 
		This bit here... see 
		there... it's broken. You need 
		a new  one.
	
				BRAD
			(upset)
			How much, do you think?
	
				BEN
		I don't know. I'll find out 
		though.
	
	Ben gets up, picks up his bottles and heads for his house. He 
	looks back and Brad is sitting still by the bike, looking 
	totally dejected. This really seems to upset Ben.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	16 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
	
	Ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background. 
	The house is austere, only the minimum of furnishing. He 
	pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp, then tops up 
	the glass. He turns on the stereo, selects a record - Miles 
	Davis, Kind of Blue - and puts it on the turntable. He turns 
	on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape. He 
	puts the machine into the record mode. He kneels down next to 
	the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the 
	second track without any problem. The music starts and 
	continues through the next sequence. 
	
	17 INT. SHOVER - DAY
	
	Ben is in the shower with the glass in his hand.
	
	18 INT. BATHROOM - DAY
	
	Ben shaving with the glass in his hand. He does the area 
	around his mouth first so that he can drink while he does the 
	rest.
	
	19 INT. LIVING SPACE - DAY
	
	Showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit, Ben looks 
	handsome and normal. He selects another record and again sets 
	up the cassette machine to record. He turns the stereo up 
	full and dances by himself while watching MTV silent. He 
	tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance. 
	In slow motion we see him fall. Ben lies still on the floor. 
	He smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a 
	while...

	20 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM. LAS VEGAS - DAY
	
	Sera wakes up in bed next to Yuri. (The camera is high above 
	the bed looking down.) She is completely drenched in sweat. A 
	thin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and 
		falls across their bodies. Other than that, the room is in 
	darkness. To get out of bed she would have to climb over him. 
	She lies still. Yuri speaks without opening his eyes... 
	
				YURI
		I missed you, Sera. You have 
		been lonely?
	
	Sera blinks and turns her head towards him.
	
				SERA
		I'm older now, Yuri.
	
	He puts his hand between her legs, over the sheets and grasps 
	her there.
	
				YURI
		You have been lonely?
	
				SERA
			(tensing a little)
		I've been all right.
	
				YURI

	He climbs on to her and mounts her. Familiarity.
	
				YURI
		You have been lonely?
	
				SERA
			(flat voice)
		I am lonely, Yuri.
	
	He begins thrusting into her.
	
				YURI
		Yes... so am I.
	
	Camera move slowly into a tight portrait of Sear.

		I had a new dress... we were

	Sera is sitting on a sofa talking to an unseen person. 
		(Although it is no entirely clear when this is taking place, 
	the sense of it is that we are in present, i.e. all the 
	events in the film are in the past tense.)
	
				SERA
		... Mom was with Helen, and 
		Dad looked around first to 
		see if she was watching and 
		then he scraped it all off 
		and threw it on the grass and 
		then he kissed me and hugged 
		me and told me it was all 
		right... 
		
	22 INT. SERA'S KITCHEN. LATER THAT DAY
	
	Yuri is tucking into a hearty breakfast. Sera plays with her 
	food.
	
				YURI
			(planning his day)
		This is such a small 
		apartment, Sera. I cannot 
		stay here. We will find a big 
		apartment. You know how much 
		money I can bring you. I 
		belong in... 
			(laughs)
		... wealth and luxury.
	
	He suddenly looks up from his food and smiles at her.
	
				YURI
		Why did you run away from me 
		in Los Angeles?
	
	Sera says nothing.
	
				YURI
		Because you are sly. Mmm? You 
		knew all along that there was 
		more money in Las Vegas. 
		Didn't you?
	
	Sera nervously plays with her food.
	
				YURI
		You have nothing to fear from 
		me. You know why? Because we 
		belong together, Sera. Don't 
		we?
	
	Sera forces a smile.
	
				SERA
				(quietly)
		Yes.

	CUT BACK TO:
	
	24 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
	
				YURI
		I'm pleased with you, 
		Sera... how you have moved up 
		in the world. I showed you a 
		glamorous world when I took 
		you off the streets... 
			(shaking his head)
		and how you repay me.
	
				SERA 
		Where have you been staying?
	
				YURI
		With an old friend.
	
	He drops his fork.
	
				YURI
		But that is none of your 
		affair. You will call this 
		morning and book me into a 
		hotel suite where I will make 
		new contacts for us.
		
	The mood has changed and Sera does her best to move out of 
	these dangerous waters.
	
				SERA
		You'll need some money, then.
	
	Yuri nods. Sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds 
	money.
	
				YURI
			(becoming angry)
		It is, after all, Sera, my 
		money.
	
				SERA
				(calmly)
		Yes, of course. How much do 
		you need?
	
				YURI
			(shaking his head)
		All of it. I need to buy many 
		things... all of it!
	
	Yuri is very angry and as Sera hands him the money, he hits 
	her, hard, knocking her back into the refrigerator. His ring 
	cuts her cheek.
				YURI
			(shouting)
		Don't look at me like that.
	
	And then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her. 
	He takes her face in his hands to look at the cut.
	
				YURI
		It's not so bad. It is 
		nothing.
			(whispers)
		I need money, Sera. I need it 
		fast. You must go on the 
		street tonight. For me.
		
	He sits down with shaking hands. He suddenly seems more 
	vulnerable than she is. He goes to the window and looks out, 
	left and then right, as if he expects to see something.
	
				YURI
		I need money fast, Sera. I 
		want you back on the street. 
		Tonight.
		
	FADE OUT:
	
	FADE IN SLOWLY - SOUND FIRST:
	
	25 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Ben opens his eyes. The only light comes from the TV. The 
	miles Davis record has got caught on a scratch and is 
	repeating the sane phrase over and over again. He looks at 
	his gold Rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his 
	finger.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	26 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA - NIGHT
	
	Ben is sitting at the bar. He drinks a large glass of 
	something very quickly and then immediately orders another.
	
	He drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes 
	it and then orders another. He looks around the bar and sees 
	a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. 
	She looks and sees Ben, and he smiles at her. She smiles 
	right back. Ben talks across the bar. 
	
				BEN
			(charming)
		Good evening.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
			(pleased)
		Hi.
	
				BEN
		I'm Benjamin...Ben.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		I'm Teri.
	
	Ben walks over to where she is. She is pleased that this 
	good-looking man has come over to make a play. She makes a 
	noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.
	
				BEN
		I'll get you another 
		one... and me too. Mind if I 
		join you?
	
	She watches him walk to the bar. He gets the drink and walks 
	back to her. He sets the drinks down on the table and sits 
	down. As he does so, his face gets close to hers and she 
	smells the booze on him.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		Wow... been drinking all day?
	
				BEN
		But of course.
	
	She looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. She 
	is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this 
	much is clear to Ben.
	
				BEN
		Why don't we finish these and 
		go to my apartment on the 
		beach?
	
	She doesn't respond.
	
				BEN
		We can watch a movie and I'll 
		mix you up a gooey blender 
		drink.
		
	Ben winces at his own words. He shakes his head.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		I have to get up pretty early 
		tomorrow. I'll just finish 
		this and go. Thanks anyway.
		
	They drink in silence for a while. Ben takes a deep breath.0
	
				BEN
			(pathetic)
		I really wish that you'd come 
		home with me. You're so cute 
		and I'm really good in 
		bed... believe me... you smell 
		good too... 
	
	He stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.
	
				BEN
		No, OK.
	
	Ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the 
	bar. It's a strange thing with drunks like Ben... when they're 
	up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all 
	falls apart. She starts to speak but then doesn't. A look of 
	great sadness comes over her.
	 
				PRETTY WOMAN
		I have to go now. Thanks 
		anyway.
	
	She stands to go.
	
				PRETTY WOMAN
		Maybe you shouldn't drink so 
		much.
	
	She walks to the door and Ben turns to the bar, watched by he 
	Barman, who is a little concerned.
	
				BEN
			(to himself)
		Maybe I shouldn't breathe so 
		much, Teri. Ha... ha.
	
				BARMAN
			(sever voice)
		Time to go, buddy... We're 
		closing up.
	
	Ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much 
	that he cannot extract any bills. He is very embarrassed and 
	tries again, but to no avail.
		
				BEN
		Would you... ?
	
	The barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the 
	wallet and takes some money.

	28 INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
	
	Ben comes into the club and sits down next to the stage, 
	where a dancer is doing her thing accompanied by a live blue 
	trio. A swimsuited waitress comes to the table.
	
	WAITRESS
	There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign 
	when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
	
				BEN
		Yes, I heard, and it's not a 
		problem.
	
				WAITRESS
		What do you want?
	
				BEN
		What are my choices?
	
				WAITRESS
		Everything's ten dollars, and 
		there's no alcohol.
	
				BEN
		No alcohol?
	
				WAITRESS
		No alcohol. You gotta get 
		something else. Everything's 
		ten dollars. What do you 
		want?
	
				BEN
		What do you think I should 
		get?
	
				WAITRESS
		Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
	
					BEN
		... Noooo.
	
				WAITRESS
		Orange soda?
	
				BEN
		No.
	
				WAITRESS
		Coffee?
	
				BEN
		No.
	
				WAITRESS
		Sparkling apple cider?
	
				BEN
		No.
	
				WAITRESS
		Water?
	
				BEN
		Water?
	
				WAITRESS
		One drink minimum per show. 
		Everything's ten dollars. 
		Now... tell me what you want 
		or I'll eighty-six you.
	
				BEN
			(decides)
		Water.	
	
	She writes down W.A.T.E.R. and walks away. Ben calls her 
	back.
	
				BEN
		Just how much would it cost 
		for you to eighty-six me?
	
	ANGLE ON THE STAGE
	
	A tough black girl dances in a world of her own, impervious 
	to the men who stare at her. The trio grinds out a dirty 
	blues. A man opposite Ben places a dollar bill on the stage 
	and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between 
	her legs an winks. The Waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and 
	a bottle of water in front of Ben but refuses to look at him.
	
				WAITRESS
			(hostile)
		Three-fifty.
	
	Ben puts down a hundred on to her tray.
	
				BEN
			(polite)
		Could I have fives please? 
		Keep one for yourself.
	
	This throws the Waitress for a loop.

	29 INT. BATHROOM OF STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
	
	Ben drinks all of a fifth of bourbon. Other guys come and go,

	30 INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
	
	Ben sits next to another man watching the show. On stage a 
	tall blonde dances with her own reflection in a mirror. Ben 
	turns to his neighbor.
	
				BEN
		To me nothing is more

		relationship between the 
		reflection of a woman and the 
		woman who has created it.

			(completely uninterested)
		No shit!

	Ben drives in his car.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	31 EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - LATER THAT NIGHT
	
	Ben is cruising in his car, listening to 'Lonely Teardrops' 
	again. He's looking for a prostitute. He sees a girl, but 
	when he slows down she ducks into a doorway. 
	
	He looks in his rear-view mirror and sees a cop car coming up 
	fast. Ben panics for a second. There is a bottle between his 
	legs. The cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a 
	while, but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off, 
	doing a U-turn.
		
	Ben continues and then sees an Hispanic girl and stops. He 
	winds down the window. He is by now almost incoherent.
	
				BEN
		Good evening.
	
	32 EXT. KERBSIDE - NIGHT
	
	The girl looks up and down the street and then walks over to 
	the car and bends down to the window.
	
				HISPANIC GIRL
		You wanna date? You wanna 
		date me?
	
	The girl's eyes shift constantly from Ben to the street and 
	then back again.
	
				BEN
			(cut to the chase)
		I'll give you a hundred 
		dollars for a straight forty-
		five minutes. You get the 
		room.
		
	Ben shows her the money. 
	
				HISPANIC GIRL
			(trying to take him)
		The room is twenty. You pay 
		for it.
	
	Ben laughs.
	
				BEN
		OK... but only because I think 
		that the concept of surrender 
		fits in with the big picture 
		right now. How about over 
		there?
	
	He gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the 
	street. She sets off and he gets out of the car. As he does, 
	a wave of nausea hits him. He shakes his head violently and 
	then lurches across the street, causing two cars to hit their 
	brakes. The camera follows him into the dark parking lot of 
	the motel, where the Hispanic girl is waiting.
	
				BEN
			(slurring badly)
		I canremember... if 
		mywifeleffme... or Illeff 
		her... bufuckittanyway... 
	
	The girl laughs at Ben and says something in Spanish.
	
	Slowly the picture gets darker, until all that can be seen is 
	the headlights from the passing cars on Sunset... and then... 
	
	33 INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAWN
	
	Ben wakes up on the kitchen floor. The fridge door is open 
	and its light is what lights Ben. Inside the fridge are one 
	green pepper and four bottles of vodka. Without too much 
	effort Ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still 
	there, as are his car keys. He closes the fridge door and in 
	the green light from the window he lies still. The first 
	birds start singing. (the birdsong continues through the 
	following sequence, which does not have sync sound.)

				BANK GIRL
		OK... four thousand, six 
		hundred dollars... one moment,

	She looks at her computer read-out.
	
				BANK GIRL
		That'll leave five dollars in

				BEN
			(surprised)
		You couldn't cash it just

			(puzzled)
		I'm sorry, sir. Is there a

	Ben picks up a pen and tries to sign, but his hands are 
	shaking so much that he cannot do it.
	
				BEN
			(embarrassed)
		Well... to tell you the truth, 
		I'm a little shaky right now. 
		I just had a brain

	41 INT. BEN'S BAR. LA. - MORNING
	
	Ben seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him. The 
	Barman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes 
	some bills, shaking his head in disapproval. The TV is on, 
	some game show as before, and Ben watches carefully, looking 
	for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 
	'normal' fashion. The only difference is that the hostess is 
	played by the girl in the bank. Ben grabs the Barman's 
	attention.
	
				BEN
		I think, when I'm done with 
		this, I'll have gin and 
		tonic... Bombay gin and tonic.
		
	The Barman loses it
	
				BARMAN
			(angry)
		You should be having coffee. 
		Do you know what time it is? 
		You're a young man.
			(calmer)
		It's none of my business, but 
		if you could see what I see, 
		you wouldn't do this to 
		yourself.
	
	Ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice. In his mind, 
	cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out. He holds the 
	emotion back, and looks down at the bar.
	
				BEN
		I understand what you're 
		saying... I appreciate your 
		concern. Its not my intention 
		to make you uncomfortable. 
		Please... serve me today and I 
		will never come in here 
		again.
			(cheerful)
		If I do, you can eighty-six 
		me.
	
				BARMAN
		Sure, sure, I can eighty-six 
		you now if I want to. Stop 
		fucking with me. I don't give 
		a fuck what you do.
	
	He picks up a bottle of gin, fills a glass, slams it on the 
	counter in front of Ben and knocks twice with his knuckles on 
	the bar.

	On the house, son.

	Ben looks at the TV for a sign. None is forthcoming.

	Ben waiting in line again. The same Bank girl is there and 
	she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely 
	cheerful way that the game-show Hostess dealt with her prize-
	winners. She notices Ben waiting and an irritated look 
	flashes over across her face. Ben studies her. She is pretty 
	in an ordinary kind of way. We hear Ben's thoughts as voice-
	over (or maybe he says them out loud to himself).
	
				BEN
			(voice over)
		Are you desirable? Are you

		drank bourbon with me, it

		would help.
	
	Close-up on the Bank Girl as she does her thing, efficiently 
	counting money, smiling, perfect teeth framed by a Cupid

	lingerie can just be made out.
	
				BEN
		If you drank bourbon with me 
		naked... if you smelled of 
		bourbon as you fucked me, it 
		would help... it would 
		increase my esteem for you. 
		If you poured bourbon on to 
		your naked body and said to 
		me... drink this... 
		
	Camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a 
	customer about the weather.
	
				BEN
		... if you spread your legs 
		and had bourbon dripping from 
		your breasts and you vagina 
		and said drink here... then I 
		could fall in love with you, 
		because then I would have a 
		purpose, to clean you up, and 
		that would prove that I'm 
		worth something. Id lick you 
		clean so you could go away 
		and fuck someone else.
		
					BANK GIRL
		Next!
	
	Ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie. He smiles and 
	comes to the counter, completely in control of himself.
	
				BEN
		I'm back, I've got my

	He flips the check over, makes sure she is watching and signs 
	with a flourish.

		There... Steady as a fucking

		Wanna have dinner with me?
	
	She counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it

	Ben driving. He sees Sera and follows her, then drives up on 
	the sidewalk. She sees him.
	
				BEN
		Hello!
	
				SERA 
		Hello.
	
				BEN
		Are you working?
	
				SERA
			(tough)
		Working? What do you mean, 
		working? I'm walking.
	
	And she walks a few steps to prove it, stopping on the 
	passenger side of his car. They pause for a moment and Ben is 
	confused. He is quite taken with her beauty, but this is not 
	going according to plan. He reaches into the car quickly and 
	picks an open can of bee, draining it before tossing the 
	empty back on to the rear seat.
	
				SERA
		Isn't it illegal to drink and 
		drive?
	
				BEN
			(laughs)
		That's funny.
			(seriously)
		I wonder if you'll take two 
		hundred and fifty dollars to 
		fuck me?
		
	Sera doesn't say anything.
	
				BEN
		That is, if you'll come to my 
		room for an hour, I will give 
		you five hundred dollars.
	
				SERA
		Maybe you shouldn't stand in 
		the road like that. You're 
		pretty drunk.
	
	He bites his lips as he waits for her to respond.
	
				SERA
			(softer)
		You're pretty drunk.
	
				BEN
			(factual)
		Not really. My room's not 
		far. The Whole Year Inn. You 
		can drive with me if you 
		want... 
		
	She makes no response.
	
				BEN
		... or we can walk... or I'll 
		give you cab fare.
		
	Takes out his money.
	
				BEN
		Whatever you want.
	
	She touches the door handle.
	
				SERA
		Why don't you give me the 
		money when I'm in the car, 
		and I'll drive you.
		
	It takes a moment or two to register that she is saying yes. 
	He comes around the car to open the door for her.
	
				BEN
		I'm Ben.
	
	
	
	They shake hands.
	
				SERA
			I'm Sera.
	
	She gets in. Ben gets in.

	Ben hands her the money.
	
				BEN
		Sarah - with an H?

		No - S.E.R.A.
	
	They grin at each other.
	
				SERA
		You wanna start the engine?
	
	They drive off.
	
	60 EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	
	They sit in the car for a while before speaking.
	
				SERA
		I'm sort of curious... if 
		you're willing to pay me two-
		fifty... not that I mind... I 
		mean, I'm OK with that - why 
		aren't you staying in a 
		hotel?
		
				BEN
		We can go to one if you'd 
		prefer.
	
				SERA
		No, this is fine.  I was just 
		wondering.
	
	Ben switches off the engine but makes no move to get out of 
	the car.
	
				BEN
		Well... I'm here because I'm a 
		drunk who tends to pass out 
		at odd hours for 
		unpredictable stretches. I'm 
		going to a hotel soon. A room 
		with a balcony to pass out 
		on... or off.
		
		He falls silent.
	
				SERA
		Umm. We can stay in the car 
		for an hour if you want. But 
		I really have to go then. 
		It's your time. 
		
				BEN
		Right, I'll get your door. I 
		tend to fade in and out 
		lately.
		
				SERA
		I guess I do too.
	
				BEN
		You what?
	
				SERA
		I sometimes fade out.
	
				BEN
		Oh... well, maybe we better 
		synchronize our spells... or 
		stagger them.
		
				SERA
			(gently)
		You were going to get my 
		door.
		
	He gets out and she waits for him to open the door. She gets 
	out and he offers her his arm. She takes it and they walk 
	into the motel.

				SERA
			(amused)
		What this room needs... is 
		more booze.
	
	SERA'S POV
	
	There are bottles everywhere. Ben has gone to a lot of troble 
	to lay them out in a pleasing way. 
	
				BEN
		Do you think so?
	
		She turns and looks at him, appraising him. Suddenly she's 
	all business, in control, and Ben likes it.
	
				SERA
		Mind if I use the bathroom?
	
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	She goes into the bathroom.
	
				BEN
		Want a drink? I'm having one.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		A shot of tequila, if you can 
		spare it.
	
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	Ben smiles, happier than we've ever seen him. He gets her 
	order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon 
	bottle. He sits on the edge of the bed.
	
	The bathroom door opens and Sera comes in wearing a black bra 
	and panties. She's acting the hooker now, tough and sexy.
	
				SERA
		For two-fifty we can do 
		pretty much what you want. 
		You've been drinking, so it 
		might be better if I got on 
		top, but the other way's fine 
		too. I have some jelly in 
		case you want to fuck my ass, 
		that's up to you. If you want 
		to come in my face, that's OK 
		too, just try to keep it out 
		of my hair, I just washed 
		it... and my eyes, it stings.
		
	She walks to the table and downs her tequila in one. Then 
	comes to the bed, where Ben is sitting. She kneels, unzips 
	his fly and begins sucking him. Ben watches her, looks at her 
	reflection in the closet mirror, reaches for the bottle and 
	drinks some, being careful not to disturb Sera. After a while 
	Sera comes up.
	
				SERA
		Do you want to fuck now?
	
				BEN
			(confused)
		Maybe another drink first. 
			More tequila?
	
				SERA
		OK... whatever.
	
	She takes the bottle and drinks. She goes down again. Ben 
	stops her.
	
				SERA
		What's the story? Are you too 
		drunk to come?
	
				BEN
			(sincere)
		I don't care about that. 
		There's time left. You can 
		have more money. You can 
		drink all you want. You can 
		talk or listen. Just stay, 
		that's all I  want.
		
	She looks at him, confused. She sees a strange look on his 
	face. It throws her.
	
	This is a turning point. Both of them are momentarily 
	exposed.
	
	Ben lifts the sheet and moves to one side, indicating that 
	she should come into the bed. She's as confused as he is. She 
	gets in with him and he hands her the bottle.

	They both laugh and Ben hands her the bottle.
	
				BEN
		No, I came here to 
		drink... myself... you know... 
	
				SERA
		To death?
	
				BEN
		Yes, that's right.
	
	He looks at her, she at him, not sure whether to believe him 
	or not.
	
				BEN
		I cashed in all of my money, 
		paid my AmEx card, gonna sell

				SERA
		How long's it gonna take, for

				BEN
		I think about four weeks, and 
		I've got enough for about two 
		hundred and fifty to three 
		hundred dollars a day.

		Yes... that should do it. What

				BEN
		Yeah. And your meter just ran 
		out.
	
	Ben looks at his watch.
	
				SERA
		It's OK... nice watch. Go on. 
		Talk some more.
		
	Ben yawns, suddenly deeply tired.
	
				BEN
		In LA I kept running out of 
		booze and the store would be 
		closed because I'd forget to 
		look at my watch... so I 
		decided to move here because 
		nothing ever closes and 
		because I got tired of 
		getting funny looks when I 
		would walk into a bar at six 
		o'clock... even the bartenders 
		started preaching.

	Sera lets herself in. Yuri is standing in the shadows. She

				YURI
		Where have you been?
	
				SERA
		It was a slow night. I went 
		to a hotel for a few drinks.
		
	Yuri holds out his hand for her bag. She gives it to him. He 
	finds the money and counts it.
	
				YURI
		A full night on the street 
		and this is all?
	
				SERA
		Like I said... it was a slow 
		night... I'm sorry. It was

	Yuri slaps her.

		Don't hit me.
	
				YURI
		What do you think... you are 
		sixteen years old on

	Yuri talks in Russian, becoming angrier, and slaps her again. 
	He spits on the floor.
	
	Sera falls against the kitchen table and picks up a lethal-
	looking knife. Yuri stops. 
	
				SERA
		Maybe nobody wants to fuck a 
		chick with a cut on her 
		cheek.
		
	She throws the knife to Yuri, who catches it. She bends over 
	the table and pulls up her skirt.
	
				SERA
		There, go ahead!
	
	She mimics him.
	
	A shower of Russian comes out of Yuri, but he doesn't touch 
	her. He tries to regain his dignity by putting on a coat.

		I could kill you. You know

	He goes to the door.

	A lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a Tony Orlando 
	number. Sera sits at the bar, an empty seat on either side of 
	her. She watches a younger hooker in the final moments of 
	pulling a dangerous-looking man. The girl is aware of Sera 
	without even looking at her. The guy she is with looks around 
	and sees Sera. The girl shoots an icy look. A man sits next 
	to Sera: a conventioneer.
	
				CONVENTIONEER
		About ready for another 
		drink?
	
				SERA
		Yes, that would be great. Are 
		you her for the convention?
	
				CONVENTIONEER
		Do I look that obvious? My 
		name's Paul.
	
	They shake hands.
	
				SERA
		No, of course not, just a 
		wild guess. I'm Sera and 
		that's a margarita.
	
		The barman is already pouring. The young hooker leaves with 
	her dangerous guy. She pauses long enough to give Sera a 
	nasty smile. The conventioneer pays for the drink and is a 
	little lost for words. Sera tries to help.
	
				SERA
		So... are you alone, or are 
		you just using me to make 
		someone else jealous?

		Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.

		Where are you staying?

		Right here at the hotel. Why?

		Well... I thought you might be 
		looking for a date.
	
				CONVENTIONEER

		A date. What, are you a 
		hooker?
			(voice getting louder)
		What do you mean a date?

		I've got a wife back home. I

		I'm sorry, I guess I

		Please don't raise your

		Sorry. Look... you seem like a

	He gets up.

		Here, have another drink. I

		Sorry, Yuri... good

		think things are picking up.
		
	Yuri sits on the bed. He looks unwell and disoriented. His 
	face is covered with a thin film of sweat. He seems to be 
	listening for something, because he stops her talking by 
	putting his fingers to his lips. He looks at her and then 
		beckons her to the bed. Sera is nervous. As she walks to the 
	bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. Yuri stops her with a 
	wave of his hand. Sera is puzzled and frightened now. Yuri 
	seems to be deranged.
	
				YURI
		Have you told anyone that I'm 
		here?
	
				SERA
		No.
	
	Yuri suddenly hears something. He grabs Sera's hand and takes 
	her to the wall. He presses her head to the wall.
	
				YURI
		Do you here that?
	
	He looks at her.
	
				YURI
		They're talking about me.
	
	He pulls himself together.

		Go, Sera.

		Go. Stay at home. I will call

				SERA
		Yuri... are you... 
	
				YURI
			(patiently)
		Sera... please go.
	
	He indicates the wall.
	
				YURI
		This is very important... and 
		I must listen. Now go.
	
	They face each other for a moment and then Yuri does an 
	almost comic gesture to tell her to go. He hustles her to the 
	door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her 
	blouse. He slams the door. 
	
				YURI
			(through the door)
		Goodbye, Sera. Don't come 
		back here. I will not see you 
		again.
	
	Sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she 
		begins to walk. The camera follows her as she makes her way 
	down the endless corridor of doors. Ahead of her, three men 
	are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they 
	make their way. Sera doesn't take them in. They pass and turn 
	a corner. We recognize them as the men from the black 
	Town Car.

		No thanks... I'm fine.
	
	The tapping persists and eventually Ben gets off the bed and

				SERA
		Still want to have dinner?
	
	Ben stares at her for a while.
	
				BEN
		Yes.

		This is the home of an angel.

		Yes. Take your time. I'm

		Of course. Wow... you look

		Thank you. What time is it?

		I'm from the East. I went to

		The tough times are behind me

		good. It is as I would want 
		it to be. So, why are you a 
		drunk? 
	
				BEN
		Is that really what you want 
		to ask me? 
	
				SERA
		Yes.
	
				BEN
			(worried)
		Well, then I guess this is 
		our first date... or our last. 
		Until now, I wasn't sure it 
		was either.
		 
				SERA
		Very clever.
	
		Sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on 
	this.
	
				SERA
		First. It's our first. I'm 
		just concerned. So... why are 
		you killing yourself?
	
	
				BEN
		Interesting choice of words. 
		I don't remember. I just know 
		that I want to.
		
				SERA
		Want to kill yourself? Are 
		you saying  that you're 
		drinking as a way to kill 
		yourself?
	
	And she leans across the table to be close to him, listening 
	intently. Ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off. 
	
				BEN
		Or killing myself as a way to 
		drink.
	
	Sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real 
	answer. He takes a slug from his drink. She sits back.
	
				BEN
		We'll talk about it some 
		other time maybe. OK?
	
	Sera relaxes and continues with her food. We hear her 
	thoughts for a moment.
	
				SERA (v.o)
		It wasn't so important to me. 
		I mean, he never asked me why 
		I was a hooker, sand that was 
		impressive. I really liked 
		him. So I decided to just 
		play my part. I mean... it's 
		good to help someone once in 
		a while., it's a bonus to 
		being alive, and that was my 
		plan... to stay alive. I 
		suddenly came to a decision.
	
				BEN
		What are you thinking? Are 
		you angry with me?
		 
				SERA
				(decides something)
		Ben, why don't you stay at my 
		place tonight? I mean... look, 
		you're so drunk. I like you. 
		I trust you.
	
				BEN
		That's astonishing. Sera, 
		look... 
	
				SERA
		I hate to think of you in 
		that cheesy motel. I mean... 
	
	And she folds her arms and grins at him.
	
				SERA
		Let's face it, what the fuck 
		are you doing in Las Vegas?
	
				BEN
			(overwhelmed by her)
		I'm going to move to a smart 
		hotel, tomorrow if it'll make 
		you feel better.
			(looks at her)
		Let's talk about tomorrow. 
		Wanna do something?
	
				SERA
			(warmly)
		Sure... tonight. Then please 
		stay at my place.
	
				BEN
		Sera... you know I'm not much 
		good in the sack.
	
				SERA
		It's not about sex, Ben. I'll 
		make you up a bed on the 
		sofa. Do it for me. We can 
		talk till late and then sleep 
		till late. As you know, I am 
		my own boss.
		
	Ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his 
	laugh as infectious, and Sera join in. Other diners turn to 
	stare at them. They seem like a couple.
	 
	CUT TO:
	
	81 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Ben and Sera walk and talk, holding hands.
		
	82 EXT. DESERT - DAY
	
	A wide shot. The black Town Car makes its way across frame. 
	Left to right.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	83 INT. SERA'S house - day
	
	Ben is asleep on the sofa. As he wakes up, he becomes aware 
	that Sera is watching him from across the room. They smile at 
	each other.
	
				BEN
		How long have I been her?
	
				SERA
		Three nights, two days. When 
		is your rent coming up at the 
		motel?
	
				BEN
		I don't know.
			(sits up)
		I'll go and sort it out 
		today. Why don't you 
		come?... We'll find a real 
		room for me. You can pick it 
		out, a tower on the strip.
		
				SERA
		There's no reason to blow all 
		your money on a hotel room.
		
					BEN
		What do you mean?
	
				SERA
		What I mean is that you 
		should bring your stuff over 
		here. We're spending all this 
		time together... what the 
		fuck!
	
				BEN
		Sera... 
	
				SERA
		Let's face it, Ben, we're 
		having fun here. I've never 
		done so much talking in my 
		life.
		
				BEN
			Me neither.
	
				SERA
		So! Let's dispense with the 
		formalities. I want you 
		here... now!
	
				BEN
		Sera you are crazy.
	
				SERA
		So... I'm not too concerned 
		with long term plans.
	
				BEN
		Don't you think you'll get a 
		little bored living with a 
		drunk?
	
				SERA
		That is what I want. Why 
		don't you go and get your 
		stuff?
		
				BEN
		You haven't seen the worst of 
		it. These last few days I've 
		been very controlled. I knock 
		things over... I throw up all 
		the time.
			(looks at her)
		Now I feel really 
		good... You're like some kind 
		of antidote that mixes the 
		liquor and keeps me in 
		balance, but that won't last 
		forever. You'll get tired of 
		it really quickly. Believe 
		me.
		
	They sit in silence for a while.
	
				SERA
		OK, you go back to your hotel 
		and I'll go back to my 
		glamorous life of being 
		alone.
		
	She walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she 
	sits on the toilet to pee.
	
				SERA
			(to herself)
		The only thing I have to come 
		home to is a bottle of 
		Listerine to wash the taste 
		of come out of my mouth. I'm 
		tired of being alone... that's 
		what I'm tired of.
		
	She finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet. Pulling 
	up her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where Ben is 
	putting on his shoes. 
	
				SERA
		Don't you like me, Ben?
	
				BEN
			(devastated)
		Don't be silly?
	
	Ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in 
	love with her. He walks out of the room. She foolows.
	
				SERA
		We gotta decide this... right 
		now. Before we go any 
		further. You either stay here 
		with me or... 
	
	Ben turns to look at her.
	
				SERA
		... we can't see each other 
		any more.
		
	Ben and Sera look at each other for a long time.
	
				BEN
		Sera... what you don't 
		understand is... 
		 
				SERA
		What?
	
	Ben is deeply troubled. He comes to a decision.
	
				BEN
		You can never... never... ask 
		me to stop drinking. Do you 
		understand?
	
				SERA
			(dead serious)
		I do. I really do.
			(smiles)
		OK. I have to do some 
		shopping alone. You go out 
		for a few drinks and then 
		pick up your things. Don't 
		hurry and I'll be back before 
		you to let you in.
		
	Sera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance 
	and into the wall. She kisses him all over his face and 
	squeezes his skinny frame.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	84 INT. BEN'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL - DAY
	
	Ben is packing his liquor into his suitcase. The almost-empty 
	bottles he pours into a large cup, which he drinks from. The 
	suitcase is now full and Ben suddenly realizes that he hasn't 
	packed any clothes. They are all in a pile on the bed. He 
	talks to himself.
	
				BEN
		Maybe this isn't a good idea 
		after all.
		
	He tries to put clothes in with the bottles, but the lid 
	won't close. He sits on the bed and has an imaginary 
	conversation with Sera.
	
				BEN
		Listen, angel... the thing is 
		that I'm nuts about you and 
		this is a bad thing... because 
		my real plan is to die here 
		and you were never even part 
		of my plan... but like I said, 
		I'm nuts about you... wait a 
		minute, I have an idea, 
		angel.
		
	And he opens the closet and finds some plastic laundry bags, 
	which he puts his clothes in.
	
	85 SCENE CUT.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	86 EXT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
	
	Sera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside 
	her house. They stop her. They are also her landlord.
	
				HUSBAND
		We didn't know whether to 
		call the police or not.
	
	And they indicate the sleeping figure of Ben, in the doorway, 
	clutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow.
	
					WIFE
		He's been there for about 
		half an hour. My husband 
		thought he'd seen you two 
		together, but I thought it 
		best to wait until you got 
		home.
		
				SERA
		Yes, he's my friend. I guess 
		he just had a little too much 
		to drink.
			(smiling uncomfortably)
		I'll help him inside.
			(puts down her packages)
		Thanks for the concern. Sorry 
		to trouble you.
	
				HUSBAND
			(gallantly)
		Well, call me if there's 
		anything I can do.
		
	They go to their own house. Sera opens the front door, kneels 
	down next to Ben and shakes him gently.
	
				SERA
		Can you wake up?
	
	Ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful 
	expression.
	
				BEN
		Hi!
	
				SERA
		Why don't you go in and sit 
		down. I have some gifts for 
		you.
	
				BEN
		Right... OK... 
	
	Ben stands and almost loses his balance. He picks up his 
	suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but 
	she stop him.
	
				SERA
		Don't worry... I got'em.
	
	Ben staggers in with his case. As Sera enters, she looks 
	around and sees Husband and Wife at the window, still 
	watching.
	
				BEN (off-screen)
			Want a drink? Great nap. 
		Wanna go out tonight?
	
				SERA
		Seriously, Ben... I need to 
		keep pretty low-key around 
		here. Maybe next time you 
		could nap this side of the 
		door. That was the landlord.
		
				BEN
		Of course.
	
	She reaches into her purse.
	
				SERA
		Gift number one.
	
	And she gives him a newly cut key. He takes it and tries it 
	in the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
	
				BEN
		I used to carry a lot of 
		keys, but one by one they all 
		fell victim to the great 
		condensation. Now I have just 
		this one... which is... 
		
	And he tails off and stares at the floor. She waits for him 
	to continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm.
	
	87 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
	
				SERA
		Ben?
	
				BEN
		Sorry.
	
	He shakes his head.
	
				BEN
		I was miles away.
	
	He sees the parcels.
	
				BEN
		Ah... more gifts. I have to 
		sit down for this.
	
	He strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. She 
	follows.
	
				BEN
		Sera, I love that 
			name... S.E.R.A. Before we 
		proceed onwards, there is 
		something I need to say. OK?
		
				SERA
		OK.
	
				BEN
		I've come this far... here I 
		am, in your house. I want you 
		to let me pay the rent for 
		this month. All right?
		
	And he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen 
	until this matter is resolved.
	
				SERA
		Why?
	
				BEN
		Because... it's better for me 
		that way. OK?
	
				SERA
		Well... OK... 
	
	She is uncomfortable.
	
	They sit in silence for a while.
	
				BEN
		Sera... I hope that you 
		understand how I feel about 
		this. First of all, you're 
		welcome to my money. We can 
		buy a couple of cases of 
		liquor and you can have the 
		rest. But I don't think 
		you're talking to me right 
		now about money.
		
				SERA
			(smiling)
		No?
	
				BEN
		No. I think you're talking 
		about you. I'll tell you 
		right now that I'm in love 
		with you... but, be that as it 
		may, I'm not here to force my 
		twisted life into your soul.
		
				SERA
		I know that... 
		
				BEN
		... and I'm not here to demand 
		your attention to the point 
		where it changes your life. 
		We know I'm a drunk... but 
		that seems to be all right 
		with you. And I know that 
		you're a hooker. I hope you 
		understand that I'm a person 
		who is totally at ease with 
		this... which is not to say 
		that I'm indifferent or that 
		I don't care... I do... it 
		simply means that I trust and 
		accept your judgement. What 
		I'm saying is... that I hope 
		you understand that I 
		understand.
		
				SERA
		Thanks, I do understand. I 
		was worried about how that 
		would be... but now I'm not. 
		And you should know that 
		included with the rent here 
		is a complimentary blow job.
		
				BEN
		Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or 
		later we ought to fuck.
	
				SERA
		Whatever that means. Open 
		your presents.
	
	She hands him the larger of the two parcels.
	
				SERA
		Open this one first.
	
	Ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. A 
	genuine smile comes on to his face.
	
				BEN
		Very nice.
	
	He holds the shirt against himself.
	
				BEN
		This should work very nicely 
		with my suit, which, by the 
		way, is the only item of 
		clothing I brought over from 
		the motel with me.
			
	Sera raise an eyebrow.
	
				SERA
		Right... the suitcase was 
		clinking. So what did you do 
		with your clothes?
		
				BEN
			(laughing)
		I threw them into the 
		garbage., which was perhaps 
		immoral, but I wanted to come 
		to you clean, so to speak. I 
		thought we could go shopping 
		and pick up a pair of jeans 
		and forty-five pairs of 
		underwear and just throw them 
		out each day.
		
				SERA
			(smiling)
		Nice talk, Ben. Keep 
		drinking. In between the 
		hundred and one proof breath 
		and the occasional drool, 
		some interesting words fall 
		from your mouth.
		
	She hands him the last present.
	
				SERA
		Now, try this one.
	
	Ben unwraps the smallest gift. It is a silver hip flask. He 
	is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
	 
				BEN
		Well... looks like I'm with 
		the right girl.
		
	He turns it in his hands.
	
				BEN
		I must say that I'm very 
		impressed that you would buy 
		this for me. I know you 
		wouldn't do this without 
		thinking about it. 
		Funny... you did just what I 
		would have done.
		
	Ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. It is 
	fine. He walks to the door.
	
					BEN
		I'm going to fill it right 
		now.
	
				SERA
		Do you want to go gambling 
		tonight? We could go out and 
		play for a few hours.
		
	Ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit 
	pocket and has a drink.
	
				BEN
		I hadn't planned to 
		gamble... but if you would 
		keep the bulk of my money 
		here, then I could safely 
		blow a couple of hundred 
		bucks.
		
	He takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and 
	then gives her the rest.
	
				BEN
		Giving you money makes me 
		want to come.
	
				SERA
		Then come.
			(pause)
		I'm going to change. Watch 
		TV. I'll be half an hour.
	
	And she leaves. There is a slight edge to her voice and Ben 
	is not sure if he offended her or not. He watches through the 
	small angle of the door as she changes.
	
				SERA
		I am planning to go out and 
		do some work.
	
				BEN
		When?
	
				SERA
		Tomorrow night as a matter of 
		fact.
	
	88 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Ben and Sera walking. The camera follows them. He is wearing 
	his new shirt and looks good in it. She is wearing a green 
	dress and mismatched earrings and looks great. They walk and 
	talk.
	
					BEN
		I like your earrings.
	
	He changes sides.
	
				BEN
		I like women who wear 
		mismatched earrings.
	
				SERA
		Well, then... I hope we don't 
		run into any tonight.
	
				BEN
			(laughs)
		What do you mean?
	
				SERA
		I expect some kind of loyalty 
		here. Just because I fuck for 
		money doesn't give you cause 
		to start picking up women and 
		leaving me looking silly.
		
	And she stops and looks at him, smiling but serious. 
	
				BEN
		And I only have eyes for you. 
		And we both know that you 
		would never become 
		romantically involved with a 
		trick, right?
		
	89 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
	
	They walk around the huge space, which is full of people and 
	energy, and suddenly Ben grabs Sera and pushes her against a 
	slot machine and kisses her deeply. At first she resists and 
	then she gives in to him and responds. They knock over some 
	change, which falls to the floor, and Ben pulls from her a 
	beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to 
	the bemused player, before returning to Sera's mouth or more. 
	They break for air and then Ben leads her towards the bar. As 
	he waves to attract the barman's attention, she squeezes his 
	arm. 
	
				SERA
			(quietly)
		I love you.
	
	But he doesn't hear her.
	
	ANGLE ON CASINO ACTIVITY
	
	On long lens we see Ben and Sera at the bar. Suddenly Ben 
		seems to fall asleep. Sera tries to wake him and then he goes 
	crazy and falls backwards off his stool, knocking a waitress 
	and her drinks over. Security Guards appear and begin arguing 
	with Sera.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	90 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
	
	Ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. A night-light gives 
	a soft glow. He rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on 
	the floor. He crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door 
	and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. With 
	difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a 
	drink. He swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just 
	in case he has to vomit.
	
	91 INT. SERA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sera wakes and Ben comes in and gets into bed with her.
	
				SERA
		How are you doing?
	
				BEN
		Very well... umm... I never 
		expected to have to ask you 
		this again... but how did our 
		evening go? I remember 
		getting to the casino... I 
		remember kissing you... that 
		was really nice but 
		everything after that is a 
		blank.
		
				SERA
		Well - I was prepared for 
		worse, but it wasn't so bad. 
		We were sitting at the bar, 
		talking about blackjack. You 
		seemed just fine, a little 
		drunker than usual, but 
		nothing really strange, but 
		then your head started to 
		droop and I put my arm on 
		your shoulder and then, wham, 
		you swung you arm at me, and 
		fell backwards off your stool 
		into a cocktail waitress. You 
		smashed everything on her 
		tray, it was a real mess. You 
		kept yelling and yelling.
		
				BEN
		Oh, and what did you do?
		
				SERA
		I tried to shut you up and 
		help you to your feet but you 
		kept swinging at me - not 
		like you wanted to hit me, 
		but more just waving me away. 
		Security came and when you 
		saw them you stopped yelling. 
		They wanted to carry you out 
		and dump you on the street, 
		but I talked them into 
		letting me walk you out.
		
				BEN
		That's impressive. How did 
		you do that?
	
				SERA
		I told them you were an 
		alcoholic and T would take 
		you home. I also promised 
		that we would never come in 
		there again.
		
				BEN
		We?
	
				SERA
		Yes, we.
	
				BEN
			(holds her hand)
		What happened then?
	
				SERA
		You were OK for a while, so 
		we walked for about a block 
		and then you said you wanted 
		to go home and fuck, but I 
		think even you knew that 
		wasn't going to happen. We 
		got a cab and you asked him 
		to stop at a liquor store, 
		even though I told you that 
		we had plenty at home. In the 
		store you gave the kid a 
		hundred and told him to keep 
		the change. I asked you if 
		you knew it was a hundred. 
		You said you did, so I let 
		you do it. We got here, you 
		fell asleep on the couch and 
		I covered you up and came to 
		bed.
			
				BEN
		I warned you... 
			(kisses her hand)
		... but I'm sorry.
	
				SERA
		Here's my speech... 
			(kisses his hand)
		... I know this shouldn't be 
		acceptable to m, but it is. 
		Don't ask me why. I sense 
		that your trouble is very 
		big... and I'm scared for 
		you... and so I'm doing what I 
		think you need me to do. 
		Falling down in casinos is 
		little stuff. It doesn't 
		bother me. It has nothing to 
		do with us.
		
				BEN
		That's amazing. What are you? 
		Some sort of angel visiting 
		me from one of my drunk 
		fantasies? How can you be so 
		good?
		
	She turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl.
	
				SERA
		I don't know what you're 
		saying. I'm just using you. I 
		need you. Can we not talk 
		about it any more, please. 
		Not another word.
		
	He thinks about this. He gently pushes her until she is lying 
	on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes 
	her naked back. He kisses her in the small of her back.
	
				BEN
		Why don't you go back to 
		sleep. I'll go out and buy us 
		some breakfast.
		
				SERA
		Be careful.
	
	He stands and goes to the door.
	
				BEN
		Don't worry.
	
	As he leaves the room, she calls after him.
		
				SERA
		Ben, I'm  working tonight.
	
	He opens the door and smiles at her.
	
				BEN
		I know.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	92 EXT. SIDEWALK - EARLY MORNING
	
	Ben gets out of his  cab and walks up to the doorway of a 
	grocery store. It is locked. Ben looks at his wrist and then 
	remembers that he no longer has a watch. He looks around, 
	sees something and exits frame.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	93 INT. ROUGH ENGLISH BAR - EARLY MORNING
	
	Ben enters and makes his way to the bar. This is a dirty, 
	dark place. An ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing 
	by herself at the jukebox. A very drunk Biker Couple argue 
	noisily in a corner, slurring their words. There ins not much 
	gambling taking place at the eight slot machines. Ben sits at 
	the bar and the Bartender slaps down a paper napkin.
	
				BEN
		A beer and a double kamikaze 
		please.
	
				BARTENDER
		Sure thing. Anything to eat?
	
				BEN
		Not quite yet. First I have 
		to drink myself sober, 
		then... a few crackers, maybe 
		an egg and toast... 
		
	The Bartender walks away to get Ben's drinks, Ben continues 
	anyway.
	
				BEN
		... then I'll go home with the 
		groceries and we'll have 
		breakfast together, and 
		that'll make her feel better 
		about my condition... 
		
	Ben is interrupted by the arrival of the Biker Girl. She is 
	young tough and pretty. She puts an arm around him and 
	presses against him.
		
				BIKER GIRL
		Who the fuck are you talking 
		to, Mr?
			(laughing)
		Why are you all dressed up, 
		honey? My, don't you look 
		fine.
	
	She runs her tongue around her mouth.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		I am very bored with my date. 
		Would you like to buy me a 
		drink?
	
	Ben looks around and sees the Biker staring at the two of 
	them.
	
				BEN
			(loudly)
		Do you mind if I buy her a 
		drink?
		
				BIKER
		Fuck her. I don't care what 
		the fuck you do with her.
		
				BEN
		Maybe I could buy you both a 
		drink?
	
				BIKER
		Fuck you. Don't fuck with me, 
		motherfucker. Fuck off. Go to 
		it, she's waiting for her 
		drink.
	
	The Biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping 
	in quarters, never taking his eyes off Ben and the Girl.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		See what an asshole he is.
			(big smile)
		I'll have a rum and Coke.
	
				BEN
		Barman? A rum and Coke, 
		please.
	
	The Girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to Ben , who  
	is facing the bar on a stool. She brings her face closer to 
	his.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Can I stay with you for a 
		while?
	
				BEN
		You mean move in with me? 
		Isn't this a bit sudden?
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Oh, I don't have a lot of 
		stuff.
		
				BEN
			(smiling)
		I don't think my wife would 
		dig it too much.
	
	She moves to his ear to whisper.
	
				BIKER GIRL
		Maybe we could just go find a 
		room and fuck all day. You 
		wouldn't have to tell your 
		wife about that, would you? I 
		could suck you like this.
		
	And she begins sucking on his lobe. Behind them. At the slot 
	machine the Biker is still watching. His face fills with a 
	drunken rage.
	
				BEN
		See, the thing is... fucking 
		you would be wonderful, but I 
		am deeply in love with 
		Sera... 
		
	The Biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.
	
				BEN
		... and it's almost impossible 
		for me to imagine being with 
		someone else... 
		
	The Biker arrives at the bar and grabs Ben.
	
				BIKER
		Now listen, asshole, I'm not 
		gonna just sit around and 
		watch her suck on your ear.
		
	The Biker is about to hit Ben then holds back. He leans in 
	and puts his face next to Ben's.
	
				BIKER
		Now, I know that she came 
		over to you, like she does, 
			so I'm gonna pretend that 
		you're innocent and give you 
		one chance to walk out of 
		this place... right now.
		
				BIKER GIRL
			(to biker)
		Get lost, jerk.
	
	The Biker slaps her and then grabs Ben by the collar.
	
				BIKER
		What do you say?
	
	Ben shakes his arm free from the Biker's grip. He thinks 
	about it for a couple of beats and then decides.
	
				BEN
		I'm sorry... but she and I 
		have decided to spend a few 
		hours together in a mo -
		
	The Biker headbutts Ben in the face, sending him crashing off 
	his stool to the floor. His head cracks against the tiled 
	floor. The Biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt 
	front and punches him in the nose. Blood sprays on to his 
	face. The Biker walks out of the bar. The Girl follows him 
	quickly. The Bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to 
	where Ben is struggling to get up, holding his face. 
	
				BARTENDER
		You're quite a fighter.
	
	He gives him the towel.
	
				BARTENDER
		This may sound silly, but I'm 
		going to have to ask you to 
		leave. It's what we do around 
		here  when there's a fight. 
		Men's room is around the 
		back.

	from poolside.
	
				BEN
		I'm back.
	
	He walks into the living room and finds Sera reading on the 
		couch. She looks up and sees his face and his bloodstained 
	shirt.
	
				SERA
		Oh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look 
		at your face. You get in a 
		fight? I thought you didn't 
		fight. Goddammit. How do you 
		feel? Wait here. Sit down.
		
	She goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the 
	medicine cabinet.
	
				SERA (off-screen)
		Did you stop at the bar?
	
	She comes back into the room, armed with bottles and cotton 
	wool.
	
				SERA
		Did you say something stupid 
		to someone stupid?
	
	She goes to work on his face, dabbing an open cut with some 
	mercurochrome.
	
				BEN
		Absolutely not... ow... I was 
		defending the honor of some 
		poor wayward maiden.
		
	She thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the 
	forehead.
	
				SERA
		Why don't you go and finish 
		this in the bathroom. Take a 
		shower and put on your other 
		shirt. I'll fix breakfast and 
		then we'll go shopping and 
		get some new clothes. I think

	Ben and Sera come out of a clothing store. Ben is wearing

				SERA
		Very creative. Now we can get 
		you a black bow tie and you 
		can look like one of those 
			casino dealers.
	
				BEN
		OK, but remember that they

		I wear it because I want to. 
		That'll make me look

	Ben somehow gets on the 'down' escalator, leaving Sera on the 
	higher level.

	96 INT. SHOPPING MALL BAR. DAY
	
	Ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place. 
	Mothers with children, old people and a Waitress with 
	attitude. Ben tries to order but becomes angry when she 
	doesn't bring it straight away. People begin staring. At the 
	next table a dignified older man sits alone.
	
	Ben hands Sera a small package.
	
	CLOSE ANGLE
	
				BEN
		There was no time for me to 
		write a card, with you 
		breathing down my neck all 
		day., so you'll just have to 
		wing it, baby.
		
	He laughs and this induces a coughing fit. He downs his drink 
	and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she 
	should bring another.
	
				BEN
		Open it.
	
	She does so. It is a pair of onyx earrings. Black onyx set in 
	white gold.
	
				SERA
			(pleased)
		Your color.
	
				BEN
		I think you should wear one 
		at a time. One of these... and 
		one of your others. In fact, 
		I was going to buy just one, 
			but I didn't think it would 
		fly... as a gift, I mean.
		
	His new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away.
	
				SERA
		I'll wear them tonight... one 
		of them.
	
	She looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how 
	he is reacting. She smiles and Ben takes a deep swallow, 
	finishing his drink. His mood suddenly changes.
	
				BEN
		Yes... tonight. Put it on.
	
	She does so. Ben helps her, bringing his face down close to 
	hers.
	
				BEN
		You'll be able to feel it, 
		sharp and hot under your ear, 
		as one of the brothers is 
		driving your head, face down 
		into one of the penthouse 
		pillows.
		
	They are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said. 
	They sit in silence for a while. Sera is close to tears. Ben 
	gets up suddenly, puts down a couple of bills and walks away 
	from the table. When he is almost at the door Sera gets up 
	and quickly tries together up all of the packages.
	
				SERA
		Ben, wait... please wait for 
		me.
	
	ANGLE ON THE DOOR
	
	The dignified older Man stands in Ben's path and places his 
	hands on Ben's shoulders.
	
				MAN
		Maybe you should wait for 
		her, sir.
	
				BEN
		Why?
	
				MAN
		Because... you can hear in her 
		voice that she really wants 
		you to.
	
	Sera catches up and the Man lets go of Ben. Ben takes the 
		packages from Sera and the two of them step out into the 
	mall.

	They walk together.

		Can we just forget it?

		I don't understand any of

				BEN
		Can we just ignore it?
	
	They stop and look at each other. The PA system gives an 
	inane message.
	
				BEN
		Please!
	
				SERA
		Yes... I'll give you that.

		Thank you, Sera.

	They're under water for a long time. Ben exhales. Sera pushes 
	him towards the surface. 
	
	Ben and Sera come to the surface. Ben has swallowed water and 
	has a coughing fit. Sera hugs him until the fit passes. The

				SERA
		Years ago, in LA, I turned a 
		trick on Sunset and Western. 
		The guy was polite and didn't 
		argue about the price. He 
		parked his car and I took him 
		to a house that I had an 
		arrangement with. A fat 
		Mexican woman was watching a 
		TV and I told him to give her 
		the twenty for the room. 
		There were three or four 
		small naked children playing 
		on the floor and we had to 
		step over them to get into 
		the room. The room had a bed 
		and a dresser. He lay on his 
		back on the bed and I put a 
		rubber on him and sucked him 
		for a while until he was hard 
		and then I eased on to him. 
		About twenty minutes later 
		there was a knock on the door 
		and it was the woman saying 
		our time was up. I felt kind 
		of guilty because he hadn't 
		come and I offered to reason 
		with the woman and get 
		another ten minutes, but he 
		said it was all right and 
		began dressing. When we were 
		ready to leave the room he 
		stopped me and... hugged me 
		and kissed me on the cheek. 
		He gave me an extra hundred 
		as a tip and went back to his 
		car. I remember being 
		relieved that I wouldn't have 
		to work again that evening.
		
				BEN
		Last spring I happened to 
		walk past a house that I had 
		once patronized. There was a 
		cool breeze blowing off the 
		ocean and through the window 
		I could see a bare leg. The 
		girl must have been taking a 
		break between customers. It 
		was a strange moment for me 
		because it reminded me of my 
		mother and despite the fact 
		that I was late for something 
		already I just stayed there, 
		loving the atmosphere of it 
		and my memory and... the 
		reason I'm telling you  this 
		epilogue is that I felt that 
		I'd come full circle.
		
				SERA
		Where was that house? The one 
		in LA, I mean.
	
				BEN
		Fifth and Mayflower. You know 
		it?
	
					SERA
		Yes. One of my friends was 
		there. I wonder if you ever 
		clipped her.
		
	They watch the TV in silence for a while. Sera holds his 
	hand.

		I like it here with you.

	camera follows him as he goes...  
	
	108 EXT. POOL-SIDE - DAY
	
	... to the side of the pool, where Sera is sunbathing. He 
	lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling 
	a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped 
	table. He is pretty loaded. Sera turns over and moves out of 
	his shadow.
	
				SERA
		I've missed the best sun. Why 
		did you have to pawn your 
		watch?
		
				BEN
		I didn't know I'd ever need 
		it again.
	
	Sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving 
	board. As she takes a position at the end, she pulls the 
	bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive 
	into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out 
	near Ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends 
	down and kisses Ben for a long time. Ben responds and kisses 
	back. There is no one else around the pool.
	
	The kiss becomes heated and urgent and Sera sits on Ben, 
	making him wet from her. He pushes the top of her suit down 
	and kisses her breasts. She picks up the glass and drinks, 
	letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. 
	Ben drinks from her.
	
					BEN
		Take this off.
	
	He tries to pull her swimsuit down.
	
				SERA
		Maybe we should go inside. 
		Come on.
	
	She stands up, covering herself. Ben stands up, laughing, 
	loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. He falls 
	backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on 
	to the glass table. The table goes over and it and the 
	glasses all shatter on the concrete. Ben falls on the broken 
	glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. Glass 
	goes into the pool. Blood mingles with the water on the 
	steaming cement.
	
				BEN
		Whoops.
	
	Sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. She 
	kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of 
	glass sticking to him. Ben stands unsteadily.
	
				BEN
		I'll go and clean up. Perhaps 
		you could take care of this. 
	
	He indicates the mess, then walks to their room. Sera begins 
	carefully picking up the broken glass. The desk clerc appears 
	with a broom and a dustpan.
	
				DESK-CLERK
			(cheerfully)
		Everybody OK?
	
				SERA
		Yes, fine. Don't worry. We'll 
		pay for the chair, and I'll 
		clean all this up, the pool 
		too.
	
				DESK-CLERK
		Don't worry.
	
	He begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully 
	ignoring Sera.
	
				SERA
		You seem prepared for 
		accidents.
	
				DESK-CLERK
			(still smiling)
		Yeah... we get a lot of screw-
		ups here.
	
	He looks directly at Sera.
	
				DESK-CLERK
		Now, you two keep you loud 
		talk and your liquor to your

		tomorrow and after that I 
		don't want to see either of 
		you here again. I don't need 
		you paying for the chair or 
		cutting your pretty hands on 
		the glass. Let's leave it at

	Something funny catches Sera's attention. She laughs and sits 
	on the bed next to Ben.
	
				SERA (voice-over)
		I think we realized that we

		Don't your friends talk?
			(no answer)
		Try three-hundred for a half 
		hour.
	
				OTHER COLLEGE BOY
			(nervous)
		Three hundred for the hour.
	
				SERA
		OK... three... and we'll see 
		how it goes. Where are you 
		staying?
	
					TALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		The Yukon, room twenty-four.
	
				SERA
		I'll see you there in fifteen 
		minutes. You can pay me then. 
		Why don't you all take a 
		shower while you're waiting.
		
				OTHER COLLEGE BOY
		A shower? In fifteen minutes?
	
				SERA
		Look... I'll only need one of 
		you at a time. RIGHT? 
		UNDERSTOOD? So... the other 
		two can shower while I'm 
		there. OK?
		
	They walk off in a huddle, giggling - three small boys.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	126 EXT. YUKON MOTEL - NIGHT
	
	Sera drinks from a beer bottle as she approaches their room. 
	She talks to herself.
	
				SERA
		Where are the boys this 
		weekend, Frank? Why, hell, 
		Charlie, I sent 'em off to 
		learn the one thing I 
		couldn't teach 'em.
	
	She looks at the numbers and finds the room. She knocks and a 
	moment later the Tallest College Boy opens the door in his 
	jockey shorts.
	
	127 INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sera steps in. One boy is coming out of the bathroom wearing 
	a towel and the third is sitting in a chair smoking a 
	cigarette, which he passes to the boy in the towel. The other 
	boy is fooling around with a video camera. The atmosphere is 
	weird and Sera is suddenly alert.
	
	The Tallest College Boy hands her the money. He is very well 
	built, a football player. Sera hesitates, holding the money. 
	The Tallest College Boy closes the door and then leans 
	against it. They are all staring at her now. No one says 
	anything. Sera smiles suddenly and puts the money in her 
	purse. All business.
	
				SERA
		OK... where's the bedroom, and 
		who's first?
	
	They all look at each other.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		I want to fuck her in the 
		butt... 
	
	He looks at the other.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		... you too, right?
	
				SERA
		Forget that. No one's doing 
		that. You'll all go one at a 
		time. I f you want I'll suck 
		you instead, but that's all. 
		Then I'm out of here.
		
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
			(looking at tallest)
		You said I could fuck her in 
		the butt.
	
				OTHER COLLEGE BOY
		Shut up.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
			(shouting)
		It's my fucking money)
		
				SERA
		That's it... Take your money 
		back. I'm leaving.
	
	The Smallest College Boy gets off the bed and comes over to 
	Sera.
	
				SMALLEST COLLEGE BOY
		No... don't go.
	
	The Tallest Boy is still standing in front of the door and 
	things are getting strange. The Other Boy turns on the video 
	camera. Sera loses her cool.
	
				SERA
			(to the Smallest Boy)
		Maybe you'd like to fuck one 
		of your friends in the butt 
		instead.
	
	The room goes very quiet. The kid tears up. Sera tries to 
	back-pedal.
	
				SERA
		Hey... I'm sorry... 
	
	The kid punches her hard in the stomach, knocking her to the 
	ground.
	
	CUT TO BLACK:
	
	QUICK FADE IN:
	
	Close-up on Sera's face pushed into a bloodstained pillow, 
	her body being pounded from behind. The naked legs of two of 
	the boys behind her. We hear voices, filtered, from a long 
	way off.
	
				VOICE
		Go on... fuck her ass... 
	
				OTHER VOICE
		Look at me... look at 
		me... look at me.
	
	A hand comes into frame and pulls her head up by the hair. A 
	pair of legs moves in. There is the sound of a punch.
	
	FADE OUT:
	
	FADE IN:
	
	Sera's body on the floor. In the background trousers being 
	hastily pulled on to legs. The boys exit with sport bags.
		
	The last one turns out the lights and closes the door.
	
	FADE OUT:
	
	128 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN
	
	In the half-light Sera gets up and walks with difficulty to 
	the bathroom.
	
	129 INT. BATHROOM - DAWN
	
	She clicks on the mirror light. Her face is awful. One eye is 
	swollen almost shut. Her top lip is cut.
	
	CUT TO BLACK:
	
	130 INT. CAB - EARLY MORNING
	
	Sera gets into the cab with considerable difficulty. The cab 
	driver is a cynic.
	
				CAB DRIVER
		What's the matter, honey, get 
		a back-door delivery you 
		weren't expecting? You gonna 
		be able to pay the fare?
		
	Without speaking she takes out a twenty, leans forward and 
	drops it on the front passenger seat. He drives. Looks at her 
	in the mirror.
	
				CAB DRIVER
		Oh, don't wanna talk to me, 
		unh? Well, don't take it out 
		on me, I'm just covering my 
		ass. What the hell do you

	Sera opens the door and we see the Landlord. Behind him, on 
	the sidewalk, we can see his wife. He is embarrassed.
	
	ANGLE
	
	Sera, wearing dark glasses. She looks terrible. Her mouth is 
	swollen and some of the bruising around her eye is visible.

	CUT TO:

	The desk clerk is wearing a shirt of Ben's that we recognize

	CUT TO:
	
	136 EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT
	
	Sera walks alone. She's dejected as she looks for Ben.
	
	137 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
	
	Sera comes to an elevator and waits. She is wearing a thin 
	black top without a bra. Her bruised face makes her suddenly 
	very conspicuous and vulnerable. A big man in a white stetson 
	stands next to her. He looks at her and grins. She smiles, 
	coldly. He takes from his pocket two black, hundred dollar 
	chips, places one in each hand and deliberately places each 
	one against her nipples. Other people see this and stop and 
	watch. Sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man 
	becomes uncomfortable.
	
					STETSON MAN
		What's the problem, 
		honey?... You on strike?
	
	And he walks away laughing.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	138 EXT. 7-ELEVEN - DAY
	
	Sera is sitting on a freshly-painted red kerb. She smokes a 
	cigarette and doesn't give a damn that her short skirt is 
	somewhat revealing. Opposite her a bum is sleeping on the 
	pavement. For a moment it looks like Ben. The camera comes in 
	tight on to her face. She looks more lost that we've ever 
	seen her. She drinks coffee from a styrofoam cup. The sun is 
	bright and hot and traffic is noisy.
	
	139 INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
	Improvised scene. (5)
	
	140 INT. CASINO - NIGHT
	
	Sera comes in and the camera follows her as she makes her way 
	to the bar. She has covered up much of the bruising with 
	make-up but it is still pretty obvious. In wide shot we see 
	her strike up a conversation with the man next to her at the 
	bar.
	
	CLOSE SHOT - THE BAR
	
	A hand comes in to shot and grips her arm firmly. We see that 
	it is a casino security guard.
	
				SERA
		Let go. What's the problem.
	
				SECURITY GUARD
		We don't want you in here, 
		that's the problem. Let's go.
	
	And he jerks her arm. People are watching now.
	
				SERA
		Don't worry... If you don't 
		want me in here, then I don't 
		want to be in here. Just let 
		go of my arm and I'll walk 
		out of here.
	
				SECURITY GUARD
		Yeah... we'll both walk out 
		now.
	
	He steers her firmly across the floor.
		
	CUT TO:
	 
	141 EXT. CASINO. NIGHT
	
	They reach the sidewalk and, without relaxing his grip, he 
	grabs her between the legs with his free hand and says in her 
	ear:
	
				SECURITY GUARD
		Next time it won't be so 
		fucking easy.
	
	And he pushes her towards the street and walks back into the 
	Casino. Sera is shocked. She looks around and the group of 
	people who have stopped to watch the event move away.
	
	142 INT. SERA'S HOUSE - DAY
	
	Sera is throwing clothes into a suitcase.  The phone rings. 
	She thinks about it for a long time and then it stops. She 
	carries on packing and then the phone rings again. She pick 
	it up.

		Hello... hello...

		Ben? Where the fuck are you? 
		Give me the address.
	
	CUT TO:

		What in the hell happened to

				SERA
		Oh... it was an argument.

	144 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK
	
	The door opens. Ben is naked. His body looks bad. Leaving the 
	door open, he retreats to the bed.
	
	145 INT. BEN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
		
	Sera comes in, closing the door behind her. The shades are 
	drawn and the room is gloomy. Ben has got back into bed. She 
	comes to the bed and sits.
	
				SERA
		Ben... I've been looking for 
		You. Have You been here since 
		You left? It smells bad in 
		here. It's so dark.
		
	She clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his 
	face.
	
				BEN
		I wanted to see you... 
	
				SERA
		Oh, Ben... you look so very 
		sick... my love... you're so 
		pale.
	
	She goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face-cloth. 
	She wipes his face.
	
				BEN
		I wanted to see you... you're 
		my angel.
	
	He sits up painfully and finds a bottle, summoning up some 
	last strength to drink. His entire body shudders as he drains 
	the bottle. He puts it down and focuses on her for the first 
	time. H sees her damaged face, touches her face, looks at her 
	questioningly.  
	
				SERA
		Something went wrong... I'm 
		OK.
	
	Ben begins to cry and that sets her off.
	
				BEN
		I'm sorry I put us asunder.
	
	She shakes her head, unable to speak for the moment. She gets 
	into bed with him, kissing his face. She caresses his whole 
	body, which is shaking, possessed by an uncontrollable fever.
	
				BEN
		See how hard You make me 
		angel. 
	
	She excites him with her hand, kissing his face gently. When 
	he is about to come, she straddles him and brings him inside. 
	As he comes, he opens his eyes wide and looks at her.

		Yes.
	
	SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
	
	FADE IN:
	
	Sera is sleeping. A sudden gasp wakes her. Ben is having a

		Oh... I'm so sorry... 
	
	
	He smiles and turns his head away. He is very still.

LEGEND
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY by WILLIAM HJORTSBERG

2nd Draft Revised 10 March 1984


1EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven. 
Moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb. The setting is 
tranquil and utterly majestic.

Over the brow of a distant hill, a pair of brilliant light beams 
scintillate in an etheral ballet.

Numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder. They stand on 
the hillcrest, staring down as if at the Nativity.

Squirrels, quail, hedgehogs, mice, pheasants and badgers, natural 
enemies untied by the radiant LIGHT. 

A magnificent stag watches, numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his 
branching antlers.

1A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

PULL BACK: from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep 
embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster. 

A snarling face APPEARS under a mushroom cap. This is BLIX a brigand 
goblin hunter. Clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons, 
he is a terrifying figure. 

Blix WHISTLES. The SOUND is unexpectedly lovely, a nightingale's 
call. 

Further back, three other goblins return the BIRDCALL. They bristle 
with weaponry. POX is a pig-faced fop wearing tattered lace and 
flithy brocade. Tiny BLUNDER and TIC are both masked by grotesque 
helmets. Swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads. They creep 
forward to join Blix. 

1B GOBLIN'S POV : HILLTOP 

The distant animals silhouetted by dazzling LIGHT. 

1C EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

Blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest 
towards the hilltop.

A moth lands on a twig two feet from Tic's head. He turns. His 
incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the 
moth and retracting with it, quick as a flash.

As the goblins near the hilltop, the fantastic LIGHT gradually 
illuminates their hideous features. A tiny mouse runs out of the 
eye-slits on Blunder's helmet, circles the crest, and runs back in 
on the other side. 

Blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out.

The goblins crawl separately through the underbrush.

Pox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet. Terrified, the little 
shoat SQUEALS and scampers off. 

2 DELETED

2A CLOSE : ANIMALS 

Alerted by the NOISE, they face the impending threat. The startled 
animals run for cover down the hillside. 

3 DELETED 

3A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT 

Blix charges forward, brandishing his crossbow. 

BLIX: Kill. . . . ! 

Blix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond, 
closely followed by Tic, Pox, and Blunder. Brilliant clumps of 
forget-me-nots are everywhere, like disgarded jewels. 

3B GOBLIN'S POV : DISTANT FOREST 

The pair of shining LIGHT BEAMS race away between the trees. 

4 DELETED 

5 DELETED

5A EXTERIOR FOREST NIGHT

The goblins watch the LIGHT BEAMS disappear. Blix GROWLS in 
frustration. 

BLUNDER(musing): . . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . 
. . 

Blunder spots a SHINING silver hair caught on the bark. He reaches 
up and plucks it free. 

POX: What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap. 

BLUNDER: No! It's mine! 

Blunder hides the hair behind his back, but Pox quickly grabs the 
other end. 

POX: Give it to m-m-m-me! 

Both goblins pull on the hair. Miraculously, it does not break, but 
stretches between them like spun steel. 

BLUNDER: Turn loose, anus features! 

POX: Hard cheese! 

A furious tug of war. Pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully 
to cut the hair. 

BLUNDER: It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine! 

Blix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together. Pox and 
Blunder fall dazed to the ground. 

Blix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it. 

BLIX: Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. 
There be magic in this hair.
The beast ran off, faster and faster. 
We must take this to our Master. 

6 EXTERIOR VAST LANDSCAPE NIGHT 

An incredible landscape, fantastically contoured hills rise above 
the monnbright mist. The four goblins dismount, tie up their devil 
steeds, and disappear over the brow of a hill. 

6A EXTERIOR HILLSIDE NIGHT 

The goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate 
wasteland below. A mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far 
horizon. 

7 EXTERIOR SINISTER EVERGLADE NIGHT

A miasmic Jurassic swamp. Stunted trees rise like amputated limbs 
from the fetid water. 

The goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island, 
stepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to 
floating lily pads.
A cracked marble plinth juts out of the water. The goblins creep by 
a towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin. 

7A EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

A v-shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged 
crocodile. 

Blix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his 
game belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface. There is an angry 
swirl and it is gone. 

Blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting 
out of the water like a petrified serpant. 

The ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark. Blunder 
follows its progress with fear-widened eyes. 

BLUNDER:Wish i was still a leprecaun. . . .
Stay clear of nasty places
like this and do nothing all day but 
sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine. . . .

Furious, Blix turns on him, his finger to his lips. 

BLIX: Shhhh! 

Unchastened, Blunder whirls on Pox and repeats the gesture: 

BLUNDER: Shhhh! 

Pox follows suit with Tic: 

POX: Shhhh! 

Not to be outdone, Tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him. 

TIC: SHHHHH! 

7B EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

HAIRY MEG MUCKLEBONES rises out of the bog, huge and hideous. The 
water hag is half corpse, half serpant. She seizes Tic and 
disappears beneath the foul surface. The goblin's final CRY trembles 
in the chill night air. 

7C EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT
Blix, Pox, and Blunder are terrified. They scramble over the twisted 
root in a wild panic, leaping onto a floating log. 

BLUNDER: Run. . . . ! Panic. . . . ! Emergency. . . . ?

The log rolls beneath their frantic feet. They barely keep their 
balance. 

POX: Frog spit!

BLUNDER: Snail Sperm!

BLIX: All together. . . .now or never!

The goblin co-ordinate like tiny lumberjacks, running in unison. The 
rolling log drifts forward.

POX: J-j-jolly good! Team spirit and all that!

The log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore.

8 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

An enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle. 
Tangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a 
malformed sea monster. An atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the 
site. 

The goblins stare back across the bog. 

BLUNDER: Poor Tic. . . .

BLIX(growling with anger): Forget Tic! Less is always more.

POX: Better we spilt three ways than four! 

Blix hurries up the crumbling steps. Pox and Blunder follow. 

The steps lead under gigantic twisting roots. Blix finds a small 
opening and slips inside. 

Pox and Blunder like this less and less but follow their leader 
without complaint.

9 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

The three goblins tumble down a steep slope. The giant tree is a 
vast hollow stump, open to a moonlit sky, surrounding a smaller tree 
transfixed by a curved bronze horn, an instrument of unspeakable 
evil. 

Pox and Blunder stare up like open-mouthed tourists. Blix is 
impatient. 

BLIX: Boost me. . . . ! Hurry. . . . ! We must sound the summons 
before the dawn. . . . 

The three goblins form a teetering ladder with Blix wobbling at the 
top and Blunder crushed at the bottom. 

Blix blows into the horn with all his might. Nothing happens. 
Suddenly, he breaks wind! 

Pox and Blunder grimace. 

Blix blows again into the horn.

There is no sound. Dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell, 
followed by three SQUEALING bats. 

The supporting goblins wobble. Pox steps on Blunder's head. 

Blix blows a third time into the great horn. 

The unholy SOUND reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed 
souls in Purgatiory. 

10 EXTERIOR FOREST(VARIOUS ANGLES) NIGHT

As the evil SOUND moans, the forest creatures react with terror. 

Squirrels, rabbits, and mice dart fearfully for cover. Birds flock 
to their nests. Only the night creatures, the wolves, weasels, and 
owls perk up thier ears to listen.

11 INTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots.

BLUNDER: Now what. . . . ?

BLIX: We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate! 

11A EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

The goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle. Blix 
sits apart from the others, staring out across at the bog. The light 
of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of 
the hollow tree.

Blix plays with the silver hair.

BLIX(to himself): Moving silent like the breeze.
Soft as shadows, still as trees,
Darkness be in all we sees. 
He lives in silence, he lives in fire, 
He lives in all that's dark and dire. 

A mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance. It is a 
black cloak, wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray. 

12 EXTERIOR BOG NIGHT 

The flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler. The 
wind presses it tight, revealing the skull through the cloth. 

Suddenly, the statue's head turns to look at the great tree. 

13 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT 

Blix walks to to the edge of the platform, peering into the night. 

BLIX: Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. 
That be where you find our sire.

The pedestal is empty. The statue of the fidder has vanished! 

Blix gets down on his knees, genuflecting, toward the the open bog. 

The black shadow of the LORD OF DARKNESS falls across him. 

Darkness towers over the ruined castle platform, a huge horned 
figure drpaed in bacl cloth. An awesome silence ensues. 

Blunder and Pox kneel, heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads. 

BLIX: Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! 
Strong like a lion, swift like a shark. 

Blix offers the silver hair up to Darkness. 

BLIX: Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for 
your amusment. 

Blunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from Blix. 

BLUNDER: Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the 
one who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold! 

There is a bight FLASH OF LIGHT. Blunder HOWLS with pain. 

Blunder stares at his arm in dismay. His hand is gone, magically 
replaced by a grotesque birdclaw. 

BLUNDER(stunned): Thank you, Lordship . . . . 

Blunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw. 

POX: Quite stylish, actually. . . . 

Darkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him. 

DARKNESS: Where. . . . ? 

BLIX: In the woods, six leagues back, 
'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track. 

DARKNESS: Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which
cast this spoor? 

BLIX: I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, 
What beast it be I do not know. 

DARKNESS: This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes 
this way rarely. . . I must have this creature!

BLIX: Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this 
creature. 

POX: Your instruction would be m-m-most 
ap-p-preciated. 

BLUNDER: Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge! 

DARKNESS: No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only 
lure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never 
fails. . . . 

BLIX: Name the bait, Lord. . . . 

DARKNESS: Innoncence! 

14 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

A beautiful flower-spangled meadow alive with songbirds.

Baby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels 
forage for acorns and nuts. 

A delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe. Clouds of 
multi-hued butterflies swirl overhead. 

Waist-deep in flower, a young princess skips SINGING across the 
meadow. Her name is LILI. She wears splendid brocades and carries a 
bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin. Like these blossoms, she is 
beautiful and fresh and innocent. 

Tiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders. She laughs 
as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips. 

LILI(singing): Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. 
Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky. 
Living river, turn light to diamonds,
When I look in my true love's eyes. 

Lili runs towards a distant thatched-roofed cottage. 

15 EXTERIOR BOULDER AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

Blix, Pox, and Blunder hide behind a boulder, watching the girl. 

BLIX(whipering): Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin 
pure. . . . 

15A EXTERIOR COTTAGE AT EDGE OF WOODS DAY 

The WOODCARVER'S WIFE is hangin up the washing when Lili sneaks from 
behind the cottage. 

Grinning micheviously, Lili unfastens one end of the clothes-line 
and lets it drop. 

The laundry flutters onto the new-mown grass, A sheet drpaes around 
the outraged wife. 

WIFE: Dad-blamed faeries! 

16 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY 

The cottage is snug and homey with smoke-blackened beams and hand-
pegged furniture. A WOODCARVER sleeps by his bench surrounded by 
wood-shavings and roughed-out toys. 

Lili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway. Her 
beauty is etheral, an angel descending. 

Finches peck at newly-made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool. 
They rise to the rafters as at Lili's approach. 

The Princess peeks around the room. She tiptoes to the hearth and 
lifts the stewpot lid, dipping a finger in for a taste. 

Spying the tarts, she grabs one and eats it hurriedly, leaving a 
telltale crumb on her upper lip. 

The clock tolls the hour. A carved wooden maiden piroettes from the 
interior, pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle. Lili 
is fancinated. 

The Woodcarver's Wife enters. She curtsies to the Princess. 

WIFE: God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy. 

LILI: I've not come to visit, Nell 

WIFE: Won't you stay for a tart? 

Nell pulls a tray from the oven. 

WIFE(cont): They're fresh-baked. 

LILI: I've no time today. 

WIFE(teasing): The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting. 

LILI: Nonsense! 

WIFE: Surely the king forbids such folly 

LILI: What my father doesn't know won't hurt him. 

WIFE: The wilful heart invites despair, 
Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair. 

With Nell's back turned, Lili steals another tart, hiding it among 
the flowers in her bouquet. 

LILI: Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me
out of the woods today.

WIFE: Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick
with spriggen and banshee!

LILI: Is that why you've hung a bell over the door? 

WIFE: Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe 
won't be stole by faeries. 

The Princess starts merrily for the sun-bright doorway. 

LILI(laughing): More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry 
yourself to death if you're not careful. 

Lili runs out like a naughty child. The Woodcarver's Wife 
leans against the door jamb and calls after her:

WIFE: Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! 
Stay away from old oaks! 

17 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH TO GLADE DAY 

Hiding behind a moss-coverd log, Blix, Pox, and Blunder watch 
Princess Lili run SINGING through the woods, oblivous to any sign of 
danger. 

BLIX(scowling): May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . 
Ain't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . ! 

18 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

A lovely glade surrounded by tall trees, Breathlessly, Lili runs in 
from the woods. She is familair with this spot. It is her trysting 
place 

LILI(calling): Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack! 

Lili looks around in exasperation. Behind her, something wild and 
mysterious swings through the trees like an animal. 

LILI(cont): Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me! 

Lili is apprehensive at getting no reply. She hears the RUSTLE of 
the leaves but does not see the sun-dappled figure leaping from limb 
to limb overhead. 

LILI(frightened)(cont): Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if 
you're here. . . . 

JACK O' THE GREEN, a legendry "Green Man" who lives the free life of 
a hermit in the woods, drops down from a tree behind the Princess, 
landing without a sound. He is barefoot, about sixteen, and wears 
woven ivy leaves and skins. 

Startled, Lili SCREAMS. 

LILI(cont): Jack! You scared the life out of me. 

Jack says nothing, staring at her shyly. Lili hands him the flowers. 

A JAY flies down out of the greenery and lands RASPING on Jack's 
shoulder. He imitates the bird expertedly, The Jay answers him in 
English: 

JAY: She brings a gift as fair as herself. 

Lili LAUGHS, It all seems magic to her. 

LILI: You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in 
the flowers. 

Jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart. He stuffs 
it immediately into his mouth. 

JACK: Mmmmmmm. . . . 

LILI: Sweet? 

JAY: Sweets from the sweet. 

JACK: I know someone sweeter.

Lili blushes. 

19 EXTERIOR ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST DAY

Concealed behind the trees, Blix, Pox and Blunder watch the Green 
Man and the Princess wander down a meandering path.

Pox picks a spider from his web, pops it in his mouth, and crunches 
it down with a happy smile.

19A EXTERIOR MEANDERING PATH DAY 

Several birds perch on Jack's head and shoulders. Squirrels, rabbits 
and hedgehogs play about his feet. Jack feeds them nuts and berries 
from his pouch, answering their chatter expertedly. Jack understands 
the language of all wild creatures. 

When a frisky wren flies warbling overhead, Lili hesitantly returns 
its call. 

JACK: That was very good. . . .just right. 

LILI: Teach me rabbit like you promised.

JACK: Rabbit is much harder than wren. 

LILI: Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father 
thinks I'm brilliant. . . 

Lili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears, causing 
reflected sunlight to shine in Jack's eyes. 

LILI(cont): See how brilliant I am! 

JACK(laughing): Stop it. . . . ! I can't see! 

LILI: Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom? 

Lili seems to glow with sunlight. Jack stares at her, rapt with 
love. 

JACK: Much more than wisdom dazzles me. 

Lili LAUGHS and hangs her madallion around his neck. 

LILI: Then teach me rabbit. 

JACK: Not today. . . . There's something really special I 
promised to show you. 

LILI(delighted): Oh, Jack. Do you mean it? 

JACK: If it pleases you. 

LILI: More than anything! 

JACK: This is their season. They won't pass here again 
for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you 
must do everything I tell you. 

LILI: I swear. . . on my honour! 

JACK: I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's 
sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, 
well. . . . 

LILI(impatient): What? Tell me! 

Jack unwraps the lace napkin from Lili's bouquet. 

JACK: You'll have to wear a blindfold. 

LILI(coyly): Don't you trust me, Jack? 

JACK: I'll always trust you, Lili. . . . 

20 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH, GLADE TO STREAM DAY 

Jack holds Lili's hand, leading her blindfolded along a path through 
the woods. Distant thunder RUMBLES. 

JACK: Storm's coming. . . .

LILI: Who cares? Haven't you a cosy place to hide? 

JACK: Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . . 

LILI: In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . 
I am only a pauper here. . . .

Jack turns to face a radiantly smiling Lili. He bends towards her, 
closer and closer, and, for a moment, seems about to steal a kiss. 
She waits, smiling, sensing what is about to happen. In the end, 
Jack's innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns 
away. Without his knowledge Lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and 
mischievously peeks. 

20A EXTERIOR BEHIND A TREE NEAR THE PATH DAY

The three goblin peer around a mossy trunk. 

BLUNDER: Yuck! Did you see what he was gonna do? 
Makes me want to puke!

BLIX: I swear by all the bats above, 
Nothing's quite so foul as love!

21 EXTERIOR UNICORN STREAM AND GLADE DAY 

A sun-glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest. 
Sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds, a stream flows down the middle. 

Jack leads Lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around 
her eyes. 

LILI(aewstruck): Oh, Jack. . . .! It's magic! 

21A EXTERIOR STREAMSIDE SHUBBERY DAY 

Some time has passed. Lili is uncomfortable and restless.

LILI: How much longer? 

JACK: Be patient! 

Lili kneels by the bank of the streem, cupping water into her hands. 
Jack stops her from drinking. 

LILI: I'm thristy! 

Jack points at a huge viper moving sinously along the bank. 

JACK: It's poisened the brook. 
No animal will drink here now. 

LILI(indignant): I want some water. 

JACK: Shhh! 

LILI: Don't tell me to be quiet. . . .! 
I'm a princess!

Jack pulls Lili back into hiding. 

JACK(very softly): Just watch! True royalty
approaches. . . .

22 EXTERIOR THE STREAM (JACK & LILI'S POV) DAY 

The radiant LIGHT BEAMS GLEAM through the trees. A moment later, a 
splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the 
stream. This is a stallion. He holds his head proudly. His mate 
stands at the edge of the woods. 

LILI(OS): Ohh....They're so beautiful.... 

The unicorn dips his horns into the stream. 

JACK(OS): The alicorn purifies the water. . . . 

The stallion watches his mare approach to drink. She is slighter and 
more delicate, but every inch as mignificent. 

JACK(cont)(OS): There's no creature with more 
power or magic. . . . As long as they roam the earth, 
evil cannot harm the pure of heart. . . .

23 EXTERIOR LARGE BOULDER OPPOSITE CLEARING DAY

The three goblins crouch hiding.

BLUNDER(disgusted): Ugly one-horned mules!

BLIX: Shhh! 

24 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The Princess is entranced.

LILI: Such grace. . . . Can you speak
their language?

JACK: A little. . . .it's very hard.
Unicorns talk only of love and laughter. 
Dark thoughts are almost impossible for 
them to express.

LILI: Oh Jack. . . I must touch one.

JACK(alarmed): No!

LILI: I want to!

Jack restrains the Princess when she attempts to get up from hiding.

JACK: It is forbidden. These are sacred 
animals.

LILI: Nothing is forbidden me!

JACK: Don't ever say that! You risk
your immortal soul. 

Lili pulls free and steps into the clearing.

LILI: You sound like my confessor. . . . 
I only want to touch one.

The Princess strides defiantly into the open meadow.

The unicorns watch the girl from across the stream. They snort and 
paw the ground.

Lili stands alone, holding her arms to the unicorns.

LILI(singing): Like a child feels watching a rainbow.
Like a brid feels the first time it flies
I feel magic stirring within me,
When I look in my true love's eyes.

The Stallion's nostrils flare. His strong neck arches. Sunlight 
gleams on his horn as he charges.

From Lili's POV the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards 
her acroos the stream.

The stallion rears and prances, racing around the Princess as if 
drawn foward on an invisable lead.

Jack watches from the underbrush, his outrage tinged with more than 
a touch of jealously.

25 EXTERIOR BOULDER DAY

Blix, Pox and Blunder peer from their hiding-place. Evil leers 
brighten their impish features.

POX(whipering): M-m-might as well be fish
in a barrel. . . One would hope for a 
t-t-touch more sp-p-port. . . .

Blix clamps his hand over Pox's mouth.

BLIX: Pox! Shut your yap!

26 EXTERIOR CLEARING DAY

The lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist. Lili 
makes no move as the trembling stallion stands before her, the 
rapier tip of his horn pressed against her breast. It is obvious he 
could kill her is an instant.

The Princess calmly reaches out and caresses his muzzle. 

LILI(singing): When the darkness falls like a curtain
And the rivers and streams turn to ice,
I have summer and daylight forever
When I look in my true love's eyes.

Across the stream, the mare paces back and forth, obviously 
agitated.

27 EXTERIOR BEHIND THE BOULDER DAY

Blix pulls a long black flute from his quiver. He takes a dried 
hornet from a black snail-shell with a hinged lid and slips it into 
his flute, aiming the instrument like a blowgun.

BLUNDER: Steady....take your time....
Don't miss...

Blix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl. His cheeks 
puff. There is a soft PHUT of expelled breath.


28 EXTERIOR CENTRE OF CLEARING DAY

The poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the 
haunch.

Stung, the unicorn bolts through the clearing, disappearing into the 
undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels.

The Princess stands be confused and bewildered.

Distant THUNDER disturbs the tranquility.

Jack rushes to Lili's side.

LILI: Oh, Jack, it was so lovely...
like a dream.

JACK(angry): You're lucky it wasn't a 
nightmare!

LILI: Don't be such a scold.... Come,
I'll chase your fears away.

The Princess takes Jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing.

29 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps. Leaping a 
deadfall log, the stallion stumbles. He struggles to his feet and 
continues running.

The three goblins gallop pell-mell on their devilish steeds. There 
is nothing comical about them now.

30 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack and Lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline 
pond.

LILI: Sweet William did a-hunting go,
In the wood where faeries dwell.
From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro,
Lost, O lost, all under thier spell.

31 EXTERIOR FOREST (UNICORN HUNT) DAY

The stallion stagger, his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen 
takes effect.

The mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck. It is a 
virulent ound, red and swollen.

The war-like SHOUTING of the goblins grows even closer.

The unicorns pause at a fork in the trail. The stallion motions with 
his head. Sadly, the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent 
path to safetly.

The stallion stands his ground. When the three goblin hunters gallop 
towards him, he turns and limps into the woods.

32 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack lies beside Lili, listening raptly to her poem.

LILI(reciting): Came he at last to where bluebells grow,
He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell.
He lay him down and did not know
The flower's sound was his own death knell.

And while he slept came teh lady fair,
And gathered him up behind her saddle.
Now, all young hunters of bluebells beware
Sweet William rode straight through the 
gate of Hell.

Jack is lost in Lili's smile.

JACK: When I get to heaven, I know just
how the angels will sound.

LILI(enjoying it): Do you flatter all the girls
like that, Jack?

JACK(embaressed) It's the truth.

Lili kisses Jack sweetly. He doesn't respond.

LILI(smiling): Are you afraid of my kiss?

JACK: I'm afraid you'll break my heart.

LILI: Then still your heart... You
are dear to me as life itself.

JACK: Only because I amuse you...Like some
trained bear!

LILI: That's not true! I do love
you, Jack. You must believe me!

JACK: And if I so....no good can come
from it. I am only a Green Man, without
land or title...no name or wealth to 
bring you.

The Princess her golden ring on and off her finger.

LILI: What does it matter. I don't care
about any of that.

JACK: But it does matter....! If not 
now....Someday. What about when the time 
comes for you to marry?

LILI: I want to marry you.

JACK: That's impossible!

LILI: Not if it's what you really 
want, Jack.

Lili shows Jack her ring.

LILI(cont): Don't you wish this was our
wedding ring?

JACK: What if I say yes...? Will my wish
come true?

LILI: It is my right as a princess to
set a challenge for my suitors.

Lili throws her ring high over their heads. It glitters through the 
air, tumbling over and over in the long drop to the pond.

LILI(cont): I will marry whoever finds this 
ring.

The ring spalshes into the cnetre of the pond. Jack strips off his 
leafy cloak and dives headlong from the cliff.

33 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

Sweat-streaked, the unicorn staggers out of the tree onto a sweeping 
green meadow brilliant with pink bloosoms. Froth bubbles on his 
nostrils. His wide azure eyes betray his panic.

The goblins ride onto the flower-bright meadow. They jump down from 
their mounts in a frenzy.

BLUNDER(excited): We got him now....!
We got him now!

The stallion stumbles forawrd, making a last futile effort to attack 
the goblins. Limbs leaden, head hanging, the noble animal settles 
against a sapling and slides to the ground.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. A wild wind whips the pink blossoms into 
the air.

34 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY 

The golden ring drifts down, tumbling in a lazy spiral.

Jack's pale form stabs through the crystal water. The distant glint 
of the sinking ring lures him on.

The ring settles into the mud at the bottom, concealed by waving 
weeds.

Jack searches blindly as clouds of silt billow about him.

35 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The three goblins advance towards the fallen unicorn through a pink 
blizzrd of wind blown blossoms.

35A EXTERIOR SKY DAY

The black clouds boil and CRASH, thunderheads mounting one upon 
another in a dark maelstrom.

36 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The goblins stands around the fallen unicorn. Blunder turns away as 
Pox seizes the end of the alicorn, lifting it off the ground. Blix 
swings an evil battle-axe high up over his head.

Jagged lightning splits the raging darkness as the black blade 
falls.

Blix waves the severed alicorn in triumph.

The whirling pink petals turn instantly into white snowflakes.

37 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Apolcalyptic winds SCREAM through the forest. Lightning FLASHES.

The world is plunged into winter darkness.

Lili clings to a tree trunk.

LILI(in desparation): Jack! Help me!

The Princess can't maintain her grip. The icy blasts knock her to 
the ground and she crawls to the cliff edge.

LILI(cont)(screaming): Jack!

The her horror, Lili sees a skin of ice form over the surface of the 
pond.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Oh, dear God.... Jack.....
no....

Fighting the raging winds, Lili stumbles to the pond and pounds on 
the ice in frustration. It is no use.

LILI (cont): ....got to get help!

Frantically, Lili runs off into the storm-whipped woods.

38 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER RING POND DAY

Jack turns and looks up at the dark surface. He storkes upwards, 
only to bump his head into something solid at the top. The pond is 
covered by a sheet of ice!

39 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Jack's contorted face is seen through the ice.

He breaks the frozen surface with his fist and his gasping head 
thrusts into the air.

JACK(shouting): Lili....!

His words are lost on the wind.

40 EXTERIOR COTTAGE MEADOW DAY 

Winter shrouds the tiny homestead. Immobile goats, chickens and 
ducks stand silent as snow statues in the farmyard.

Lili runs from the frozen forest and stumbles up the cottage steps. 

41 INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

The Princess barges in, wild-eyed and distraught.

Frost rimes the walls and furnishings. Everything glisten like sugar 
candy. The Woodcarver and his wife are frozen solid.

LILI: Nell....! Arthur....!

Lili touches the wife's gelid cheek.

LILI: Nell....? Oh, nooooo!

Lili is shocked to discover the wife is frozen.

The Princes throws herself sobbing across the bed.

SOUNDS of SNORTING and SHOUTING come from outside
. 
Lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove.

42 LILI'S POV : THROUGH WINDOW

The noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal 
bones. They stop outside and clamber out. Blix has the alicorn 
tucked under his arm.

43 INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Terrified, Lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder 
to the loft.

43A INTERIOR COTTAGE LOFT DAY

Barrels and chests are stored here. Cured bacon and hams hang from 
the rafters. Lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a 
butter churn. She wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an 
open trunk.

Snows blows in through a hole in the roof, covering the floor 
timbers. Three-inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the 
cottage interior.

43B LILI'S POV : BETWEEN PLANKS

The front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside.

BLIX: Mortal world turned to ice,
Here be goblins' paradise!

43C INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past 
the frozen tarts.

BLUNDER: Lots to eat!

Pox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby, baring 
his tusks for the feast.

POX: I s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat!

BLUNDER: What're you....? Some kinda animal?

Horrified, Lili GASPS (OS) in the loft.

The goblins cock their ears to listen. Pox SNARLS and drops the baby 
back in the cradle.

Curious, Blunder starts up the ladder to the loft, but changes his 
mind half-way, more interested in what Blix is doing.

BLIX: Why eat cold? It's better hot!

Blix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth. It 
begins to steam and bubble, magically boiling without a fire 
underneath.

POX: Am-m-mazing! How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap?

Blix is equally surprised by the alicorn's power. He CACKLES and 
aims it at the clock on the mantle.

The clock's hand spin wildly around backwards, the carved figures 
darting in and out at fives times their normal speed.

Blix launches on an orgy of destruction, waving the alicorn like a 
magic wand. Plates shatter, the cradle rocks. furniture topples, 
Toby mugs come WAILING alive, painted wooden toys dance and caper.

The goblins SHRIEK with impish joy.

43D INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor.

Blix points the alicorn straight up. Snow flies wildly around the 
crouching Princess.

The broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded 
loft.

It is all the Princess can do to keep from screaming.

43E INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

As a grand finale, Blix points at Nell's frozen figure, blowing her 
skirts above her waist.

POX(languidly): M-m-most amusing Blix....most
terribly amusing.

BLUNDER: This is sure our lucky day.
Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop
on a birthday cake!

BLIX: Prattle, prattle like a priest!
(pointing to himself)
It was me who shoot the beast!

POX: Without the p-p-princess for bait,
you'd never gotten close....
B-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast
to bay.

BLUNDER: She's so sweet....I could
eat her brains like jam!

43F INTERIOR LOFT (FROZEN) DAY

Lili slumps against the wall, aghast at what she's just overheard.

43G INTERIOR COTTAGE DAY

Blunder and Pox fill a sack with frozen tarts.

POX: I'd like such her b-b-bones!

Blix points the alicorn at the cottage door. It flies open with a 
CRASH.

BLIX: Better hurry! Can't be late!

Blix marches out of the door. The other two goblins follow, darrging 
their sacks of tarts.

BLUNDER: When we deliver that horn, 
Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big
reward.

Blunder and Pox leave, slamming the door behind them.

After a long pause, Lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the 
loft.

LILI: Oh, God.... God....

The Princess stumbles across the cottage towards Nell.

LILI(cont) What have I done...? I didn't
want the unicorn to die.... All I did
was touch it....

Lili pleads with the frozen Wife, as if begging for her forgiveness. 
She is interrupted by the gruff voice of a House BROWNIE.

BROWNIE(OS): You're a wicked, wicked girl!

Lili looks up and sees a long-bearded Brownie standing next to the 
clock on the mantle.

43H LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: The world is in a fine mess
because of you.

43I BROWNIE'S POV : LILIbr 
LILI(desperately) : I'll make it somehow....
I swear it...! I don't care what happens to
me.

43J LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Words...mere words.... Bolds
deeds be needed now! Look at you!
Pampered and soft! Never done a day's
work in your life....

LILI(OS): Who are you?

BROWNIE: Me...? I'm the house brownie...
I keep dust devils under the bed and all
the china cracked.... You know how a watched pot
never boils? I do that...and I'm
a wizard at turning sweet milk sour....

The front door CRASHES loudly open.

43K INTERIOR COTTAGE (FROZEN) DAY

Little Blunder swaggers into the cottage.

Lili covers her face with the quilt and holds herself rigid as if 
frozen. The Brownie ducks out of sight.

Blunder stalks to the kitchen table and pulls his axefree. He does a 
double-take on spotting the Princess. The tiny goblin can't remember 
can't remember if he saw her earlier or not.

He pokes her and lifts her skirt to peek at her legs. He is stopped 
short by Blix's angry CRY outside:

BLIX(OS): Blunder! Move your butt! On the double!

Blunder hurries to the door.

Lili relaxes when she hears it SLAM.

LILI: Thank God....

Lili looks up at the mantle.

LILI(cont) (sobbing): Can you....help me?

437 LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: Can I what?

LILI(OS): Help me....

BROWNIE(sadly): I'd like to....but I'm
a domestic sort of chap....no good at all
where demons are concerned....

43M BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

LILI: Then I'll do it myself! I'll follow those 
goblins....somehow.....
even if it costs my life!

43N LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

BROWNIE: I like your spirit! There's always 
hope when a brave heart back a noble cause....
but what chance have you? They have the alicorn!
The power is theirs!

43O BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess resolutely hurries about the cottage, gathering things 
to eat and other useful items.

LILI: I will do it! You'll see....I
fooled them now, didn't I.... Well,
I'll do it again easy as pie....

Lili starts for the door.

BROWNIE(OS): Wait....! Take this....!

Lili turns back.

43P LILI'S POV : BROWNIE

The Brownie pulls a golden feather from his cap and tosses it down 
to Lili.

BROWNIE: 'Tis from the tail of the cockatrice....
Make you as fleet as a running deer. And better, when
things seem at their darkest, 'twill remind
you always that hope is alive....

43Q BROWNIE'S POV : LILI

The Princess tucks the feather into her bodice.

LILI: Thank you....Hope is just what
I need.

Lili rushes from the cottage back into the snow.

44 EXTERIOR FOREST (SNOW TRAVELER) DAY

A full-scale blizzard drives down through the naked tree limbs. Jack 
slogs forward, near frozen.

JACK(calling): Lili....! Lili....!

Jack sees a tiny bird, frozen solid on a branch. He takes it 
tenderly down, trying to warm it with his breath.

JACK(cont): What's happened....

Standing rigid all around him are numbers of frozen animals.

He can do nothing for the bird and trudges on into the storm.

JACK(cont)(calling): Lili....! 

Up ahead, the figure of a man is barely discernible.

Jack runs to the man, thinking himself saved..

Jack discovers the man is frozen, like the bird. His initial shock 
gives way to releif. The man is his salvation after all.

Quickly, he unties the stranger's travel bags and cloak.

JACK(cont): God rest your soul.... I know you
won't mind if I borrow your things.

Jack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel 
bag.

He scrapes together a pile of twigs, striking sparks with the flint 
and steel to start them smouldering.

45 DELETED : TRANSPOSED TO 46D

46 EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

A campfire blazes. Jack sleeps beside a tiny fire, shivering under 
his new cloak.

A tiny glowing LIGHT streaks out of the woods. It circles around 
Jack. The LIGHT touches the fire and it BLAZES up like a bonfire, 
waking Jack.

JACK: What....?

46A JACK'S POV : LIGHT

Jack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him. He sees a tiny 
woman-child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside. This is 
LUNA.

JACK (cont)(OS): Who're you?

46B EXTERIOR FAERIE CIRCLE NIGHT

Luna ZOOMS off into the treetops.

Jack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet.

JACK (cont): Who's there....?

Watching him through the drifting smoke in GUMP, an elf no more than 
the waist high. Slightly built, he is near-naked in spite of the 
cold. His face is that of a child, yet his eyes shine with a wisdom 
centuries old.

GUMP(smiling mysteriously): Here you be a forest
child and not know the Gump....

JACK: Gump, is it?

GUMP: Aye, Jack.... Honeythorn Gump at 
your service.....

The air is filled with frenzied CLICKS and SNAPS: stones tapping, 
stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc.

Numbers of green-glowing eyes stare at Jack out of the shadows.

JACK (frightened): How d'you know my name?

GUMP: How does a migrating swallow know 
the way south in winter....? Or a 
spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of
his birth from the black cold depths of the
mysterious sea....? I know everything, Jack!

JACK: Everything....? Why has this
happened? Why is it winter now?

GUMP: I'd be a powerful wizard indeed could I answer....
(shrewdly): Suppose you tell me , Jack.

Jack in uncomfortable.

JACK: Me? How can I do that?

GUMP: You know these woods as well as
any elf.... Did you not see 
something odd today? Any strange spirits?
Did nothing untoward happen?

JACK: No....well.... I took Lili to see
the unicorns.....

GUMP (furious): You did what?

Numbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods. They come 
in all sizes, from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen 
as big as small children.

BROWN TOM is a plump, tipsy leprechaun, draped with pots and pans 
like a tinker; SCREWBALL, a tiny pixie wearing an ill-fitting cap 
and garments tassle with flowers.

FAERIES (whispering in chorus): What....? 
Codfish and cockles....! Never....! Pewterpots and....
pumpkins....! Poo-poo pudding....! Doo-doo 
dumplings....! Shit-willy whatnot....!

GUMP: Silence!

The whipering stops. All eyes are on Jack. He writhes with guilt 
under thier scrunity.

JACK(deepling ashamed): Oh God, 
she touched him....

A GROAN rises from the crowd of faeries. They are outraged. Gump is 
the maddest of all. His face darkens. His eyes glow. He trembles 
with banshee fury.

GUMP: Touched it! A mortal laid hands 
on a unicorn?

BROWN TOM: Bad....terrible bad!

JACK: We meant no wrong.

GUMP (screaming): What was it you did 
mean, Jack!

JACK: Nothing....

GUMP (cold and hard): Nothing, he calls it!

JACK: I wanted to share something special 
with her.

GUMP: Well.... I have something now to share with you....a lively 
reel to warm your bones!

Gump magically pulls a violen out of thin air.

JACK: I'm in no mood for dancing.

GUMP(screaming with wrath): Squawk! Squawk!
No more talk.... Do you think you can
upset the order of the
universe and not pay the price?

Brown Tom produces ancient bag pipes, Screwball a tambourine. The 
other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly-shaped 
instryemnts : seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, 
blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles.

A wild and haunting overture begins. The rhythm is complusive.

Jack cannot control his body. His feet move against his will.

JACK(frantic): No! I want no part of
your nonsense.

Gump leers demonically.

GUMP: Time to dance, Jack!

Playing his fiddle, Gump is possessed, demonic.

Screwball beats on a log with a pair of shin bones. The faerie 
orchestra breaks into an other-world melody. Jack leaps and jumps 
like a zombie.

JACK: No...! Please....!

BROWN TOM(chanting): Round and round and round and round,
Before you're lost, you must be found
. 
The tempo increases. The musicians leap and cavort.

Jack twists and capers, dancing against his will.

SCREWBALL(chanting): In and out and up and down, 
Behind each smile there lurks a frown.

Gump leaps wildly, fiddling like a demon. Jack is a prisoner of the 
frenzied music.

BROWN TOM(chanting): Spin and spin and spin and spin, To learn to 
lose you first must win.

Gumps hops into the fire, dancing and playing as sparks leap about 
him. The music grows wilder. Jack will never survive.

SCREWBALL(chanting): Twist and reel and toe and heel,
The end to pain is to learn to feel!

Jack's face is a mask of agony. With supreme effort, he hurls 
himself onto the ground, his body jerking spasmodically to the 
music.

JACK(screaming):Enough!

The faerie orchestra falters, their tempo broken.

GUMP(angry): Is the music not to your liking?

JACK(gasping): I....won't....go....on...Take
my life, if you must.... What I did
is unforgiveable....
(boldly) But, I did it for love! And I'd do
it again! I love Lili with all my heart and
would sooner die than break a 
promise!

Gump stares at Jack. A tender expression softens his flinty eyes.

GUMP: Hmmmm..... Love, you say....? Love is 
another story....

JACK: I meant no disrespect....

GUMP: Answer me this riddle and
all is forgiven.

JACK: And if I cannot?

GUMP: Why, Jack....then 'tis your
death song I'll be playing.

JACK: Ask away, and pray God my answer
pleases you.

GUMP: What is a bell that does not ring,
Yet, its knell makes the angels sing?

Gump laughs, knowing Jack can't solve his riddle. Jack frowns in 
concentration, then grins, as the memory of Lili's song rushes back.

JACK: Bluebells!

GUMP: What?

JACK: The flower. Bluebells. To hear
then ringing means your life is
at an end.

Gump hurls his violin to the ground and stomps on it.

GUMP: Damnation! Codfish and cockles!
Gammon and trotters!

Screwball and Brown Tom run for cover as Gump explodes in an insane 
fury. He throws himself to the ground, kicking and SCREAMING.

GUMP(cont): Rabbot noodles....! Schweinhundt
saukraut mit schlagober....!
Piddle-puddles und ka-ka crumpets....!
Piss pots and thunder mugs!
Demkopf doo-doo brains riddle-widdler!

Abruptly, Gump stands and dusts himself off as if nothing had 
happened. He smiles at Jack and holds out his tiny hand.

GUMP(cont): You bested me, Jack....
Bested me.... bested me...

JACK(modestly): A riddle with an answer
is like an empty cup when you're 
thirsty for wine.

GUMP: Well spoke! And if it's wine you
want, it's wine we shall have.

Gump claps his hands and four tiny glasses magically APPEAR, 
floating in the air before them.

Another clap and Brown Tom's hat POPS off his head, revealing a wine 
bottle balanced underneath.

GUMP(cont): A small measure of entertainment 
at best.

Gumps snaps his fingers and the wine bottle floats off Brown Tom's 
head, pausing to in mid-air to fill each bobbing glass.

GUMP(cont): Elderberry wine....no finer drink 
under heaven.

Each one takes a glass. Gump raises his in a toast.

GUMP(cont): Here's to Jack....riddle-solver....
dancing fool, and faerie friend.

They all clink glasses. Jack regards his with suspicion.

JACK: I'm honoured, Gump....But no more tricks!

GUMP(to the others): Here be precious summertime frozen
into a winter memory and the blamed 
fool won't drink faerie wine for fear of
enchantment.

They all drink, Jack with some relunctance. The faeries enjoy the 
wine. Jack gags, as if he's swallowed fire.

JACK(coughing): Pranks....! Is that all you're good
for....! I've lost Lili....! Gump!
Help me! Use your magic to find her....
set the world right.

GUMP: Changing this frozen hell is beyond
my modest powers.

JACK: Is there nothing you can do?

GUMP: If you want more tricks, I'm your
man.... but, for big questions, you must 
go elsewhere.

JACK: But don't you care what's happened?

GUMP: Course we care.... What good's the 
world locked in a season of death?
No folks to scare on a summer's
night....

BROWN TOM: No babies to tickle....

SCREWBALL: No lovers to tease....

GUMP: No more spells to cast....Does that
sound like an enjoyable prospect?

JACK: We must find the answer!

GUMP: That we must. But first, we better 
see that no harm's come to the
unicorns.

SCREWBALL: I sadly fear the worst....

Gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding
luminous flower lanterns.

46C EXTERIOR DEEP FOREST NIGHT

Seen from a distance, the lantern-lit faerie procession glows like 
foxfire between the massive trees.

46D EXTERIOR SNOW (LILI TRACKS GOBLINS) NIGHT

Princess Lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees, following the 
tracks of the goblins. The quilt is torn, her hair dishevelled. She 
pauses at the top of a small, steep hill. 

The tracks of the goblins' sleigh pass below.

Lili jumps from the hilltop, leaving the quilt floating behind like 
a discarded skin. It is an incrediable leap.

She lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs 
off, hair streaming behind, following the trail of the sled.

47 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA NIGHT

The faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow.

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's Nothing to 
be done?
Sing a little song
And have fun, fun, fun....

The silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie 
lanterns.

Led by Jack, the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion.

Wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins.

GUMP: This is goblins' work....
Powerful demons are agaisnt us!

Jack kneels sadly beside the ice-glazed unicorn.

The SOUND of CRASHING HOOFBEATS alerts the faeries as the mare 
unicorn thunders out of the trees.

BROWN TOM: Take cover, laddies!

The faeries dive for protection. Only Jack stands his ground.

The mare charges straight at Jack. He is knocked to his knees as she 
gallops past.

The unicorn wheels about. Jack scrambles to his feet.

She charges again, skidding to a stop on the frozen grass. Her 
alicorn is aimed straight at Jack's throat.

GUMP: Run, Jack!

JACK: The fault was mine. I owe her 
my life.

GUMP: Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility
is her gift in return.

The mare makes a soft NOISE deep in her throat. It is a cross 
between whale song and the cooing of doves.

Jack responds in kind, imitating the sound exactly.

SCREWBALL: What's he saying? What's
it mean?

BROWN TOM (shrugging): Search me.... I speak
some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn.

The unicorn continues, a SOUND as close to music as anything in 
nature. Jck listens intently and answers her.

GUMP: Come on Jack, don't keep us in
the dark.

JACK: The dark is where we'll stay....
We're cursed. All warmth and light
was lost when the stallion died.

BROWN TOM: Is there naught we can do?

JACK: We must get the alicorn back.
Only then will the world return to normal.

GUMP: And how do faeries fight a demon?

JACK: She says we're to find a champion....
a mortal, bold of heart and pure in
spirit.

SCREWBALL: Look....! Look....!

Screwball points to the mare's hoofprints in the snow. Tiny wild 
flowers spring to life within each indentation.

JACK: That is the warmth of her soul.
Not even death's icy hand can stop
it!

SCREWBALL: Little good her soul'll do us now.

BROWN TOM: Screwball's right. Where we gonna 
find a champion when every mortal can swing a
sword is froze stiff as an icicle?

GUMP: Don't give up so quick, lads.
(feeling Jack's arm)
You sure you're mortal?

JACK(indignant): Course I am!

BROWN TOM(dubious): What sort of mortal
speaks unicorn?

SCREWBALL: Why aren't you frozen then?

JACK: I don't know.... I was underwater....
and when I came up for air, everything
was covered with ice.

GUMP: You'll do.... We best get you
some weapons.

JACK(puzzled): Weapons....? What are they?

BROWN TOM (dubious): He's no champion,
Gump.

GUMP: We'll have to make him one....
or kill him trying....!
Follow me!

Gump leads Jack and the others into the woods. The unicorn follows. 

FAERIES(singing together): What can you do when there's
nothing to be done?
Sing a little song 
And have fun, fun, fun....

48 EXTERIOR GREAT TREE NIGHT

Lili creeps around the base of the tree, making no sound. She moves 
with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where 
she can watch the goblins.

Blix holds court, surrounded by a lantern's glow. Pox sits on a bit 
of crumbling masonary. Blunder watches Blix gesture with the 
alicorn.

BLIX: Look at us! Waiting around like
lackies....and for what? We're the 
ones with the power!

BLUNDER: You shouldn't talk like, Blix.
We gets in plenty big trouble!

BLIX: I'm not afraid! Not even Darkness lasts 
forever!

Blix aims the alicorn at Blunder, causing a burst of fire to erupt 
beneath the tiny, helmeted goblin.

Blunder YELPS and runs off, clutching his flaming backside.

Blix roars with laughte. Power has gone completely to his head.

BLIX (cont): Watch out, Pox!

Blix points the alicorn at Pox. Fire explodes beneath the pig-faced 
goblin. He leaps SCREAMING into the air.

Blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger.

BLIX (cont): Higher.... higher....
Burning fire! 
Making music
Like the choir!

Blunder and Pox watch Blix make the fire fountain into the air.

The heavens blaze. Lili is dazzled.

Something very strange is happening within the swirling column of 
flame. Gradually, a demonic face emerges,

Outlined in the fire we see the leering face of Darkness!

Pox and Blunder applaud Blix's rebellion.

POX/BLUNDER (chanting): Higher.... higher..
Burning fire!
Making music 
Like a choir!

The three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic Lord of 
Darkness flaming above them.

Blix tosses the alicorn into the air. Blunder unwittingly catches 
it.

BLIX: Greetings, Worship....

POX: W-w-welcome, Great Lord....
D-d-darkest of the ....

DARKNESS: Your devotion disgusts me? You 
insignificant strands of toad slobber!

Blix and Pox drop grovelling to their knees, covering their heads 
with leaves and dirt.

Blunder can't control himself. He rushes forward and points the 
alicorn up at Darkness.

BLUNDER: Hear me, you angels of light!
Your reign is over! A new order 
begins! All the imps of Hell will 
dance freely over this dark land....
I hold the power....

DARKNESS: Enough!

Darkness points a burning finger at Blunder. The alicorn is rippef 
from the goblin's graps and flies up to Darkness. Blunder YELPS in 
terror.

Something terrible happens: the ground around Blunder begins to 
soften. To his horror, the little goblin sinks under as if into 
quicksand.

BLUNDER: Please.... It was only a joke...
I didn't mean it.... Honest....!

Blunder is in up to his neck. 

BLUDNER (cont): Whatsamatter? Have you no sense of
humour? I hope you choke of faerie 
breath and flower petals!

Blunder's hand points up from the earth. Darkness ZAPS it, turning 
it to another chicken-claw!

Blunder is gone without a trace; sucked under with a disgusting 
SLURP.

Darknesss HOWLS his triumph to the heavens.

From her place of concealment, Lili overhears every word.

DARKNESS: Did you think this alicorn a mere
plaything....? With it my empire 
is eternal! Before I ruled only 
the night. Now, my minions will
frolic in darkness until the end 
of time.

Darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by Blix, 
tracing an arc of flames through the night.

Like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton, Darkness controls 
the fire's movements. The blaze twists and swirls across the black 
night, blazing meteor trails, bright as the aeora.

BLIX (fawning): Forgive this intrusion.... My
goblins are a free-spirited lot.
I like to encourage their....
initiative. What do you think of
this policy, Master?

Columns of flame shower around the Dark Lord and from within thier 
incendiary interiors, evil wraith-like spirits emerge, swirling like 
ghosts.

Bright as comets, numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their 
fiery master. Darkness stands in total control within their mighty 
conflagration, the alicorn his sceptre.

Suddenly, with the pure clarity of a BELL CHIME, the presence of 
DAYLIGHT is detected.

The reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it 
luminence over Darkness and the goblins.

DARKNESS (cont) (writhing): What is this light...?

Beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks.

Darkness recoils, wrapping his flaming cloak about him.

DARKNESS (cont): You killed the final unicorn....
Is this not true?

Blix and Pox exchange guilty looks.

BLIX: This is true....

POX: Undeniably t-t-true, Lord.

Darkness is on to them. He points with the alicorn.

DARKNESS: You lie! Here is dawn!

POX: Well.... almost t-t-true....
ess-s-sentially true....

BLIX: That stallion is dead, dead as dreams,
dead as legend....

DARKNESS: OUT WITH IT!

Sunlight is half-way to the ground. Darkness shrinks, shrivelling 
like a dying ember.

POX: But.... but.... the m-m-mare still
lives...

DARKNESS: If even one unicorn walks the 
earth, my power is not complete....

BLIX: Just a female.... She has no
power...
. 
The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire.

DARKNESS: Only the power of creation....?
Get that female....! I command
you.... In the name of Darkness....

Sunlight strikes the ground. Darkness is gone! His arm holding the 
alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear.

Lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the Great Tree.

49 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili runs straight into a driving blizzard. A distant SOUND alerts 
her and she pauses to listen.

It is Jack and the faeries, SINGING. Jack's voice carries above the 
others.

JACK & THE FAERIES (os): When times are hard and things look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

A look of astonished joy comes over Lili's face. As the SOUND of 
singing FADES, she runs towards it, calling eagerly.

LILI: Jack....! Ja-aack!

50 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard, all SINGING 
merrily.

JACK & THE FAERIES (singing): If your down, wearin' a frown,
That's the time to dance like a clown!

Jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen.

LILI (very faint) (os): Ja-aack.... Ja-aack....

JACK (bewildered): Lili....?

The SOUND of her distant call is erased by the howling storm. Jack 
sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up 
with the others.

51 EXTERIOR FOREST PATH DAY

Lili stops running. There is nothing but the wailing wind.

LILI (softly): Jack....? Oh, Jack....

A solitary tear starts from her eyes, only to freeze on her cheek 
like a diamond beauty spot.

LILI (cont): Please God.... help me!

Lili drops sobbing to her knees. Through her grief, she sees the 
unicorn's track in the snow, each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming 
flowers.

Her courage restored, Lili follows this meandering trail of 
burgeoning life through the forest.

52 EXTERIOR ENTRANCE TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Gumps leads the way a huge BOULDER lodged uner the roots of a giant 
tree.

GUMP (proudly): Here's my home, Jack.... What
d'you think of that for a front
door?

Jack thinks Gump is pulling his leg.

JACK (in jest): Be some job in getting it open.

GUMP: Think you so?

Gump WHISTLES. Immediately, two eyes blink open on the front of the 
boulder, and he is seen to have facial features.

BOULDER: Morning', Gump....

The Boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from 
under the tree roots, REVEALING the entrance to a cavern.

He promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows, his tiny 
stone feet kicking wildly in the air.

GUMP (bowing): After you, Jack....

Jack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots.

JACK: Thank you....

The other faeries follow, leading the unicorn.

53 INTERIOR MOUTH TO CAVE DAY

An earthern antechamber under the tree, high enough for Jack and the 
unicorn. There is a small wooden door at the far end, sealed with a 
bright brass padlock.

GUMP: Brown Tom. Stay here with the
unicorn and guard her well.

BROWN TOM: Like me own life!

GUMP: Better than that! She's the last 
of her kind.

Gump marches to the little wooden door. He inserts a finger into the 
padlock, twisting it like a key. Instantly, the pops apart. Gump 
opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond.

54 INTERIOR TUNNEL DAY

Tree roots twist down like dead men's fingers and clutch the ancient 
rune stones lodged in the earthen walls.

Gump and Screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel, but Jack is 
forced to crawl on his hands and knees. Luna flies above thier heads 
like a tiny neon insect.

GUMP: Right this way....

Gump pauses by another wooden door, sealed with a brass lock. He 
opens it instantly with his magic touch.

SCREWBALL: Home, sweet home!

55 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden 
chairs and tables, a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging 
from the ceiling. The simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles 
of treasure: gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins.

GUMP: Fit for a king's ramsom!

Jack in awe as he wades through the ankle-high loot.

JACK: Such riches.... I feel I must be
dreaming....

GUMP: If life is a dream, better you dread
the waking!

Screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over 
his head. He laughs like a child in a sandpit.

JACK: ....beautiful....

GUMP: Mere trinkets.... Let's find you
something useful.

Luna's golden LIGHT streaks down and whirls around Jack's head. He 
swats futilely at her.

JACK: Stop it....! Go away....!

GUMP: Easy.... Luna only seeks a little 
affection.

Luna hovers beside Jack's cheek.

JACK: I meant no disrespect, but....
ouch! Make her stop, will you,
Gump!

GUMP: Does your blood run so cold? You'll 
be a corpse before your time.

Gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full.

JACK: What does she want from me?

GUMP: Foolish question....
(handing Jack a goblet)
Drink, and wamr your heart.
The answer's at the bottom of 
your cup.

Jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously. This time, he is careful not to 
drink when the faeries do.

GUMP (cont): Now then.... down to business.

Gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard. It is a 
remarkably beautiful weapon. 

JACK: What's this....? Something to cook
with?

Gump and Screwball exchange a hopeless look.

GUMP(patiently): This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine
a weapon as you'll ever see.

JACK(curious: So, that's a weapon.... What's it
do?

SCREWBALL: World is doomed, if you ask me.

Screwball goes back to playing with the jewels.

Gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt.

GUMP: A little demonstration.

Gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down. 
The little elf is an expert swordsman. He whirls the weapon in a 
gleaming blur, slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half.

GUMP(cont): With such a blade you could behead
an ogre as easily as uncapping a 
soft-boiled egg.

JACK: That's really something.... Can I
try?

Gump hands the sword to Jack.

GUMP: You're the champion, aren't you?

Jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel-littered floor and 
tosses it into the air. As it flutters down, he swings wildly with 
the broadsword. Gump has to duck to avoid having his own head 
chopped off.

GUMP(cont): Watch out....! You'll get the hang of 
it in time.... Now, we best see 
about some armour..... Screwball!

SCREWBALL: Coming right up!

Screwball flips open the lid of a chest. Folded inside is a golden 
chain-mail coat of exquisite workmanship.

GUMP: Go on.... see if it fits.

Jack slips the coat over his head. It fits perfectly.

GUMP (nodding approval): It will turn a broadhead arrow
ar fifty yards.

SCREWBALL: He might pass for a champion in 
that.

GUMP: Have a look at yourself, Jack.
(pointing: Use yonder shield for a mirror.

JACK(confused): ....Shield?

GUMP(exasperated): The round shiny thing over there.

SCREWBALL: Clothes never made the man....

Gump silences Screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a 
small carved desk.

There is a loud, MUSICAL CHIME. Gump pulls a remarkable instrument 
from a pouch on his belt: a wonderous crystal globe filled with 
whirling miniature worlds.

GUMP(studying globe): Hmmm... getting late. Almost half-
way past the morning mayfly hatch...
. 
SCREWBALL(sullen): Too cold for mayflies now....
'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice.

GUMP: You first must know how 
to tell the time.

SCREWBALL: I ain't got nothing....

GUMP: No more chatter....! I've got work
to do.

Gump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging 
among his papers.

Jack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his 
reflection.

Luna round and round his head.

SCREWBALL: Think I'll brew some tea.

Screwball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling.

SCREWBALL(cont): Colt's foot and sassafrass...
Maybe a spot of spearmint....
St John's Wort not bad.... and
a little foxglove.

Screwball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs.

56 DELETED

57 EXTERIOR PATH TO GUMP'S CAVE DAY

The unicorn's flowering footprints lead Lili to Gump's cave.

She pauses to consider the situation. Snowflakes glisten in her 
tangled hair. She is fiercly beautiful.

Deciding nothing is amiss, Lili stalks silently inside.

58 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

A small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron 
skillet. The mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw. 
Brown Tom lies fast asleep against her flank.

The unicorn lifts her head when Lili tiptoes in.

Brown Tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet, snorting 
with rage.

BROWN TOM: What....? What....? 
Who's there?

LILI: I'm Princess Lili.... I.....

BROWN TOM: You! You're the cause of 
all our sorrow!

The Princess drops to her knees.

LILI: I know it was wrong.... Everything
is my fault.
(weeping)
Please.... please forgive me.

BROWN TOM: I ain't the one ye should be asking.

LILI: I want to make it up to her....
I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn 
to the Lord of Darkness!

BROWN TOM: Good lass! You're a plucky
little partridge at that.

LILI: We can't stay here! It's not safe!
Darkness sent the goblins to hunt
the mare... If I found her, so will
they....We msut go!

59 DELETED

60 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom looks past Lili to the mouth of the cave.

BROWN TOM: Too late!

Pox and Blix stand in the entrance, aiming their wicked, barbed 
arrows straight at the hearts of Lili and Brown Tom.

Brown Tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warrior's 
stance.

BROWN TOM: If you imps're looking for a
fight, ye've come to the chap
who'll oblige ye.

BLIX/POX: Kill....! K-k-kill...!
Kill...!

Blix and Pox loose their arrows, renocking the bows with incredible 
speed.

Brown Tom moves like lightning, using the skillet as a shirld to 
deflect the arrows raining about him.

Lili stands in front of the mare, striving to protect the unicorn's 
body with her own.

Brown Tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet. A fusillade of 
arrows CLANGS OFF its iron surface.

A lucky shot peirces Brown Tom's hat. Dark red liquid streams down 
his face. His eyes roll up in mortal terror.

BROWN TOM: Dick-o-Tuesday's duck! They've done
for me!

Brown Tom staggers in a dramatic half-circle, toppling straight over 
backwards, stiff as a board.

The mare unicorn rears WHINNYING on her hind-quarters.

The goblin hunters advance. Blix spreads a heavy net wide.

The black shadow on the net falls across Lili and the unicorn like 
an evil spider web.

61 INTERIOR GUMP'S CAVE DAY

Screwball's teapot steams merrily. He sits stop a jewel cask 
enjoying a cup. A horned Viking helmet several sizes too large 
covers his head down to the bridge of his nose.

Gump works at his desk, marking out distances on an ancient chart 
with a pair of golden dividers. Dozens of parchment mps are spread 
in front of him.

GUMP(muttering): Forty leagues from the Dragon's
Track.... another half-span past 
the basilisk den.

Gump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together.

GUMP (cont)(annoyed): Wirrikows and dopplegangers!

SCREWBALL: Spot of tea, Gump....?
Help calm your nerves...

GUMP: Not now! I'm busy with navigation.

On the other side of the cave, Jack practices a variety of thrusts 
and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield.

Luna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite.

JACK: That's not so bad.... What do you
think, Luna?

Jack studies his reflection in the shield.

There is a BURST OF LIGHT behind him. Luna materialises as a child-
sized woman with gossamer wings. She wraps her slender arms around 
his neck.

LUNA: I think you look like a hero.

JACK: What! H'd you do that?

Jack spins around, but Luna is gone. Only the tiny dot of LIGHT 
hovers in the air.

JACK(cont) (puzzled): Magic....

Jack looks back at the shield and there is a full-sized Luna hugging 
his reflection.

LUNA: Nobody knows nut you. it's our
secret....
(kissing his cheek)
Promise?

JACK (squirming): Don't do that.

LUNA(another kiss): Better promise....

JACK: All right, all right....
I promise.

A loud, MUSICAL CHIEME interrupts Gump's work. he looks around for 
his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight.

GUMP: Hmmmm...? Screwball!

SCREWBALL (all innocence): Something I can
do for you, Gump?

GUMP: Hand it over....!

Sheepishly, Screwball pulls Gump's timepeice from inside his tunic 
and gives it back.

SCREWBALL: Well, well, well....
how'd that get in there? Must be
some kinda magic...

GUMP: Sneak thief's magic!
(studies timepiece)
Jack! it's time we were on
our way!

At the SOUND of Gump's voice, Luna TRANSFORMS instantly back to a 
dot of light.

JACK: I'm ready as I'll ever be....

Jack picks up the shield and starts after Gump and Screwball. Luna 
flies overhead.

62 INTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVE DAY

Brown Tom lies flat on his back as Jack and the faeries emerge from 
the tunnel. 

Gump rushes to his fallen friend, lifting him in his arms.

GUMP: Brown Tom....? You can't be dead....!
Oh, this is is terrible.... terrible!

Brown Tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about.

BROWN TOM (in a daze): Why, Wisp.... 
they kill you, too?

GUMP: Course they didn't! What in blazes
are you talking about?

Brown Tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat.

BROWN TOM: Goblins shot me through
the brain pan.

Gump yanks off Brown Tom's hat. Bits of broken wine bottle tumble 
out. Gump reagrds his friend with scorn.

GUMP: Your brains are one spot an
arrow'd do no harm!

JACK: Where's the unicorn?

Sheepishly, Brown Tom pulls the arrow from his hat.

BROWN TOM: I'm afeered the goblins took her.
Did me best to fight them off, but
they swarmed up by the hundreds.... Horrid
creatures they were. The Princess warned 
me, but....

JACK: Princess Lili?

BROWN TOM: Aye.

JACK(overjoyed): She's alive!

BROWN TOM: She was living still 
when they killed me.

GUMP: You'll earn your champion's spurs
this day, Jack.... We'll follow their
tracks in the snow. Foul weather's on our
side for a change.

62A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY

Jack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns, into 
the teeth of a driving blizzard.

63 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Blix and Pox kneel nervously before the Throne of Darkness. A huge 
fire blazes in the hearth.

POX: Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest
of the dark!

BLIX: Though we be nothing in your sight,
We bow before your strength and might!

We hear Darkness speak, but see only his bat-winged shadow spread 
like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins.

DARKNESS (os): Can you fawning sycophants
do more than grovel? What of the task I set you?

POX: D-d-done, Lord. We have the 
m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn.

DARKNESS(os): Where is she?

BLIX: In the dungeon like a treasure, 
Awaiting your darkest pleasure.

DARKNESS (os): Very good.... You two are not
entirely devoid of talent.

POX: There's m-m-more, Sire....

BLIX: Though unworthy of your magnificence,
Trifles without consequence,
We present with all due deference....
A gift. 

DARKNESS (os): Gift....? What sort of gift?

BLIX: This thing you once called innocence.

DARKNESS (os): Innocence...? I must behold this 
wonder....

Darkness stares into the fire.

As Darkness grimps the arm of his throne, his fingers start to melt, 
dripping to the dank stone floor.

64 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling, speading like a 
stain across the curving stones.

Below, the unicorn is locked in a steel halter, a woven steel cable 
binding her to an iron windlass.

The Princess paces the dark and dripping cell. Her dress is in 
tatters, her hair tangled. There is something wild and free about 
her now, and yet she has never appeared more alluring.

The melting shadow of Darkness drips from the ceiling, forming a 
small demonic shape as it falls.

We hear the BEATING of Darkness' heart in time with each evil drip. 
The sound grows LOUDER and LOUDER until the echo reverberates within 
the vaulted chamber.

Lili is terrified. She looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm 
continues. The Princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorn's neck for 
comfort.

64A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness contemplates the raging flames, his heartbeat THUNDERING.

65 EXTERIOR HILL ABOVE GREAT TREE BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries stare out at the tree-crowned ruin and 
surrounding bog.

65A EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Jack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of 
mist.

JACK: Legend says the Dark Castle stood
in olden days when evil anarchy
ruled the land.... The wicked still
come here to sacrafice.

GUMP: They worship the demon....

SCREWBALL: It's ugly! I hate it!

GUMP: Good! You shall go first....

65B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

CLOSE ON: Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering 
eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows.

65C EXTERIOR BOG DAY

Although Jack is in no trouble, the water is rapidly growing too 
deep for the faeries. Gump urges Screwball forward:

GUMP: Go on! Hurry up!

SCREWBALL: All the time me.
Same old story.

Screwball clibs up onto a floating lily pad.

An undulating v-shaped wake moves through the water alongside as 
they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long, 
twisting root.

Without warning, an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and 
grabs Screwball. He is gone under the surface with a scream.

BROWN TOM: Screwball!

JACK: What was that?

GUMP: Big trouble!

Jack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where 
Screwball disappeared.

JACK: We've got to do something.

Before Jack can finish, Meg Mucklebones rises out of the bog behind 
him. She tosses Screwball aside and hauls Jack into her cadaverous 
embrace.

MEG: Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to
me, juicy boy!

Jack YELPS in horror.

MEG (cont): Who be this tender morsel
disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest?

JACK(terrified): They call me Green 
Jack ma'am.

The faeries watch in dismay.

BROWN TOM: Our champion's a goner, he is.

The fearsome hag pinches Jack with her wicked talons.

MEG: What a fine fat boy you are....

JACK: You don't mean to eat me,
do you ma'am?

MEG: Oh, indeed I do....

JACK: That would be a shame, Miss Meg.
You're so lovely. You deserve far 
better than scrawny little
me....

The flattery gives Hairy Meg a pause; she simply can't resist it.

MEG: Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack?

JACK: All the heavenly angels must 
envy your beauty.

MEG: Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make,
be the rest of you as sweet
as your tongue.

JACK: Let me go and I'll sing songs
of praise to you.

MEG: Let you go? Don't be daft. I've
had naught but muskrat and snakes 
all this month.... bit of rancid
goblin, too....

JACK: But....but....don't you like
my words?

MEG: Words are little help in 
filling an empty stomach....

JACK: Then fill your soul with loveliness.
Look into your glass and feast on
beauty.

MEG: There's no looking-glass here....
Sometimes, when the moon is full,
I'll chance to see my reflection
in the bog.

Jack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder.

JACK: My shield would serve you well.

Meg Mucklebones takes Jack's shield, partially releasing him from 
her clammy clutches.

MEG: What a splendid idea! 
You be so clever, Jack.

Hanging onto Jack with one hand, Hairy Meg bends over the shield.

JACK: Your radiance is the alchemy
that makes rusted steel shine like 
silver.

Meg primps and preens: an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her 
vanity table.

MEG: Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy
of any princess in the land.

While Meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection, Gump 
catches the Jack's eyes. The cunning elf silently mouths the word: 
'sword', pointing to his waist at the same time.

JACK: Better, you are a queen without
a peer.... a reigning angel.

Jack nods to Gump and silently draws his sword. Meg doesn't notice 
thing.

MEG: You have such discerning taste 
for so young a boy....

Meg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips.

MEG (cont): Come, Jack....give us
a kiss before dining.

Jack petrified with fear.

GUMP(shouting): Give her the kiss of 
cold steel, Jack!

Jack swings blindly with his eyes closed. It is a lucky stroke, Meg 
Mucklebones' head flies from her shoulders.

JACK(astonished): I did it!

The decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface.

GUMP: Like a chmapion, Jack.

BROWN TOM: Bravo!

JACK: How's Screwball?

SCREWBALL: Chewed, but not disgested....

Jack points his sword at the hollow tree.

JACK: Then on to victory!

FAERIES (all together): On to victory!

65D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

A huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth. Darkness stands before it, 
almost a shadow in his midnight cloak.

DARKNESS: I've been an exile for too long....
banished by the sun.... forced to
hide in the bowels of the earth....
On the eve of my greatest victory, this....
child of nature appears.... It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.... I could know 
her in an instant. She is helpless.... and yet....
(anguished)
What is wrong with me, Father?

A VOICE IN THE FIRE answers Darkness; majestic and sepulrchral; the 
flames billow out as it speaks:

VOICE: You hold the world in your grasp....
Supreme power belongs to you... yet 
your triumph is meaningless!

DARKNESS: Meaningless?

VOICE: What do you gain from it? What pleasure
comes from ruling a pack of imps and
goblins....? Souls already black.... This
innocent creature fascinates you because 
only she can appreciate the enormity
of your achievement.

DARKNESS: I'll take her then!

VOICE: A hollow victory! She remembers 
the world as it was, when she loves your
new order you will triumph! Woo her....
win her.... break her spirit....

DARKNESS: Thank you, Father.... Your
wisdom is ever my guide.

VOICE: Remember.... She must desire you....
nothing else matters!

65E EXTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries step ashore on the island. Gump makes a 
mystical sign with his hands.

JACK: What's that?

GUMP: For our protection, Jack. You must 
be ready.... Remember, Darkness is a liar....
a treacherous fiend! Don't listen to him. 
Never believe what you see.....

JACK: He won't fool me.

GUMP: Don't be so sure! No human has 
ever set foot in this place before! 
66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY

Jack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the 
inner tree.

Screwball starts to climb towards it.

SCREWBALL: What a nice big trumpet....! Bet
it sounds louder than anything....

Gump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants.

GUMP: Don't touch it! Our lives are
lost if it blows!

Jack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree.

JACK: In here! I've found a passage!

Jack drops inside.

66A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

The moment Jack enters the inner tree, a deep TREMOR reverberates 
through the subterranean Castle of Darkness.

Draped in shadows before the fire, the Dark Lord looks up at this 
disturbance.

DARKNESS (to the fire): I feel a presence....!
Some power invades my sanctity....

VOICE (from the flames): Every wolf suffers 
fleas.... 'tis easy enough to
scratch!

The flames surge out towards Darkness, embracing him.

67 INTERIOR TINY ANTECHAMBER DAY

Like the catacombs of Paris, the walls are decorated with bones and 
human skulls. At each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic 
head. Jack and the faeries stand looking up.

GUMP(gloomily): The decor of death....

BROWN TOM: Tells you somthing 'bout
him what lives here.

SCREWBALL: It's a dead end....

Jack searches along the ossuary walls.

JACK: Doesn't make sense.... Check
the walls. There must be some sort
of secret key....

Screwball doesn't join the other faeries in the search. He is 
attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble. Picking 
up three with a happy grin, he begins to juggle.

SCREWBALL: One-two-three....
fidde-dee-dee....

Gump sees what Screwball is doing and flies into a rage.

GUMP: Screwball! Drop those this 
minute!

Screwball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder. One lands 
in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along, gathering 
momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle.

The balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle. It is 
swallowed with an emphatic GULP.

All at once, the roof slides shut above.

BROWN TOM(alarmed): Newt-finger marmalade!

The floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet SCREAMING into 
empty space. Luna circles, a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit.

LUNA (wee voice): Oh, dear.... Oh, dear...

The tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down 
into the dark opening after her falling friends.

68 INTERIOR CAVE CHUTE DAY

Like prisoners on a fairground helter-skelter, Jack and the faeries 
spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute.

GUMP(singing): When times're hard and thing look bad,
Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....

JACK: How can you sing at a time
like this?

GUMP: Can you think of anything 
better to do?

They hurtle through festooned cobwebs, stirring up smokey clouds of 
ancient dust.

69 INTERIOR CAGE AND ALCOVE DAY

The end of the chute opens into an iron cage. Jack and the faeries 
tumble through onto a pile of straw. Luna is right behind, bright as 
a firefly.

BROWN TOM: Ouch! Ow!

SCREWBALL: Where are we?

Gump stares woefully at the iron bars.

GUMP: Some place we don't want to be!

A scuffling NOISE in the far side of the cage attracts their 
attention. Blunder pops up from a pile of straw, still wearing his 
helmet.

BLUNDER: Shhhh! What is this?
A chatterbox convention?
SCREWBALL: Who be you, bucket-head?

GUMP: Stay clear of that imp! He's
a hell hound goblin!

BLUNDER: What I am won't help me 
none, nor you neither....

Blunder pulls off his helmet. He is Screwball's indenical twin!

BLUNDER(cont): ....even if you is my brother!

Screwball can't believe his eyes.

SCREWBALL(astonished) Blunder...!

BLUNDER: Screwball....!

They rush into each other's arms.

GUMP (to Jack): A Buttercup family reunion....!
I can't believe it.... Last I remember,
he sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears
that turned out to be cow piss!

SCREWBALL: What happened to you?

BLUNDER(flexing his bird claw): It's a long story....
Let's just say I went look for adventure and 
found more'n I could handle....
Doesn't matter now anyway... We're all of us
in the same fix....

JACK: Just what sort of fix is that?

BLUNDER: The kitchen of the Lord of 
Darkness! All of us be on his menu!

SCREWBALL: I knew it! I knew it! Should
of stayed at home....

BLUNDER: That's right, brother, me'n you 
is barbeque!

BROWN TOM: Wish I had a drink....

JACK: Only dead meat waits for the
stewpot! Spring the lock, Gump!

Gump examines the huge padlock with a frown.

GUMP (wearily): Iron is sore trouble for elves.

SCREWBALL: Magic's no good against it.

Jack slumps down in the corner to think things over. The faeries 
mill about by the opposite wall.

Jack stares at the bars. Luna orbits his head.
JACK: I know I promised.... but it's the only way....

Luna buzzes him furiously.

JACK(cont): Sure it's a secret... It'll
keep forever when we're all dead....

Jack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of LIGHT.

JACK(cont) (to Gump): Why not have Luna fly
out between the bars and find a key?

GUMP(shaking his head): She's much too small....
could never lift it...

JACK(blurting it out): Not if she changes 
sizes like she can!

GUMP: What?

There is a bright FLASH of faerie-light and Luna stands full-sized 
before them, her gossamer wings a-tremble.

GUMP(cont)(outraged): You wilful sprite! How dare 
you keep such secrets?

LUNA: They're mine to keep! But I'll do
what you ask.... if you kiss me, Jack.

JACK: That's easy enough.

Jack kisses her chastely on the cheek.

LUNA: Call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?

JACK(eager to please): Sweeter than bee
pollen on a summer wind.

Luna moves in close to Jack.

LUNA: Sweet is the wind thats blows me to 
you....

Jack gently pushes her away.

JACK: It's not possible. I'm in love....

LUNA: A faerie's love makes anything 
possible....

A soft cocoom of faerie LIGHT engulfs Luna. She metamorphoses within 
it, emerging as Princess Lili.

LUNA/LILI: ....even you heart's desire.

Luna/Lili embraces Jack. It is sweet and tempting.

JACK(resisting): No.... this isn't real....

Screwball and Blunder giggle and snigger.

LUNA/LILI: Oh, but it is.... I'm warm and alive
and happy to be in your arms.

Jack is nearly enchanted, but after a delicious moment, he pushes 
away.

JACK: I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour!

A brilliant aura of faerie LIGHT envelops Luna/Lili and she 
TRANSFORMS into her true winged-form
. 
LUNA(bitterly): You....! You....mortal! I
could vex you! Dance you life away!

JACK: Threats can't make you love you.
Human hearts don't work that way.

LUNA: What care I for human heart?
Soft and spiritless as porridge!
A faerie's heart beats fierce and free.

There is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and, in an instant, Luna 
returns to a tiny dot of LIGHT.

JACK: Luna....?

Without an answer, Luna flies out between the iron bars.

JACK(cont) (to the faeries): I.... didn't mean
to hurt her.

GUMP(scornful): Your fine senseibilities
have left us here to rot.

The SOUND of heavy footsteps approaches, accompanied by rough, 
tuneless SINGING.

COOK(os): ....this li'l piggie went to market....
anudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat
pie, l'l piggie die....

BLUNDER: Oh, no! He's coming...!
Hide! Hide! Hide!

Blunder conceals himself under a pile of straw. A deformed shadow is 
cast across the cage.

SCREWBALL: Blunder's got the right idea!

Screwball hides in the straw. Jack and the other immediately do the 
same.

A fiendish demon COOK opens the cage door. He is ten feet tall and 
unspeakably ugly. He peers blindly inside, sniffing the air with his 
hideous nose.

COOK: ....pig-pig-pig...
. 
The Cook gropes inside the cage.

The Cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs 
Blunder.

BLUNDER: Help....! Lemme go...?
Turn me loose, you tub o' guts!

The cook hauls Blunder out, kicking and screaming. He locks the cage 
abd stumps away.

BLUNDER(cont): I hope I give you heart-burn!

After a bit, the faeries and Jack peer up out of the straw.

SCREWBALL(woefully): Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us....

BROWN TON: Lambs to the slaughter....

Jack draws his sword.

JACK: Not without a fight!

Transformed back to full-size, Luna tip-toes into the alcove outside 
the cage, her hands coyly behind her.

GUMP: Luna....!

LUNA(maliciously): You look like mourners at your
own funeral.

GUMP(angry): Come back to dance on 
our graves!

LUNA: I'd gladly frolic on Jack's....

She LAUGHS and holds up a large iron key.

LUNA(cont): ....but this cage shan't be 
your tomb!

Luna tosses the key in to Gump. Instantly, she reduces to a tiny dot 
of LIGHT and flies out of the alcove.

GUMP: Well done!

Gump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out. Screwball 
steps on Brown Tom's head in his eagerness.

SCREWBALL: Lemme outta this stink hole!

BROWN TOM: Mind you bleeding foot!

GUMP: Shhhh! 

Jack is the last of all.

JACK: Keep behind me in case
there's trouble.

Sword in hand, Jack ;eads the faeries out of the alcove into
the kitchen.

70 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY

Huge ovens belch fire and smoke. The vast hearth blazes. Like the 
lower reaches of Hell, the Dark Lord's kitchen is a place where all 
hope is abandoned.

Jack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze.

BROWN TOM: Terrible sight for a sober
man to see....

JACK: Quiet!

The demon Cooks blocks the way, chopping meat with a montrous 
cleaver, A SECOND COOK, every bit as terrifying, SNORES by the 
hearth. Trussed to a spit, Blunder hangs upside-down nearby.

Jack motions the faeries on. The blind Cook turns them, sniffing the 
air.

COOK: Whut be there?

Jack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows.

SCREWBALL: ....Back in the frying pan!

Gump clamps his hand over Screwball's mouth.

Grasping his cleaver, the Cook advances towards them.

COOK(sniffing): Be it live victuals?

From where he hangs, Blunder sees the faeries' plight.

BLUNDER(calling out): Hey....!
Lard belly!

The Cook turns, angered by this insult.

COOK: Whut say, pip-squeak?

BLUNDER: Two things down here look 
just alike!

COOK: Wuzzat?

BLUNDER: Your face and my ass!

The Cook GROWLS with fury.

COOK: Bash in you face! Den it no be 
so pretty!

The Cook backhands poor Blunder, smacking him about like a punching 
bag.

Jack and the faeries make a break for the exit.

Blunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds.

COOK(cont): Whut you got to say now,
pork pie?

Blunder rears back and punches the Cook in the jaw. Stunned,
he topples over over backwards a great CRASH.

70A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle. 
Darkness listens by the fire. 

DARKNESS: Do you feel it, Father....? 
A force....loose in my domain.... 

VOICE(out of fire): Guard well what is yours! 

DARKNESS(roaring): BRING INNOCENCE TO ME! 

71 INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

The faerie band gathers in the foul, dripping corridor. Irregular 
torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones. 

BROWN TOM (gasping for breath): 
.....saved....by a goblin.... Never 
thought....I'd see....the day.... 

JACK: Wish we could repay the favour! 

SCREWBALL: My brother can take of himself. 

GUMP: Screwball's right! It's more important 
we find the unicorn. 

JACK: And Lili! 

BROWN TOM: Where do we start? 

GUMP: We must find the dungeons. Legend has 
is they house such sirriw that death 
is a gift....albeit one rarely granted. 

Screwball sits down defiantly. 

SCREWBALL: Think I'll stay right here thank you 
very much. 

Gump grabs hold of Screwball's ear and hauls him back up. 

GUMP: Not so fast! You search with the 
rest of us! 

Screwball hugs Jack's leg. 

SCREWBALL: All right! I'm going with Jack! 

GUMP: No you won't. Be faster if we 
split up. 

Screwball looks both ways, deciding which seems safest. 

SCREWBALL: Fine! I'm going this way! 

BROWN TOM: I'm going that way! 

They both turn and collide, falling flat on their rumps. 

JACK: Wait....! Better to search in 
teams, Gump and me together. Brown 
TOm, you and Screwball look in the 
other direction. 

Gump hauls out his ornate timepeice. 

GUMP: Right! Let's synchronise! We meet 
back here in twice five hundred 
beats of a bluebird's heart. 

Brown Tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies 
its intricate interior. 

BROWN TOM: Best to allow another couple dozen 
butterfly breaths in case we get 
thirs....er, get lost.... 

GUMP: No grog shops down here, Brown Tom. 

JACK: Let's hurry! 

Jack and Gump run off along the corridor, followed by Luna's glowing 
LIGHT. Screwball watches without moving. 

SCREWBALL: Know what I want to know? 

BROWN TOM: What? 

SCREWBALL: Why me? 

Brown Tom gives Screwball a swift kick in his rear. 

BROWN TOM: Why not? 

The two little elves scamaper off together. 

SCREWBALL: I hate it....I hate it.... 
I hate it.... 

72 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

The iron-studded dungeon days swing magically open as Lili watches, 
her eyes aglow with animal fire. She crouches beside the unicorn, 
resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion. 

Lili rises like a sleepwalker, unable to resist the compulsion 
luring her toward the open doorway. 

The chained unicorn WHINNIES pitifully. Princess Lili looks back 
without expression as she leaves. 

73 DELETED 

74 DELETED 

75 INTERIOR ANOTHER CORRIDOR DAY 
Luna's bobbing LIGHT leads the way as Jack and Gump hurry along the 
rubble-choked corridor. Alerted by the SOUND of something, they dart 
into the shadows. 

GUMP: Quick, Jack! 

Jack and Gump watch in horror as a cracked EGG the size of a 
watermelon runs down the corridor on armor-scaled chicken legs, led 
on either side by a Demon holding a chain leash. 

Jack draws his sword. The Demons stop and the Egg begins to crack. 

JACK: I'll scramble that one! 

Gump restrains him. The Egg cracks apart. 

GUMP: Don't trust your eyes! All is 
enchanted here. 

The Egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges; a 
diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl. It emits a fearsome 
SHRIEK and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin 
attendant Demons. 

Jack and Gump hurry on in the opposite direction. 

75A INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom creep timorously forward. They are alerted 
by the SOUNDS of something approaching. A hideously deformed shadow 
fall across the opposite wall. 

The two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the 
shadows. 

It is Princess Lili! She passes the evles' hiding place as if in a 
trance. 

76 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast 
central of the undreground castle. Similiar viaducts, above and 
below, bridge the awesome chasm. 

The Green Man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all. 

JACK: Not even kings live like this.... 

On a high span above, Jack sees Princess Lili drifting by like a 
somnabulist. 

JACK (cont): My God! Gump, look! It's Lili! 

GUMP: Don't believe it, Jack. 

JACK (yelling): Lili ! 

The SOUND ECHOES through the vast space. 

77 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

The Princess pauses. A section of parapet has broken off and she 
wanders to the edge, staring down into the void. For a precarious 
moment, she teeters on the brink, seemingly about to fall. 

JACK (os) (calling): Li-li ! 
The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow 
edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug 
chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss. 

JACK (cont) (os) (calling): It's Ja-ack ! 

Lili's face is blank. She turns and continues blindly on her way. 

78 INTERIOR VIADUCT DAY 

Jack stares up at Lili's retreating form. 

JACK: It's her. I know it. 

GUMP: Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with. 

JACK: I've got to reach her! 

Jack races off. Gump runs along behind. 

78A INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The shadowy figure of Darkness looms over a band of deformed PYGMIES 
with needle-sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork 
tines. 

DARKNESS: My enemies approach.... destory them! 
Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off. 

79 DELETED 

80 INTERIOR LILI'S VIADUCT DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry out onto the arching span. The Princess is 
nowhere in sight. 

GUMP (running after): Slow down....! 
Use some caution! 

JACK: This way! 

Jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by Lili. Gump 
follows after. 

81 INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

Lili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine-like roots. A 
glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling. Her blank eyes 
stare straight ahead. 

Jack and Gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to 
see the Princess drift out of sight. 

JACK: There she is....! Lili....! 

Jack and Gump run to catch up, pushing through root tendrils agleam 
with rain. Suddenly, they are attacked by SCREAMING Pygmies. 

GUMP: Jack! 

JACK (drawing his sword): Demons! 

The nimble Pygmies leap about them, lethal talons slashing through 
the drizzle. 

Jack and Gump retreat, backing between clingling rootlets. 

GUMP: Quick! In here! 

Gump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck 
inside, slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking Pygmies. 

81A INTERIOR SEALED CORRIDOR DAY 

Jack strains against the door handle, struggling to keep the portal 
shut tight. There is less space than in a closet. The corridor 
behind them is completely bricked over. 

GUMP: Trapped....! 

CLOSE ON DOOR: With great force, the Pygmies' claws stab through the 
thick wood like stiletties. Their needle tips are mere inches from 
Jack and Gump. 

The door's inner surface is studded with talons. Jack suddenly SLAMS 
the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a 
loud CRASH. 

The Pygmies' frenzied SCREAMING ends in abrupt SILENCE. 

Jack and Gump peer cautiously out. 

81B INTERIOR RAIN CORRIDOR DAY 

The Pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door, dangling 
from their imbedded talons. 

JACK: Come on! 

Jack and Gump run into the rain. 

82 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump hurry around the corner just as Lili heads towards a 
pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach. 

JACK (calling): Lili! Wait! 

Gump grabs Jack's arm and yanks him to a stop. 

GUMP: Don't be daft! She's under a spell! 

Lili enters and the doors swing closed behind her. 

83 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

An enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall 
Baroque columns. Winged demons writhe in the shadows above. A long 
black table reaches down the centre of the room. All is lit by 
firelight. The gaping hearth, with its entablature of monumental 
sculpture, is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones, carved in 
a hideous, twisting mass of tendons, sinews and museles. 

When the imposing doors swing closed, Lili's spell is broken. She 
stares in terror at her news surroundings. 

Something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped 
shadows. It is a magnificent high-collared black gown, waltzing like 
a ghost across the black marble floor. There is no one wearing the 
garment! 

Fascinated, Lili watches the dress circle towards her. She finds it 
irresistable. Taking hold of the gown's empty sleeves she begins to 
dance, spinning round and round to the impulsive music. 

84 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors. 

JACK: Why did you stop me? 

GUMP: We best reconnoitre. What if it's 
a trap? 

Gump and Jack strain to see through the crack between the doors. 

85 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili dances by herself, turning slow dreamy circles before the 
blazing fire. She is now WEARING the splendid black gown! 

Reflected firelight GLITTERS in the shadows. An open jewel box 
spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table. Lili is lure 
like a moth to the flame. 

She steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table. The ebony 
casket brims with gemstones. Lili's eyes dazzle. A carved ebony 
figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre, holding in its 
up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind 
can imagine. 

The Princess sucks in her breath. The temptation is too great. She 
impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool. 

The high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and 
without thinking, she backs towards the wall, fumbling behind her 
neck. 

She leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment, 
concentrating on the tricky clasp. All at once, a piece of sculpture 
becomes ANIMATE. Powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace. For 
a moment Lili doesn't notice, grateful for the help. Then, she 
realises what is happening and SCREAMS. 

The musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror. 
Lili turns to run, but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall 
cheval glass mirror. She looks furtively about, making certain she 
is unobserved. Alone, she admires her perfect image. 

CLOSE ON MIRROR: Beneath Lili's pleased expression we see the evil 
face of Darkness APPEAR like a man emerging from under water. 

Darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror. 

Lili backs away, GASPING soundlessly with terror. 

Darkness steps forth through the glass into the room, clad in black 
finery. 

Lili staggers. Darkness reaches to embrace her and the Princess 
SHRIEKS at the top of her lungs. The moment he touches her shoulder, 
she slumps tothe floor, unconscious. 

Darkness stands over the fallen girl, his heartbeat pulsing like 
muffled thunder. Something almost like a smile creases his hideous 
features as he rolls a lock of Lili's hair between his clawed 
fingers. 

The Princess blinks and opens her eyes. She is horrified to find 
Darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away. 

DARKNESS: Do not be afraid, lady.... 

Lili GASPS like a stranded fish. She is catatonic with fear. 

DARKNESS (cont): I mean you no harm. 

Darkness offers the Princess his hand. 

DARKNESS (cont): How like you my gifts...? Does 
the gown not please you? Come.... 
tell me.... 

Lili's terror renders her speechless. 

DARKNESS (cont): The colour is most suitable... We 
sanctify the death of the old world 
and the birth of a new order.... 
You are the guest of honour. 

Lili WEEPS and tugs at the black dress. 

LILI: ....of dishonour...! Take this 
away.... Please! I beg you! 

Darkness advances on Lili. The slow kettldrum THROB of his heart 
underscores his words. 

DARKNESS: Your soul in like some dark nectar.... 
I cannot rest unril I taste its 
sweetness. 

LILI (frantic): Never! I hate you! I hate this 
dress! 

DARKNESS: Can you speak so of your bridal 
gown....? 

LILI (screaming): Nooooooooo! 

86 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Jack and Gump listen by the closed doors to Lili's peircing scream 
(OS). Jack is desparate and half-draws his sword from the scabbard. 

JACK: What has he done to her?

Gump restrains the boy.

GUMP: You have no power to stop it....
Be thankful she lives.

Jack shoves his sword back in disgust.

JACK (bitterly): Some champion....
What good is this fancy sword?

GUMP: It's not the sword that counts, but
the man who swings it....

87 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili slumps to the cold stone floor, WEEPING. Darkness bends 
solicitously over her.

DARKNESS: Why the tears?

LILI (sobbing): ....everything is lost....
poor Jack....

DARKNESS: Why weep for him? He left you
alone to die!

LILI: No! He'd never do that! He was
killed....like everything else....

DARKNESS (glancing over his shoulder): Yes.... But
why mourn? You have a new and grander destiny!

LILI: Consort of some cowardly vile toad
who slinks through the night!

DARKNESS: Not so! I requite to shadow's
solace and dark of the night.... Sunshine is my
destroyer!

LILI (scornful): You think you're so powerful....
and hide in the ground like a mole!

DARKNESS (smiling): This too will change. 
The last unicorn dies tonight....!
As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever. 
There shall never be another dawn!

LILI (horrified): No....! You can't....
You mustn't....

Darkness throws back his evil head and LAUGHS.

88 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 
The demonic LAUGHTER of Darkness carries through the massive doors.

JACK: He means to kill the mare, Gump!

GUMP: Don't mourn the corpse
'til the coffin's in the ground.

DARKNESS (OS): My dominion shall encompass
the enternal night!

GUMP: As long as the sun still shines, 
so does hope!

JACK (bitterly: Sun doesn't shine down here.

Jack fingers Lili's silver medallion hanging around his neck
and from out of the blue, inspiration strikes.

JACK (cont) (grinning): Wait a minute....! I 
think I know a way.

89 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Lili stares at Darkness with terror and loathing.

DARKNESS: The world shall be at last as 
nature intended....a place of chaos and
anarchy!

LILI: You're mad!

DARKNESS: Aye, Lady, and proud to be so! 
For in madness lies the soul of all 
that's noble.... Can you fathom the loneliness
of untold eons lived in darkness? My spirit
was forged in that black fire....

LILI: You live alone because you are
loathsome! The contagion of your wicked heart demands
isolation.

DARKNESS: Nay, mistress. I've found
my mate and you know it. We're just 
alike, you and I. Beneath the skin
we are already one.

LILI: Never!

DARKNESS: 'Twas your sin trapped the unicorn.
Even now, the evil seed of what you've 
done blooms within you!

LILI (shrieking): You lie! You're
repulsive!

DARKNESS (stung by her words): No more so than you!
Can't you sense it? That is why I desire you. 
I need someone to share the dark secrets of my 
soul.

LILI: You....? You disgust me! You're
nothing but a beast!

DARKNESS: Everyone is a beast....only most are
afraid to see it!

Darkness compels Lili over to the mirror with the force of his will.

90 LILI'S POV : MIRROR 

Lili sees her reflection in the glass. The lovely feminine
features ALTER into those of a cat-like beast.

DARKNESS (os): This mirror shows how we really are....
Behold your true reflection.

91 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pulls free from his graps and turns from the glass. Her
face remains lovely and unchanged.

LILI (frantic): No! You're working magic on me!
I won't believe it!

DARKNESS: My Lady misjudges me... I am no
common trickster.... look at
you hands!

Lili's fingers transform before her eyes: hooked claws spring from 
their tips, coarse black hair pushes the skin.

DARKNESS (cont) (Laughing): My mirror
never lies.

Lili's lovely face undergoes the same tranmutation she
witnessed in the mirror. She feels fur-covered sheeks and
pointed ears. This time, her SCREAM is hysterical.

Darkness places a protective arm around Lili.

DARKNESS (cont): Glory in your animal nature.
It is your triumph!

LILI: I'm hideous!

DARKNESS: No! The puling, pallid creature you
were was truly something disgusting.
Now you are magificent.... a fierce goddess!

Lili jerks away, HISSING and showing her claws.

LILI: Damn you!

DARKNESS: We are both of us damned, my Queen.

Darkness bows with mock formality, ALTERING into his own shadows, 
which slides through a crack in the paving stones.

Lili cannot resist her reflection. Horrified anew. she falls to the 
floor, WEEPING.

91A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

Round and red, the great disc of the setting sun slides towards the 
distant horizon.

92 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

Crazed by anxiety, Jack finds the keyhole and cups his hands around 
it.

JACK (calling out): Lili....? Can you
hear me....?

93 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili huddles WEEPING on the cold stones.

JACK (os): ....Lili....?

At the sound of Jack's voice, the Princess looks up with a start.

LILI: ....Jack?

JACK (os): Over here....
By the door....

Lili turns eagerly turns to the door.

LILI: Oh, Jack....dear Jack! Can it
really be you? I was afraid you 
were dead.

93A INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: Thank God you're all right! I didn't
know what to do.... I never want to
lose you again....

93B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili pauses before the keyhole, out of Jack's line of sight.

LILI: Jack, my love....my precious
love! I pray it's you and not more
wicked magic.

93C CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

JACK: It's me, you can be sure of that....
and there's magic on our side, too.

93D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

LILI: It's all my fault....the unicorn....
everything....

JACK (os): My fault as much as yours....
Don't worry. We're here to save you.

LILI (sadly): I'm far past saving,
sweet Jack....

A huge tears wells in Lili's eye and flies out toward the keyhole, 
defying gravity.

94 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY

Lili's tear flies through the keyhole and strikes Jack's face like a 
horizontal raindrop. He touches the spot curiously.

GUMP (amazed): How did you do that?

JACK (to Gump): I didn't do anything....
(into keyhole) let me see your face. 
It will give me hope....

Jack strains to see through the keyhole.


95 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili stares at the keyhole in horror.

JACK (os): ....just to glimpse your smile....

LILI (grief-stricken): No.... I can't....
forget me, Jack....

The Princess reaches out her animal's paw and covers the keyhole.

96 INTERIOR CORRIDOR OUTSIDE GREAT HALL DAY 

As the LIGHT in the opening grows DARK, Jack tenderly places his 
hand next to Lili's.

JACK: Lili....? I love you....

Gump pulls frantically on Jack's arm.

GUMP: Come, Jack. We've no time 
to spare.... Remember your plan?

Sadly, Jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows Gump back 
along the corridor.


97 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Princess Lili lies SOBBING. High above, the winged figures watch 
her. The music THROBS, underscoring a low, rhythmic CHANTING. Like 
some ghastly chorus fro, Hell, the living statuary sings in unison 
to Lili:

STATUARY (singing): Bride of Night.... Bride of Night....
Darkness is your heart's delight!
Hail to Darkness! Hail the Night!
His the Power and the Might!
Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom,
Sing his praises from the tomb!

Lili lifts her head, listening to the sepulchral SINGING. Her eyes 
burn like a tiger's. She bares her fangs, and from her throat issues 
a bone-chilling HOWL.

98 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Screwball and Brown Tom stop short in their tracks when they hear 
the SOUND of a distant HOWL echoes in the shadows. 

SCREWBALL (trembling): I vote we run like hell! 

The two faeries scamper off into darkness. 
99 INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

Gump, Jack and a woman-sized Luna wait outside the kitchen door as 
Brown Tom and Screwball come running up. Gump studies his ornate 
timepiece.

GUMP: Where were you? In another three flicks 
of a badger's tail it'll be half-past.

SCREWBALL: Sorry....time slips away
when you're having so much fun.

BROWN TOM (out of breath): We....found the mare
....chained....in the dungeon below.

Gump shoves his timepiece back in his belt.

GUMP: Excellant.... Who has a bit of
parchment?

The two faeries search in their clothing. Screwball produces a 
plethora of trash: marbles, string, old doll's eyes, coloured bird's 
eggs, ancient coins, etc. At last he finds a crumbled peice of 
sheepskin.

SCREWBALL: Here.... I was saving it
to write me will on.

BROWN TOM: Where there's a will there's
a....

GUMP: Shush, both of you....! Jack has a 
plan....a good one....

Gump squats on the floor, and, using a triangle and some charcoal, 
divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles.

GUMP (mumbling): ....angle of refraction equals....
angle of incidence....multiplied by a 
factor of fourty.....divided by the
square root of a google-plex....

Gump SNAPS his fingers triumphantly.

GUMP (cont): Perfect! It will work like a charm, Jack!

JACK: Let's get started! What we need to 
do is sneak back into the kitchen and 
gather all the plates and 
platters....

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! Seen enough
of that kitchen, I have!

BROWN TOM: Don't be so pig-headed! 
You can trust Gump.

SCREWBALL: I'd sooner trust a rat 
in the ghetto!

BROWN TOM: Well.... trust Jack then.

Jack eases open the kitchen door.

JACK: Remember....just the shiny ones....

Jack leads the way back into the kitcheb. Gump urges the other two 
to follow.

GUMP: ....and be quiet! Soft as
thistledown, that's the faerie way.

100 INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

Jack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen.

Both Demon Cooks are asleep, the encountered first is stretched out 
across his chopping block, SNORING like a dragon with indisgestion.

The unfortunate Blunder turns slowly over the coals, hog-tied to a 
spit. A bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth. Jack and Gump rush 
to his side.

Gump pulls the apple from Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER (frantic): Get me outta here! Please!
While I'm still medium rare!

GUMP: Quiet....! You're a free imp
on one condition....

BLUNDER(very loud): Condition....! What condition?
Loose me or I'll make such....

Gump shoves the apple back into Blunder's mouth, stoppering his loud 
complaint.

GUMP: Any more noise and you're
shish-ka-bob....

Blunder nods eagerly.

GUMP (cont): You do what we tell you....
understand?

More eager nodding from Blunder.

GUMP (cont): Swear it!

Gump pulls the apple out of Blunder's mouth.

BLUNDER: I swear! On the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

Jack cuts Blunder's bonds and the little imp hops nibmly out of the 
fireplace.

BLUNDER: A thousand thanks....

Jack boosts Gump and Screwball up onto the mantle where the polished 
plates are stacked.

JACK: Up we go!

Luna TRANSFORMS into a dot of LIGHT and flies up to the cimnet 
pieces, REMATERIALISING there in her full size.

JACK (cont): Your turn, Blunder.

Jack lifts Blunder onto his shoulds so he can climb to the first 
level of the three-tiered mantle. Blunder joins Screwball, Gump and 
Luna as they rush about the mantlepiece, frantically gathering 
shield-sized plates.

One by one, the faeries toss the plates down to Jack, who stacks 
them in Brown Tom's arms.

Brown Tom staggers through the kitchen carrying a teetering tower of 
plates. He can't see where he is going and trips over the nozzle of 
the giant bellows.

The plates fall with a deafening CRASH!

Both ferocious blind Cooks are awakened by the NOISE.

SECOND COOK: Huh....! Wuzzat?

Jack and the faeries freeze in place as the Cook rises and pulls his 
huge cleaver from the chopping block.

COOK (sniffing the air): Meat....! Me
smells fresh meat!

Jack draws his sword and steps between the awesome Cook and Brown 
Tom, sprawled helplessly on the floor.

SECOND COOK: Find meat!

JACK: Over here!

The blind cook lunges for Jack. He wields his deadly cleaver with 
amazing accuracy for one without sight.

COOK: Chop it up!

Jack ducks past the Cook, smacking him on the leg with the flat of 
his blade. The huge demon YELPS in pain.

The Second Cook picks up a skillet, wielding it like a club.

SECOND COOK: Smash....! Me smash!

Jack is caught between the two demon Cooks. He cannot face one 
without turning his back on the other.

Gump sees Jack's predicament and leaps from the mantle onto the 
Second Cook's head with a wild CRY:

GUMP: Schweinhundt!

Gump clings to the Second Cook like a terrier, confusing him and 
giving Jack time to dart acrobatically out of the way.

JACK (jabbing the Cook): Gotcha!

COOK: Cut you in half!

A mighty swing from the Cook misses Jack, who executes a nimble 
back-flip. The Cook cleaves through a hanging side of meat by 
mistake.

The Second Cook grabs hold of Gump and shakes him.

SECOND COOK: Sweet, sweet blood....

Up on the mantle, Screwball and Blunder exchange a helpless look. 
Gump is a goner unless they do something. They a simultaneous 
unspoken conclusion, and leap onto the Second Cook's back.

SCREWBALL (calling out): Rooster toes....!

BLUNDER (calling out): ....pig whiskers!

Faced with this new twin threat, the Second Cook drops GUmp, who 
immediately bities him on the leg.

SECOND COOK: Whut.....! Who now? Ouch!

Jack fights a rearguard action, stabbing at the savage Cook as he 
retreats.

JACK: Best you can do?

COOK: You gonna be mince-meat!

Jack back onto a steep stone ramp against the far wall.

JACK: Got to catch me first!

The Cook's cleaver CLANGS against the ramp, missing Jack by inches.

The Second Cook has his hands full. Brown Tom has joined the fray 
and clings to his other leg while Blunder and Screwball claw and 
punch at his head.

SCREWBALL & BLUNDER: Hit him....!
Sock him....!

Staggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught, the Second 
Cook lurches in circles.

SECOND COOK: Kill....! Smash....!

Furious, the Second Cook swings his heavy skillet at Screwball and 
Blunder. He misses them completely, hitting himself square on the 
head and knocking himself out.

The faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the 
fireplace.

GUMP: We must help Jack!

The faeries race to the foot of the ramp. Jack parries the Cook's 
fearsome swing. The Cook presses him relentlessly. The CLASH of 
steel rings through the cavernous kitchen.

The faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section.

BLUNDER: Stick him a good one!

SCREWBALL: Cut him down to size, Jack!

Giant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp. The Cook back 
Jack against them. There is no further room for retreat.

COOK: Gonna spill your guts, boy.

The Cook swings his cleaver from the hip. Jack nimbly springs out of 
harm's way. The cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks 
supporting the pyramid of wine barrels.

GRUMBLING, the Cook yanks his cleaver free. This pulls the chock 
loose from under the bottom barrel.

COOK (cont) (Listening): Wuzzat....?

The entire stack of barrels shifts, rolling towards the Cook.

COOK (cont): Bad news!

The Cook runs for his life. The huge hogshead RUMBLE forward in a 
wooden avalanche.

Jack crouches at the top of the ramp. As the Cook runs past he 
sticks the sword-blade between his legs and trips him up.

The Cook tumbles, head over heels, down the ramp.

Half-way up, the faerie band sees the giant barrels ROLLING towards 
them.

SCREWBALL (horrified): Sodom and Glockamora!

The faeries turn and run.

The barrels CRASH on top of the fallen Cook, knocking him senseless 
as they CONTINUE rolling.

The faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen 
doorway at the bottom of the ramp.

The barrels CRUNCH into the kitchen wall. Because they are larger 
than the doorway, the faeries crouching inside are spared.

Oceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave, forcing the door and 
washing the little people into the corridor beyond.

101 INTERIOR KITCHEB CORRIDOR DAY 

Brown Tom is beside himself with delight. He scoops up wine with 
Screwball's helmet and pours it on top of his head..

BROWN TOM: Whoopeeeeeee!

Jack appears in the shattered doorway, sword in hand.

JACK: Hate to break up the
party, but there's work to be
done!

Gump jumps to his feet.

GUMP: Hurry! Get those plates~

Jack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen.

Screwball and Blunder follow, but Brown Tom lingers behind, scooping 
the helmet full of wine.

BROWN TOM: Just a wee taste....

Gump kicks Brown Tom smartly in the pants.

GUMP: Move! Or I make your head ring
worse than any hangover!

Gump chases Brown Tom back into the kitchen.

101A INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The faeries gather up the fallen plates. Jack stares thoughtfully at 
the fireplace, where the body of the Second Cook has snuffed out the 
flames.

GUMP: What's on your mind, Jack?

JACK: Smoke rising.... That chimney
must go clear to the top.

Gump peers into the hearth.

GUMP: Not much to hold onto. Take a 
peapod pixie to make the climb.

Screwball steps proudly forward.

SCREWBALL: I'll do it!

The faeries are astonished. Screwball never volunteers.

GUMP: What? Can I believe my ears?

SCREWBALL: Don't see why not. Ain't 
I small enough for the job?

BLUNDER (proudly): No job's too
small for the Buttercup brothers....

SCREWBALL (on his knees: Please, Gump.... let me try.
I know I'm always trouble, but I want
to make it up to you....
Prove that I won't let you down.

BROWN TOM: Be sure ya don't fall down!

GUMP: All right! Do it! But be swift.

SCREWBALL: Thank you....thank you....
You'll never regret it....

Jack boosts Screwball up into the chimney.

JACK: I'm proud of you, Screwball.
(handing him a plate)
Don't drop it....

GUMP (calling up): We'll send Luna with 
a signal when all is ready.

101B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball clings to the smoke-blackened bricks, staring up the 
nearly endless shaft at a small circle of light far above.

BROWN TOM (os) (calling from below): Always
knew you'd be going places, Screwball....
Good luck....!

SCREWBALL (to himself): I'm goin' places,
all right.... straight to the top and on
outta this hell-hole.... No more
kitchen....no more demons.... Just the 
easy life for Screwball Buttercup....

101C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 
A shining gold plate is propper on the Secnd Cook smouldering in the 
fireplace.

Luna positions another plate against the bellows, taking care to get 
the angle right.

Gump stands between the bellows and the shattered kitchen door, 
measuring the nagle with a curious hand-held instrument.

GUMP: Little more to the left, Luna....
that's better..just a touch more....
perfect.

101D INTERIOR KITCHEN CORRIDOR DAY 

Blunder and Brown Tom run off carrying armloads of plates.

Jack leans a platter against the corridor wall, adjsuting it 
precisely.

JACK (calling): How's that, Gump?

GUMP (os): Dead centre....!

102 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili's tears have dried. She prowls the majestic hall with regal 
dignity. Something magic occurs at the baquet table: each crystal 
goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes; every empty 
bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things to 
eat-all of it black!

The food is beautiful in spite on its colour. Lili stares a it with 
undisguised hunger. Some animal instinct warns her not to trust this 
gleaming ebony feast, but she's famished and snatches up an apple 
bright as ploish anthracite.

DARKNESS (os): Good....eat....

Lili GASPS, dropping the apple. Darkness sits in one of the twin 
grostesque thrones flanking the hearth.

DARKNESS (cont): The food is for your enjoyment.

LILI: I don't want it! I'm
not hungry!

DARKNESS: Do you lie just to please me?

LILI: I do nothing for your pleasure!

Darkness gestures to the opposing throne.

DARKNESS: You are so like a child, milady.
Sit, and we'll talk.

Lili makes no move towards the chair. 

DARKNESS (CONT) (gently): Like a 
child, you expect anger and
defiance will upset me.... These
are the qualities I admire most....

Lili snarls, fangs gleaming in the firelight.

LILI: So.... I'd love to rip out your
throat, yet it would pain you more
if I licked your hand....

DARKNESS: All I desire is that you
sit in that chair and talk with me.

Lili approaches the grotesque throne. Like some impossible organism, 
it pulses in anticipation.

LILI: Sit....? Here....?

DARKNESS: Yes. Please....

LILI: I prefer to stand.

For a moment, Darkness nearly sucumbs to anger. The viens in his 
forehead throb. His talons grip his throne in a spam of fury.

DARKNESS (snarling): Sit....!

Darkness shrewdly realises rage won't work and he relaxes with a 
twisted smile.

DARKNESS: (cont): .....or stand. As 
you wish.... It's enough that we're
alone together.... just the two of
us....

102A CLOSE: MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE 

Across the Great Hall from the blazing hearth is an identical 
fireplace. This one is cold, but not empty. Covered with soot and as 
black as a Moor, Screwball climbs into VIEW between the massive 
andirons.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): All of time
awaits us....why not make a start.

Screwball puts down his plate and tiptoes into the Great Hall 
towards the banqueting table.

LILI (os): A start at what....?

102B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Darkness leans forward in his throne, smiling at Lili.

DARKNESS: Simple conversation....

LILI: What do we possibly have to
talk about?

DARKNESS: Thoughts....dreams....
ambitions....

LILI: I have no interest in your
foul ambition.

DARKNESS: Desire then....surely we 
beasts all have desire.

102C INTERIOR GREAT HALL (MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE) DAY

Unseen, Screwball climbs up onto the banquet table. He can't believe 
his good fortune. A bounteous feast surrounds him.

LILI (os): You'd never dream what 
I desire....

DARKNESS (os): Don't be so sure....
Dreams are my speciality

Screwballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit. He rushes about, 
treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by 
such plenty.

DARKNESS (cont) (os): It is through
dreams I influence mankind. I have 
dreams of my own.... dreams of enternity
with you....no more silence....no
more loneliness....

102D INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Lili LAUGHS in the face of Darkness.

LILI (scornfully): Such drivel! You
sound like some simpering schoolboy!

DARKNESS: I'll wager there was a 
time when the attention of a 
devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to
your liking.

Lili regards her claws with a savage sneer.

LILI (snarling): I know what I'd do
with such meat now!

DARKNESS: ....all things change, lady.
The pleasures of youth become the
regrets of maturity....

A loud CRASH on the banquet table causes Darkness to look around. He 
SEES Screwball standing by the centrepiece, about to shove a whole 
chicken in his mouth.

DARKNESS (cont) (angry): What're
you doing here?

Blackened with soot, Screwball easily passes for a goblin.

SCREWBALL (all innocence): .....am
I early....?

DARKNESS: You impudent imp!

SCREWBALL: I thought the invitation
said half-past....

DARKNESS (roaring): GET OUT!

Screwball gets the message. He drops the chicken and hops down off 
the banquet table, running to the opposite fireplace for all he's 
worth.

DARKNESS (cont) (gently to Lili): Sit....
I value your thoughts. Why not share them
with me?

Lili looks at the grotesque throne.

LILI: No more than that....just sit?

DARKNESS (nodding): Sit....

Lili steps up onto the oversized footstool. Inches behind her, the 
monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature, the 
powerful sinews rippling with desire.

LILI (a feline smile): Doesn't
seem such an outrageous request....

The Princess prepares to sit, her luscious, silk-swathed bottom only 
inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne.

DARKNESS: You'll never regret granting
me this favour....

Lili's eyes glitter as she teases him.

LILI: What shall we talk about?

DARKNESS (impatient): Just sit!

The febric of Lili's gown brushes the writihing throne. In another 
second she will be sitting. Unexpectedly, she stands up tall on the 
footstool.

LILI: Such a disagreeable chair....must
be terribly uncomfortable. I think 
I'll stand if you don't mind.

Darkness barely controls his raging anger.

DARKNESS: I prefer you to sit!

LILI: I'd rather stand, thank you.

Darkness's forehead swells with fury.

DARKNESS: Sit!

LILI: No.... Not now....

Darkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy, rising up to tower over 
Lili.

DARKNESS (roaring): I command you to sit!

Lili is utterly unafraid. She LAUGHS at the swollen image of 
Darkness.

LILI: Don't be silly.

Lili hops down from the footstool.

DARKNESS (screaming with rage): SIT, DAMN YOU!

Lili sashays past him, twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton 
fashion. Her hearty LAUGH is as loud as the outraged ROARS of 
Darkness.

LILI (laughing): Never.... never....

110A INTERIOR DUNGEON CHASM DAY 
Jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to Brown 
Tom waiting on the viaduct above.

Jack hurls another plate.

Suddenly, the Winged Monster, hatched from the walking Egg, glides 
SHRIEKING from the shadows. It catches the plate in its saw-toothed 
beak and dives at Jack. Gump sees it first.

GUMP: Jack....!

Dropping the plate, the Winged Monster rips at Jack. The Green Man 
draws his sword and defends himself. The fight is savage and brief. 
Jack hacks the Monster out of the air. It lies, flapping and broken 
at his feet. Gump touches him sympathetically on the arm.

JACK: ....I'm all right....Let's
get on....to the dungeon....

GUMP (pensive): You have power 
within I never imagined. 

111 INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

Darkness stares at the Princess in a towering rage. She 
flirtatiously pretends to be interested in a bit of fruit before 
rejecting it in favour of another, which also proves not to her 
liking.

DARKNESS: I'm not above my own little
pranks, milady.... Should you have
a taste for them.

LILI: No doubt they're as foul as
the stuff you set on your table....

Darkness relaxes, taking his cue from Lili's mocking tone.

DARKNESS: Foul....or fair, such distinctions
are entirely arbitrary, my dear.... Does
not the lowly toad think his mate fair, 
warts and all....?

LILI: Do you suggest I will think 
you fair some day?

DARKNESS: In time....and time we surely
have... stretching before us....
infinity....like a merciful curtain closing
off the past....

Darkness moves gracefully to Lili's side and kneels before her.

DARKNESS (cont): I beseech you...do not reject
my foods as you do my food.... Never have I
abased myself so before another....It is not
humility that brings me low, mistress.... but
love....

LILI: Love?

DARKNESS: Aye, love.... You think my
heart a barren desert where only
hate can flower....A much finer blossom
show its petals now....nourished by
sorrow....watered with your tears...
(baring his breast)
I offer you this rose, Princess!
....my heart....my soul....

Lili is astonished. She walks away to consider what Darkness
has said.

Darkness watches her slyly. His expression reveals his words
to have been a ruse. He gloats in anticipation.

Lili turns back to face him. Darkness immediately resumes his look 
of adoration.

LILI: You dizzy me, lord.... I never
thought to hear the word 'love' 
spoken again....

DARKNESS: You'll hear it forever.
(shouting)
I love you!

LILI: If such is true....hope 
is yet alive...
(regarding her claws)
These talons can caress as well as kill....

They are interrupted by the SOUND of a CHIME. An unseen clocks tolls 
the hour.

Darkness stares up into the shadows.

DARKNESS: It grows late....

111A EXTERIOR SKY DAY 

The setting sun blazes through distant drifting clouds, tinting the 
sky in a riot of colours. Another CHIME is heard.

111B INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY 

The SOUND of the unicorn's frightened whinny carries up from the 
dungeons below.

DARKNESS (laughing): Our wedding
feast is in good voice....Think
you not?

Lili cunningly disguises her alarm.

LILI: I admire your thrift, my lord,
both the meal and entertainment
in a single dish.

Darkness appreciates this joke.

DARKNESS: Are you anxious to see blood flow?

LILI: As you are to drink it!
(smiling slyly)
Will the groom grant his bride her wish
on this night?

DARKNESS (beaming with pleasure): 
You have but to ask my savage beauty.

Lili leers, baring her feline teeth.

LILI: I want to kill the unicorn!

Darkness claps his hands with joy.

DARKNESS: Lady, you make me proud....

111C INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY 

Screwball struggles up the endless chimney, past hideous gargoyles 
and ancient skeletons imbedded in the blackened bricks.

The SOUNDS of conversation CARRY UP from below.

LILI (OS): I will do it with joy....!
Let the unicorn's blood anoint our love!

SCREWBALL: Crumpets and candlesticks....!
She's gonna kill it!

LILI (OS): ....and in the eternity
awaiting us, I will happily sit on your throne
as befits the Queen of Darkness!

SCREWBALL: I can't let that happen....Why,
it's not civilized!

Clutching the golden plate, Screwball struggles upwards like
a tiny mountaineer.

He reaches into a grinning skull for a handhold and the jaws
clamp shut on his fingers.

SCREWBALL (cont): Billygoat dumplings!

Screwball yanks his hand free, nearly losing his balance. His terror 
gives him renewed energy and he scrambles frantically up the inside 
of the chimney.

111D EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY 

The chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon. Black as a sweep, 
Screwball emerges at the top and looks around.

The distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of 
dark mountains. We HEAR the SOUND of a clock CHIME!

111E INTERIOR DUNGEON CORRIDOR DAY 

A distant CHIME stops Gump in his tracks. He pulls out his timepiece 
from the pouch and studies it.

GUMP: ....not much time....

111F INTERIOR GREAT HALL DAY

Princess Lili stretches out her arms towards Darkness.

LILI: Bring me to the wretched beast.

Darkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth.

The unicorn's distant whinny ECHOES from below.

DARKNESS: This way, fair beauty. I hear a 
throat begging to be cut.

Lili hesitates when she realises Darkness intends to lead
her straight into the flames.

LILI (fearful): No....! It's impossible!

Darkness steps into the leaping flames. He turns and takes
Lili's hand.

DARKNESS: Now you are my queen. Nothing is
impossible....Come....it takes but a 
single step....Find the faith....

Darkness looks deep into Lili's eyes. She places her tiny
foot among the white glowing coals. Nothing happens. Not
even the fur is singed.

Lili smiles. Her fear vanishes. She stands at the side of her 
master. Darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are 
consumed by flames, becoming one with the blaze around them.

113 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Unseen by the deformed goblin GUARDS, the faeries creep out of the 
shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column.

Jack positions Blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate 
before joining the others.

JACK: Everything's ready....

GUMP: And you, Jack? Your greatest
challenge is still to come....

Darkness and Princess Lili emerge, arm in arm, out of a background 
curtain of fire. They sweep majestically down the stone steps to 
where the unicorn is chained.

Silent as mice, Jack and the faeries peer around at them. Jack is 
horrified by Lili's bestial appearance. 
JACK: ....oh, God....! Lili....

GUMP: Judge her with your heart, not
your eyes.

Blix and Poxand the other goblin Guards scramble to attention as the 
regal pair ascends.

BLIX: Greetings....

POX: S-s-s-salutations....

DARKNESS: Silence....! Prepare the unicorn 
for sacrafice!

The goblins hurry to comply. Blix selects a grotesque black 
greatsword from among a rack of weapons.

Pox furiously pedals a grindstone. Blix applies the blade. Showers 
of sparks shower onto the glistening floor.

Behind the column, the watching faeries are desparate. Luna's 
glowing LIGHT hovers above their heads.

BROWN TOM: The game is lost....for all
of Jack's pretty plan...
. 
JACK: No! It'll work! It must!

GUMP: Luna! Fly up to Screwball! Tell
him it's time!

Quick as a FLASH, Luna STREAKS off into the shadows.

Blix carries the sharpened greatsword to Darkness, offering it with 
a low bow.

DARKNESS: Excellent.... Let the ritual
begin....

The demon Guards stand in a semi-circle around the unicorn. Blix and 
Pox open tattered black prayer books. Darkness steps to a twisted 
lectern and READS from a sinister volume.

DARKNESS: In the beginning, there was
nothing....a void of darkness, a cold
enternity of silence....

POX: Endless night, black as death!
Mother of Shadows protect us!

The assembled Guards answer in a ghastly CHORUS:

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Mother of Shadows, renew us!

POX: Dream Sister....eclipse our pain!

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Night Bride....restore our strength!

114 INTERIOR KEEP AND CORRIDORS DAY

Luna BLAZES straight up out of the abysmal keep; a tiny shooting 
star. The demons' ceremony continues (OS):

DARKNESS (OS): ....and when the perfect void
was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was
heard and all the brethern fled in terror....

Luna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (OS): Deliver us, O' 
Darkness, from all fear....

115 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Darkness steps forward. His booming VOICE disturbs the sleeping abts 
and sends them wheeling in clouds around his head.

DARKNESS: Hear me, ye Powers of the Night! We
offer this sacrafive in honour of you....

Darkness reaches up and seizes a fluttering bat from out of the air.

DARKNESS (cont): Here is our offering....
sanctified with blood....

Darkness crushes the bat to a pulp and splatters the unicorn's white 
flank with its blood. Darkness struggles mentally with the mare.

DARKNESS (cont): ....and with fire!

Darkness touches his fingertip to the unicorn's haunch. The hide 
smoulders instantly, leaving an ugly brand.

CHORUS OF GUARDS: Blood and fire, born of Night....
Blood and fire, drown the Light!

The unicorn rears back. Her hooves CLATTER on the cold
stones.

DARKNESS: I pray you, Father, accept my 
sacrafice....Let Light be orever extinguished!
Let the Age of Darkness begin!

Darkness contorts with the strain on imposing his will on the 
unicorn. He dominates the mare and she grows calm.

As the Demon Guards CHANT, Blix and Pox strain at the winch. They 
drag the unicorns towards the chopping block.

116A EXTERIOR TOP OF CHIMNEY DAY

Screwball stands watching the sunset. One hands holds the plate, the 
other polishes a black apple on his tunic.

SCREWBALL (singing under his breath):
....nickety-nackety....noo-noo-noo....

The apple is bright as obsidian. Screwball smiles at his reflection 
on its gleaming surface.

SCREWBALL (cont) (singing): ....fiddle-
dee-widdle-dee....

Screwball takes a big bite of the apple.

Screwball grins, chewing happily. Not a care in the world.

It hits him like a stroke. His eyes cross and he toppes, dropping 
the plate.

Luna comes BLASTING out of the chimney like a tracer bullet.

LUNA (tiny voice): Screwball!

Screwball falls onto the rim of the chimney.

In a brilliant BURST OF LIGHT, Luna materialises into her grown 
self, catching the plate an instant before it drops over the edge.

LUNA (cont): Do it!

Luna looks sadly down on Screwball, touching him with her toe.

LUNA (cont): Screwball...wake up!

Screwball SNORES loudly.

LUNA (cont): Oh, Screwball....

Luna aims the golden plate at the ruby BLAZE of the setting
sun. She aims a beam of LIGHT straight down the chimney.

116B INTERIOR CHIMNEY DAY

The beam of LIGHT descends the dark shaft like a golden waterfall. 

116C INTERIOR KITCHEN DAY 

The beam of LIGHT moves like a searchlight inside the fireplace, 
criss-crossing the Second Cook's body as it misses the propped plate 
he holds by inches.

117 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY

Working together, the two goblins turn the iron winch. Bit by bit, 
the cable is drawn forward onto the drum.

The unicorn's neck is stretched across the block.

Darkness stands before Lili, offering the greatsword.

DARKNESS: Once your hands were too delicate
for such a task....spinning and weaving 
were more their work....

LILI: Let my loom be made of flesh and blood....
I am sister to the Fates!

Lili eagerly seizes the sword.

DARKNESS: What a queen you'll make!

Jack slumps against the wall, desparate.

JACK: Come on, Screwball....

GUMP: She means to do it, Jack!
She's one of them!

Jack stares at Lili.

Gump grabs a long black bow from a weapon rack, and an arrow from a 
quiver beside it.

GUMP (cont): I'm going to stop her!

JACK: Gump, wait! I trust her!

Gump fits an arrow onto the bowstring.

The unicorn is helpless before Lili. Blix locks the winch, securing 
the cable.

DARKNESS: My lady, the birth of a new
world awaits your stroke.

Lili swings the greatsword high over head.

CHORUS OF GUARDS (chanting):
Blood and fire....eternal ice!
Blood and fire....and sacrafice....

Gump draws back the arrow in the longbow, aiming at Lili.

JACK: No....! Don't...!

Jack grabs the bow. He and Gump struggle for the weapon.

The beam of LIGHT ZOOMS out of the corridor, strikes the plate on 
the viaduct, and REFLECTS down into the lowest depths of the castle.

121 INTERIOR DUNGEON DAY 

Gump is determined to shoot Lili. Jack, equally determined to stop 
him.

JACK: I trust her, Gump....I'll
always trust her....

GUMP: Foolish, mortal!

The beam of LIGHT STREAMS in through the corridor. Blunder REFLECTS 
it off his plate towards the others.

Struggling for the bow, Jack and Gump kick over the propped shielf 
the moment the LIGHT beam reaches it.

BROWN TOM: Stop lads....! The light!

A wild LAUGH bursts from Lili's throat. She swings the sword with 
all her might.

The blade arcs through the air, a glittering SUNBURST where it 
carves through the deflected beam of LIGHT.

Lili aims not for the mare, but for the line restraning her. The 
sword severs the woven cable.

LILI (exultant): Run! You're free....!

The unicorn plunges into the shadows. Only the ECHO of her hoofbeats 
remain.

Jack and Gump stop struggling. Jack dives for his fallen shield.

Darkness pulls a weapon from his belt. It is the stallion's alicorn 
mounted as a shortsword.

DARKNESS (sneering savagely): Innocence!

Huge and terrible, Darkness lunges for Lili, driving the alicorn 
straight through her side.

Lili is pierced by the horn. She GASPS, supported by the Demon's 
hold on the blade.

Miraculously, Lili's features alter and TRANSFORM. The fangs and 
claws disappear. Her fur melts like the morning dew. She is an 
innocent maiden once more.

Lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground.

Jack holds his shield in the beam of LIGHT, angling in a bright 
swath towards Darkness.

JACK: Burn....! You evil bastard....

The LIGHT hits Darkness like an express train. He HOWLS, blasted in 
a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon.

Darkness cowers on his knees, SCREAMING in the LIGHT.

All the goblins scatter HOWLING from the LIGHT. 

Brown Tom capers a happy two-step around Gump, who stares straight 
up into the central keep.

BROWN TOM: ....and we'll dance on the 
black devil's grave....

GUMP'S POV : LOOKING UP: The beam of LIGHT dims and goes
out.

BROWN TOM (OS): What's wrong....? What's
happening, Gump?

Gump shrugs, looking sadly at Jack and the darkened shield
he holds.

GUMP (sadly): Sunset....

With a savage SNARL, Darkness staggers off into the gloon, trailing 
trendrils of smoke.

Jack drops the shield and rushes to Lili's side. He kneels and 
cradles her in his arms.

Throwing back his head, Jack HOWLS like a wild animal. His CRY is a 
wolf-wail of utter despair.

Gump runs frantically up to grieving Green Man.

GUMP: No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare!

Gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword.

GUMP (cont): The world needs a champion!

Use this against him!

backdrop of comets and stars.

126A INTERIOR TUNNEL NIGHT 

CLOSE ON: The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along 
the unicorn's track. 

PULL BACK to show Darkness TRANSFORMED into a muscular black unicorn 
stallion. He surges onward, an explosion of strength. FLAMES flare 
from his nostrils.

126B EXTERIOR EDGE OF THE WORLD DAY 

The huge black unciron THUNDERS out of the cavern-mouth.

The mare stand alone, trapped on a final promontory.

The black stallion REARS and charges the mare....

Black and terrible, the devil stallion rises over the mare, striking 
out with his fearsome hooves.

The mare staggers before this onslaught of evil, falling to the 
ground amid flying black feet.

The black stallion paws the ground, preparing to ram his alicorn 
into the fallen mare.

Jack runs out from the dark cavern, gripping the evil greatsword 
with both hands. He sees the stallion tower above the mare

JACK (calling out): Darkness....!
You rotten filth!

The superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge. He 
SNORTS, breathing fire, and lowers his head, charging straight at 
Jack.

Jack stands his ground, greatsword poised, as the huge black 
stallion gallops towards him, hooves striking SPARK.

Jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn ROARS
slavering past.

The greatsword passes straight through the black beast, as if it 
were striking a ghost.

Jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge, but he 
manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes 
again.

The black unicorn's red eyes BLAZE as he crashes into Jack.

The Green Man is thrown awkwardly to one side. He loses the 
greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground.

Dazed, Jack rises on his elbows.. He sees the black hooves of 
Darkness standing before him.

Looking up, Jack sees the Lord of Darkness TRANSFORMED back to his 
original form. He holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the 
boy's heart.

DARKNESS: Always a pleasure to take a 
brave man's life. 

Darkness thrusts down with the alicorn, but Jack rolls skillfully 
aside and counds to his feet.

JACK: ....haven't killed me yet....

Jack draws his own sword and swings at Darkness, who parries with 
the alicorn. SPARKS fly.

Jack swings again. Darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and 
holds Jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze.

DARKNESS: ....Oh, but I have...

Jack is speechless with horror.

DARKNESS (cont): Don't you know me, boy,
don't you know from whence I come....

The muscle hump behind Darkness's neck bulges and cracks. It bursts 
open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold. Jack's horror is 
complete.

DARKNESS (cont): Time to die....

Darkness drives the alicorn sword into Jack's chest, running him 
through.

Jack's eyes are wide with astonishment. Is this what it's like to 
die?

Darkness pulls the alicorn out of Jack. There is no blood! No trace 
of a wound remains on his flesh. Jack blinks in wordless amazement.

DARKNESS (cont): So...! I should have
known....We're just the same! You're
immortal, Jack!

JACK (disbelieving): No....! I'm not!
I'm human....

DARKNESS (laughing): Who was your mother?

JACK (confused): I....don't know....

DARKNESS: Who was your father?

JACK: ....I....can't remember....

DARKNESS: How long have you lived in 
the forest?

JACK: All my life....! I...I....
know who I am....

DARKNESS: You pitiful fool! An immortal
all this time and never knew....
(laughing)
Don't you see, Jack? Don't you understand
your power....! Together we could rule 
the universe!

JACK (bewildered): .....together....?

DARKNESS: There'd be nothing to stop us!
No power could stand in our way! We're
just the same, Jack....You and I.....
eternal....!

Jack struggles to understand the immensity of this
revelation. He wavers in the face of the demon's persuasiveness.

All at once, the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows, white and 
pure.

She spears Darkness straight his mid-section. The evil Lord SCREAMS, 
staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest.

DARKNESS (cont): ....Father....! Protect me....

Darkness starts to shrink. The mare lifts the writhing demon high in 
the air, impaled like a kicking insect.

Rearing, the unicorn arches her neck and tosses Darkness over toe 
edge into the abyss.

Darkness tumbles into the haze. His final HOWL is a lament from the 
depths of Hell.

At the last moment, the falling figure of Darkness TRANSFORMS into 
the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows.

Jack picks up the alicorn. He wraps his other arm around the 
unicorn's neck. They stand together at the edge of the world, united 
in a victorious embrace.

126C EXTERIOR MOUTH OF CAVERN NIGHT 

The faeries gather at the entrance. Screwball is there, half asleep. 
Luna is full-sized. Pale and sleeping, Lili lies on the black cloak. 
The faeries stand around her, eyes downcast.

Jack rides up, mounted on the unicorn. Surrounded by light, he is 
more than a champion. He is divine. The faeries are delighted.

GUMP: Why....Jack....solved 
your riddle at last....

BROWN TOM: Should've known no 
mortal could speak unicorn 
like that....

JACK: How is Lili?

GUMP: Sadly beyond the help of faerie
magic. She's under a powerful spell....
It's like a riddle....

Jack understands. He brightens into a smile.

JAC: I know the answer....! Lift
her to me, gently....

Jack hands Gump the alicorn as the faeries gather Lili in their 
arms, lifting her above their heads.

Jack carefully pulls the enchanted Princess in front of him across 
the unicorn's withers.

JACK (cont): We'll meet again, dear friends....

Jack touches his heels to the unicorn's flanks and they
gallop off in a CLATTER of hoofbeats.

GUMP (waving): Ride like the wind,
Jack....

BROWN TOM: Wish we could go with him....

GUMP: And why not? I know some magic
words that'll do the trick!

SCREWBALL: Oh no! Not me! I hate to travel
like that....makes me sick.

GUMP: Stand back....! The sky's the

SCREWBALL: Can't stand your bumpy

Abruptly, Screwball SHOOTS into the air, flying out of
sight.

GUMP: Screwball! Wait for the spell....

SCREWBALL (os): ....I never do....

Gump gestures magically.

GUMP: Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff....

All at once, Gump, Blunder, and Brown Tom STREAK off into space. 
Luna watches them go. TRANSFORMING into a dot of LIGHT, she speeds 
up after them.

127 EXTERIOR FOREST (RIDE MONTAGE) NIGHT 

Jack clings to Lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight

127A EXTERIOR SKY NIGHT 

The full moon hangs above like the lantern of God as the faeries 
tumble through the clear night sky. Gump rides the alicorn like a 
broomstick.

Far below, magically white and fluid as free-roving moonbeam, the 
unicorn carries her passengers across the nocturnal forest with the 
ease of a dreamer transported through time.

128 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 
It is not yet sun-up. The first faint trace of the false dawn tints 
the eastern horizon. Everywhere, the snow is melting. It is like 
springtime, with bold patches of green showing through the frozen 
landscape.

A bright beam of LIGHT APPROACHES, weaving between the giant trees. 
It is Jack and Lili, mounted on the unicorn.

Jack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides 
easily to the ground with Lili in his arms.

The unicorn doesn't move. She stands watching as Jack gently rests 
Lili down on the mossy earth.

Jack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the 
promontory. He dives gracefully into the pond.

128A EXTERIOR FOREST DAY 

Screwball in the lead, the faeries CRASH down through the trees, 
bouncing to a stop on the forest floor.

SCREWBALL: Ow!

BROWN TOM: Ouch!

GUMP (cheerfully): Home again!

The bedraggled faeries scowl at Gump.

129 EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack streaks down, streaming air bubbles like a comet's tail.

129A EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

The faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion. His alicorn 
has been restored. Wreathed in flowers, it stands majestically out 
from his forehead.

129B EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack strokes deeper and deeper into the pond, past undulating weeds 
and curious fish.

129C EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Faeries are all about, dancing and SINGING around the statuesque 
unicorn. They pelt one another with petals. The mare stands demurely 
to one side, draped in blossoms.

129D EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

At the bottom, Jack moves carefully, trying not to stir up the muck. 
He gently parts the drifting trendrils, searching among the water 
weeds.

129E EXTERIOR TREETOP DAY 

High above the faerie celebration, beautiful MUSIC is HEARD. It is 
Gump, playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine. 
Delicate as the call of a meadow lark, Gump's music rises sweetly 
into the heavens. It is just dawn. The sun's GLOW blazes in the 
east.

129F EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

A winking GLEAM catches Jack's eyes and he reaches out an eager 
hand.

A cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers. Centred 
on his palm, golden and perfect, is Lili's ring.

129G EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Round and full, the sun rises. The golden sun rays pierce through 
the trees and start across the open meadow. Gump's music continues, 
more lyrical than ever.

As the sunlight advances, bright spring flowers push up through the 
once-frozen earth.

129H EXTERIOR UNDERWATER DAY 

Jack turns and strokes upwards, higher and higher, towards the 
shining ceiling of light far above.

129I EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY 

Gump's music swells to a crescendo. The life-giving sunlight reaches 
across the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion.

130 EXTERIOR RING POND DAY 

Jack breaks the surface, holding the ring triumphantly above his 
head.

130A EXTERIOR CLIFF ABOVE POND DAY 

The Princess sleeps under the tree. She no longer wears the black 
wedding gown, but is dressed as before. Jack's armour has also 
disappeared.

Jack kneels before Lili and slips the ring onto her finger.

He takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the 
mouth.

Lili smiles. Her eyelids flutter.

134 EXTERIOR UNICORN DEATH ARENA DAY

The unicorn's sunlit flesh twitches, dislodging a butterfly warming 
his wings on his haunch.

In a single, beautiful movement, the stallion rises to his feet. He 
arches his powerful neck and CALLS to his mate. The magic animals 
gallop off together across the open meadow.

136A EXTERIOR RING POND DAY

Princess Lili awakens.

LILI: Oh....! Jack! What a dream
I've had!

The Princess smiles when she sees the ring on her finger.

LILI (cont): Such a terrible dream....
I could never tell you....

Lili looks around, but Jack is nowhere in sight.

LILI (cont): Jack....? Where are you....?
(calling)
Green Jack!

Getting no reply, Lili wanders off in search of Jack.

137 EXTERIOR JACK'S FOREST GLADE DAY 

Puzzled, Lili searches the familiar place.

LILI (calling): Jack....! Where are you
hiding now?

The wind surges through the treetops. The leaves all move together 
as if they were a single living organism.

Jack's VOICE is heard out of the waving trees.

JACK (os): I'm everywhere, Lili....my
spirit lives in everything....

LILI: Jack.... Don't play games with me!
I love you!

JACK (os): I....love.....you...

LILI: Will you be here tomorrow?

Unseen in the bushes, Gump and the faeries hide, grinning as
they watch Lili.

JACK (os): I'm always here, Lili....
whenever you come....

Mystified, but happy, Princess Lili picks a flower and wanders off 
into the sun-bright woods.

END CREDITS ROLL

138 EXTERIOR MEADOW DAY 

A lush broad expanse, boldly pattered with wild flowers. Breasting 
the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea, the unicorn bounds 
joyfully in total freedom.

Mounted on the animal's back, his arms in victory, Jack rides like a 
triumphant angel. His hair and skin are tinted green! He is the 
incarnation of all that is magical in Nature.

               The year is 1815.                                         

               The French revolution is a distant                        
               memory. Napoleon has been defeated.                       
               France is ruled by a King again.                          


A1   EXT. TOULON PORT - DAY                                     A1       

     RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething         
     in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.         
     Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest        
     of tall masted warships.                                            

     The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their            
     rigging.                                                            

     Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships             
     under construction, and warships being refitted.                    

     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

               Home port of the French navy                              


1    EXT. TOULON DOCK - DAY                                        1     

     Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up
     and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men
     heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over           
     their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:
     these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,          
     wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched             
     onto them.                                                          

     Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being            
     hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts
     broken, rising and falling on the surge.

     As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we
     follow the straining ropes down into the base of the                
     slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist         
     in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and          
     spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he         
     seems to feel nothing.                                              


                                                                         
                                                      2.


The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -

                      CONVICTS
          Ha - Ha -

                    CONVICT 3                                   
          Ha - Ha -
          Look down, look down
          Don't look them in the eye                            

                    CONVICTS                                    
          Look down, look down
          You're here until you die.

                    CONVICT 4                                   
          No God above
          And Hell alone below

                    CONVICTS                                    
          Look down, look down
          There's twenty years to go.

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge       
of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed      
and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of
the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall.

Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of   
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in   
the mist.                                                       

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

                    CONVICT 2                                   
          I've done no wrong
          Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!

                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          Sweet Jesus doesn't care.

                    CONVICT 5                                   
          I know she'll wait
          I know that she'll be true -

                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          They've all forgotten you.                            

                    CONVICT 1                                   
          When I get free
          You won't see me
          Here for dust!
                                                         3.


                    CONVICTS
          Look down, look down
          Don't look'em in the eye.

                    CONVICT 3                                     
          How long, O Lord
          Before you let me die?

                    CONVICTS                                      
          Look down, look down
          You'll always be a slave.
          Look down, look down
          You're standing in your grave.

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the            
damaged ship onto the slipway.                                    

CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust     
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.     
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent             
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he     
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the        
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks      
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the      
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.                  

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.                                   

                    JAVERT
          Now Prisoner 24601.                                     
          Your time is up
          And your parole's begun.
          You know what that means?                               

                    VALJEAN
          Yes. It means I'm free.

                    JAVERT
          No! It means you get                                    
          Your yellow ticket-of-leave.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.                           

                    JAVERT
          This badge of shame
          You'll show it everywhere.
          It warns you're a dangerous man.                        

                    VALJEAN
          I stole a loaf of bread
          My sister's child was close to
          death
          And we were starving.
                                                          4.


                        JAVERT
              You will starve again
              Unless you learn the meaning of
              the law.

                        VALJEAN
              I know the meaning of those
              nineteen years
              A slave of the law!

                        JAVERT
              Five years for what you did,
              The rest because you tried to
              run.
              Yes, 24601!

                        VALJEAN
              My name is Jean Valjean!

                        JAVERT
              And I'm Javert!
              Do not forget my name.
              Do not forget me -
              24601!

    He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're
    marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in            
    that he is free at last.

    The convicts sing as he goes.                                       

                        CONVICTS
              Look down, look down
              You'll always be a slave.
              Look down, look down
              You're standing in your grave.


2   EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN                                2

    Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on
    his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and
    there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide
    vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the
    distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and
    below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the
    musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first
    time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.

                        VALJEAN                                         
              Freedom at last -
              How strange the taste!
              Never forget the years - the waste,
              Nor forgive them for what they've
              done.
              They are the guilty - Everyone!
              The day begins
                        (more)
                                                           5.

                         VALJEAN (cont'd)
               And now lets see
               What this new world
               Will do for me!

4    EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                                       4

     Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin
     coat close round him against the cold winter wind.

     He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches           
     the OVERSEER.                                                       

                         VALJEAN                                         
               Monsieur can I help? A day's work?                        

     The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap.             

                         OVERSEER                                        
               Take your hat off.                                        

     Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred         
     head.                                                               

                           OVERSEER                                      
               Passport.                                                 

     The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back.             

                         OVERSEER                                        
               No work here.                                             

5    SCENE OMITTED                                                 5


6    EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY                               6

     Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains.
     Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.

     He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff,
     its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind.
     The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of
     refuge. This is Digne.


6A   EXT. DIGNE - DUSK                                           6A

     Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees   
     a guard standing outside the Mairie.                            
                                                            6.


6B   INT. MAIRIE, DIGNE - DUSK                                    6B     

     Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down        
     the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the          
     town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the              
     passport.                                                           

                          OFFICER                                        
               Valjean.                                                  

     The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.                


6C   EXT. DIGNE - DUSK                                            6C

     Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an
     inn and enters.


7    INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK                                7

     Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He
     eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast
     meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a
     beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to
     reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The
     innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two
     other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase
     "Extremely Dangerous".                                              

     VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's
     hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of
     refusal.

                         INNKEEPER
               My inn is full.


7A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           7A

     Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes
     down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,
     but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure
     follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.

     Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a
     stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his
     heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife
     before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,
     and yet everything he's never had.


8    EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT                                    8

     He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell
     hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.
                                                           7.


                         VALJEAN
               Jailer. Would you let me stay here                        
               for tonight?

                         JAILER                                          
               This is a prison, not an inn. Get
               yourself arrested. Then we will
               open up for you.

     The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some
     children who have been following begin throwing stones at
     him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.


8A   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8A

     He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.         
     Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some            
     straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an
     enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.


8B   EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT                                           8B

     Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,
     weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from
     where the dog has bitten him.

     At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a
     dark churchyard.                                                    


9    EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT                               9

     Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean
     collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the
     shelter of a doorway.                                               

     A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,
     throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest
     on the crumpled figure of Valjean.

     He stirs and opens his eyes.

     VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.
     Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The            
     BISHOP.

                         BISHOP
               Come in, sir, for you are weary
               And the night is cold out here.
               Though our lives are very humble
               What we have we have to share.

     Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes
     with the Bishop into the house by the church.                       
                                                           8.


10   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                10     

     A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with          
     silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,           
     illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop      
     ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's         
     sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.               

                         BISHOP
               There is wine here to revive you.
               There is bread to make you
               strong.
               There's a bed to rest till
               morning -
               Rest from pain, and rest from
               wrong.                                                  

                         BISHOP                                        
               Sit, my brother.

     The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.

                         BISHOP
               Madame, set one more place.
                   (to Valjean)
               Please sit.

     The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.

     Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.
     Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a
     short grace.

                         BISHOP
               May the Lord bless the food we eat                      
               today. Bless our dear sister and                        
               our honoured guest.
                   (To Valjean)
               Please, eat. Where are you
               travelling to my brother?

                         VALJEAN
               Pontarlier.

                         BISHOP
               Is that where your family is?

                         VALJEAN
               No. The destination is compulsory.
               That is where the Law sends me. I
               have no home.

                         BISHOP
               Then let this be your home, for
               as long as you need it.
                                                              9.


11   INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          11

     The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are
     also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,
     Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.
     There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a
     cupboard.

     He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen
     waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his
     life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.

                         BISHOP
               Sleep well. Tomorrow morning
               before you leave you will have a
               cup of milk from our cows, nice
               and hot.

     The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.

                         VALJEAN
               You let me sleep here next to you?
               How do you know I'm not a murderer?

     Valjean laughs a strange laugh.

                         BISHOP
               God will take care of that.

     LATER THAT NIGHT -

     Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.

     Outside a dog barks.

     Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the
     light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
     on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing
     judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and
     remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.

     There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to
     the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop
     lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver
     is kept.

     Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a             
     metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor           
     boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his
     breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.
     He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard          
     door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,                  
     disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is
     over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should          
     he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and
     lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.
     He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is
     the silver.
                                                          10.


     Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last         
     look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the
     door.


12   EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT                                      12     

     Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He                
     crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's         
     gone.


13   INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY                                    13     

     The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments          
     when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean
     before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the
     Bishop's eyes.

                         CONSTABLE
               Monsignor, we caught the thief
               red-handed! He has the nerve to
               say you gave him all this!

     He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.

     The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.

                         BISHOP
               That is right.

     Amazed, Valjean looks up.

                         BISHOP
               But my friend, you left so early,
               You forgot I gave these also.
               Would you leave the best behind?

     The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.

                         BISHOP
                   (to policemen)
               Messieurs, release him.
               For this man has spoken true.
               I commend you for your duty
               Now God's blessing go with you.

     Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn
     and leave.

     Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.

                         BISHOP
               But remember this, my brother -
               See in this some higher plan.
               You must use this precious silver
               To become an honest man.
               By the witness of the martyrs,
                         (more)
                                                          11.

                          BISHOP (cont'd)
               By the passion and the blood,
               God has raised you out of
               darkness -
               I have bought your soul for God.


14   INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                   14

     Valjean kneels in the church.                                     

     He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.                

     He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.

                         VALJEAN
               What have I done?
               Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
               Become a thief in the night
               Become a dog on the run!
               And have I fallen so far
               And is the hour so late
               That nothing remains but the cry
               of my hate?
               The cries in the dark that nobody
               hears
               Here where I stand at the turning
               of the years.

               If there's another way to go
               I missed it twenty long years
               ago.
               My life was a war that could
               never be won.
               They gave me a number and
               murdered Valjean
               When they chained me and left me
               for dead
               Just for stealing a mouthful of
               bread!                                                  
               Yet why did I allow this man
               To touch my soul and teach me
               love?
               He treated me like any other
               He gave me his trust
               He called me brother.
               My life he claims for God
               above...
               Can such things be?
               For I had come to hate the world -
               This world that always hated me!

               Take an eye for an eye!
               Turn your heart into stone!
               This is all I have lived for!
               This is all I have known!
               One word from him and I'd be back
               Beneath the lash, upon the rack.
               Instead he offers me my freedom!
                         (more)
                                                          12.

                         VALJEAN (cont'd)
               I feel my shame inside me like a
               knife.
               He told me that I have a soul...
               How does he know?
               What spirit comes to move my
               life?
               Is there another way to go?

     Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high,         
     as if to the altar.

                         VALJEAN
               I am reaching, but I fall
               And the night is closing in...
               As I stare into the void -
               To the whirlpool of my sin.                               

     Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the           
     church.                                                             

                         VALJEAN                                         
               I'll escape now from that world -                         
               From the world of Jean Valjean.                           
               Jean Valjean is nothing now!                              


15   EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY                                     15

     Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and              
     reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies          
     the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley             
     below.

                         VALJEAN
               Another story must begin!                                 

     He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces
     out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind.

     FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind
     then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper              
     dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and                  
     accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne            
     far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the          
     heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to             
     tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through             
     time and space - down to discover -


16   EXT. ROAD TO MONTREUIL - DAY                                 16

     The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long         
     muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of               
     Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out         
     to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of          
     the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick           
     factory buildings.                                                  
                                                           13.

                Montreuil-sur-Mer, 1823.                                  

      The camera closes in to ground level to reveal the                  
      horseriders:                                                        

      Javert, flanked by two policemen.                                   


16A   EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY                               16A     

      As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered   
      around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to      
      get in.                                                         

                          BEGGARS' CHORUS                                 
                At the end of the day you're
                another day older
                And that's all you can say for
                the life of the poor.
                It's a struggle! It's a war!
                And there's nothing that anyone's
                giving.
                One more day standing about -
                What is it for?
                One day less to be living.

      Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless           
      as ever.

                          BEGGARS' CHORUS                                 
                At the end of the day you're
                another day colder
                And the shirt on your back
                doesn't keep out the chill.
                And the righteous hurry past
                They don't hear the little ones
                crying
                And the plague is coming on fast
                Ready to kill -
                One day nearer to dying!

      TRACK PAST a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown   
      onto a cart.                                                    

      The police enter the harbour.                                       


17    EXT. HARBOUR - MONTREUIL - DAY                              17      

      The beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for         
      the police.                                                         
                                                             14.


                            BEGGARS' CHORUS                                 
                  At the end of the day there's
                  another day dawning
                  And the sun in the morning is
                  waiting to rise
                  Like the waves crash on the sand
                  Like a storm that'll break any
                  second
                  There's a hunger in the land
                  There's a reckoning still to be
                  reckoned
                  And there's gonna be hell to pay
                  At the end of the day!

        Javert looks round at the factory buildings, the boats in           
        the harbour, the poor clamouring behind him, and rides on.          

18      SCENE OMITTED                                                18     


19      EXT. FACTORY YARD, MONTREUIL - DAY                           19

        Heavy carts wait to be loaded with wooden crates of goods.
        Workmen carry the crates out of the factory as the FOREMAN
        strides in through the doors, gesturing to a cart driver,           
        FAUCHELEVENT, who's taking a quick rest on a crate.


19A     INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - MEN'S SECTION - DAY               19A     

        The foreman passes men packing boxes on tables and loading          
        boxes onto crates. He passes through a door under a first           
        floor office.                                                       


20-22   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - WOMEN'S SECTION - DAY        20-22        

        The long work space is full of tables at which                      
        conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry            
        out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. An              
        impressive sight: obviously a very successful business. A
        wooden staircase climbs one wall to a glass-windowed
        business office. The figure of a man within.

                            FOREMAN
                      (flirtatiously, to women)                             
                  At the end of the day you get
                  nothing for nothing!
                  Sitting flat on your bum doesn't
                  buy any bread!

                            FACTORY WOMAN 4                                 
                  There are children back at home -

                            FACTORY WOMAN 2                                 
                  And the children have got to be
                  fed.
                                                      15.


                    FACTORY WOMAN 7                              
          And you're lucky to be in a job -

The Foreman has stopped beside FANTINE, a pretty young woman.   
As he leans over to whisper in her ear Fantine, surprised,      
pricks her finger with her needle.                              

                    FOREMAN                                      
              (quietly, to Fantine)                              
          And in a bed!

                    FACTORY WOMAN 8                              
              (to Fantine, as a warning)                         
          And we're counting our blessings!                      

The Foreman continues his rounds, encouraging the women to       
speed up their work.                                             

                    FOREMAN                                      
          At the end of the day just be glad                     
          to be working
          For a master who cares for the
          lives of the poor.                                     

                    FACTORY WOMAN 7                              
          He's a riddle..

                    FACTORY WOMAN 4                              
          He's no fool..

                    FACTORY WOMAN 6                              
          He's the answer to anyone's prayer

                    FACTORY WOMAN 8                              
          And he paid for the brand new                          
          school

                    FACTORY WOMAN 4                              
          It's no wonder they made him the
          mayor!

                    FACTORY WOMEN                                
          Bless the man who leads the way!
          At the end of the day!

They get on with their tasks, all glancing up at the boss in     
the office above.                                                

The Foreman returns to Fantine, trying to help her.              

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                           
          Have you seen how the foreman is
          fuming today                                           
          With his terrible breath and his
          wandering hands?
                                                     16.


                    FACTORY WOMAN 3                              
          It's because little Fantine won't
          give him his way.

                    FACTORY WOMAN 5                              
          Take a look at his trousers,
          you'll see where he stands!

                    FACTORY WOMAN 2                              
          And the boss, he never knows
          That the foreman is always on                          
          heat.

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                           
          If Fantine doesn't look out,
          Watch how she goes,
          She'll be out on the street!                           

The Foreman rings a bell, announcing the end of the work day.   

The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their     
tools for the day.                                               

                     FACTORY WOMEN/FOREMAN                       
          At the end of the day its another
          day over
          With enough in your pocket to last
          for a week                                             
          Pay the landlord, pay the shop                         
          Keep on working as long as you're                      
          able                                                   
          Keep on working till you drop                          
          Or it's back to the crumbs off the
          table                                                  
          Well, you've got to pay your way                       
          At the end of the day!                                 

The women queue up to be paid by the Foreman at the door.        

Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman           
snatches the letter away from Fantine.                           

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                           
          And what have we here, little
          innocent sister?

The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women      
workers.                                                         

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                           
          Come on, Fantine, let's have all
          the news.
              (reading)
          `Dear Fantine, you must send us
          more money,
          Your child needs a doctor,
          There's no time to lose.'
                                                     17.


                    FANTINE
          Give that letter to me
          It is none of your business.
          With a husband at home
          And a bit on the side!
          Is there anyone here
          Who can swear before God
          She has nothing to fear?
          She has nothing to hide?

The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over     
to the Foreman.                                                 

Fantine tries to get the letter back. The women scuffle.

The owner enters the factory floor. We see him only from        
behind: a well-dressed prosperous man.                          

                    VALJEAN
          What is this fighting all about?
          Will someone tear these two
          apart?
          This is a factory, not a circus.

As he sings, the CAMERA MOVES ROUND to discover him. Clean-
shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean.

                    VALJEAN
          Now come on, ladies, settle down.
          I run a business of repute.

Suddenly Valjean sees Javert appear on the first floor          
balcony of his office. His world drops away.                    

                    VALJEAN
              (to the foreman)
          Deal with this, Foreman.                              
          Be as patient as you can.                             

He walks back to the stairs up to his office.                   

On the factory floor -

                    FOREMAN
          Now someone say how this began!

The factory women all turn on Fantine.

                    FANTINE/FACTORY WOMAN 5                     
          At the end of the day she's the
          one who began it!

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                          
          There's a kid that she's hiding                       
          in some little town.

                    FACTORY WOMAN 5                             
          There's a man she has to pay                          
                                                     18.


                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                         
          You can guess how she picks up
          the extra -
          You can bet she's earning her
          keep
          Sleeping around!
          And the boss wouldn't like it.

                    FANTINE
          Yes, it's true there's a child
          And the child is my daughter
          And her father abandoned us,
          Leaving us flat.
          Now she lives with an innkeeper
          man and his wife
          And I pay for the child.
          What's the matter with that?

Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the     
women sing -                                                   

                    FACTORY WOMEN
          At the end of the day she'll be
          nothing but trouble
          And there's trouble for all when
          there's trouble for one!
          While we're earning our daily
          bread
          She's the one with her hands in
          the butter -
          You must send the slut away
          Or we're all going to end in the
          gutter
          And it's us who'll have to pay
          At the end of the day!

The Foreman pulls Fantine away.                                

                    FOREMAN
          I might have known the bitch
          could bite!
          I might have known the cat had
          claws!
          I might have guessed your little
          secret!
          Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
          Who keeps herself so pure and
          clean -
          You'd be the cause, I had no
          doubt
          Of any trouble hereabout.
          You play a virgin in the light
          But need no urging in the night!

                    MAIN FACTORY WOMAN                         
          She's been laughing at you
          While she's having her men!
                                                          19.


                         FACTORY WOMEN                                   
               She'll be nothing but trouble
               again and again!

                         FACTORY WOMAN 5                                 
               You must sack her today!

                         FACTORY WOMEN
               Sack the girl today!

                         FOREMAN
               Right, my girl! On your way!

     Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office
     above with a pitiful cry.

                         FANTINE
               M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a
               child!

     Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns
     round to face Javert.                                               

     Javert stares at him.

     On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine
     out, as she struggles against him.                                  


23   INT. FACTORY OFFICE - DAY                                    23

     Javert bows.                                                        

                         JAVERT
               I introduce myself,
               Inspector of Police.
               I've come to take the watch
               I'm here to keep the peace.
               Please know me as Javert.

               I'm here at your command
               With honour due to each.
               With justice in our hands
               No man's beyond our reach.
               Let all beware.

                         VALJEAN
               Welcome, sir
               Come guard our laws
               I'm sure we're here
               In common cause.

     Javert turns to look through the high window onto the men's         
     factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day.          

                         JAVERT
               You've done the city proud,
               You've raised their banner high.
                         (more)
                                                            20.

                           JAVERT (cont'd)
                 You manufacture gems
                 That anyone can buy
                 Your people thrive.

     Valjean shows some demonstration samples of their work.

                           VALJEAN
                 The dignity of toil
                 To stay alive.

     Javert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but
     from where?

                           JAVERT
                 It seems to me
                 We may have met.

     Valjean throws him a sharp glance.

                           VALJEAN
                 Your face is not a face
                 I would forget.

     A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -


24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24

     Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and
     down the muddy track beyond to discover -

     A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -             
     Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a
     crate.

     The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart
     off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is
     too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in
     the   mud.

     Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,
     but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.
     All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing
     Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.
     Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart
     have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws
     himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces
     himself to lift it from beneath.

                           VALJEAN
                 Get back! It may fall!

                           FOREMAN
                 No, Monsieur le Mayor!

                           CROWD
                 It'll kill you as well!
                                                     21.


Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a
memory stirring in him.

JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is
exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.
The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal
determination.

Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what
he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears
Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.
Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the
cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and
gasping man, the others pull him clear.

Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he
brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.

                    JAVERT
          Can this be true?
          I don't believe what I see!
          A man your age
          To be as strong as you are!
          A memory stirs...                                    
          You make me think of a man                           
          From years ago                                       
          A man who broke his parole..                         
          He disappeared.                                      

He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions
are.

                    JAVERT
          Forgive me, sir.
          I would not dare -

                    VALJEAN
          Say what you must.
          Don't leave it there.

Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.      
Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.                

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.                             

                    VALJEAN                                    
          Let me help you up.                                  

Fauchelevent groans as he rises.                               

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Monsieur le Mayor, you come from
          God!
          You are a saint!

                    VALJEAN                                    
          No more cart driving for you!                        
                                                             22.


     Javert stares. He can't rid himself of his suspicion.

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor.

     He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he            
     discusses something with his assistant.                              


25   EXT. HARBOUR, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                               25     

     Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. Beggars shelter in   
     the tunnels under the red brick buildings.                      


26   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26

     Fantine makes her way down   wet slimy steps. This leads to an       
     alleyway that runs down to   the harbour and three ships lying       
     on the mud at low tide. At   the far end, the largest is the         
     rotting hulk of a vast old   warship. A single whore sits in a       
     doorway.                                                             

                         FANTINE                                          
               Excuse me, is this where the                               
               Pawnbrokers is?                                            

                         WHORE 1                                          
                   (pointing)                                             
               It's just there.                                           

                            FANTINE                                       
               Thank you.                                                 

     Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below. The               
     first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse.                       

                         SAILOR 1
               I smell women!
               Smell'em in the air!
               Think I'll drop my anchor
               In that harbour over there!

     They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. Fantine presses   
     on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.                

                         SAILOR 2
               Lovely ladies!                                             
               Love `em till your broke!                                  
               Seven months at sea can make you
               Hungry for a poke!

     The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows         
     of warehouse doorways.                                               

                         SAILOR 3
               Even stokers need a little stoke!
                                                        23.


A man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an        
organ-grinder and from doorways and overhead windows             
harbour whores appear and tout for business.                     

A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear            
fragments of his sales pitch.                                    

            WHORES                         TOOTH MAN

During the above chorus, Fantine sells a locket containing a     
cutting of Cosette's hair to the pawnbroker.                     

                    PAWNBROKER                                   
          Hello sweetheart, I'll give you                        
          four francs.                                           

                    FANTINE                                      
          It's worth at least ten.                               

The pawnbroker goes back in his shop and Fantine watches the     
whores.                                                          

                    FANTINE                                      
          Alright, five.                                         

The pawnbroker takes the locket in exchange for the money.       

An old woman leers at Fantine from the shadows, beckoning.       
She approaches Fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.

                    HAIR CRONE                                   
          What pretty hair!
          What pretty locks you've got                           
          there!
          What luck you got.
          It's worth a centime, my dear!
          I'll take the lot!

                    FANTINE
          Don't touch me! Leave me alone!

                    HAIR CRONE                                   
          Let's make a price.
          I'll give you all of ten francs.
          Just think of that!
                                                             24.


                          FANTINE
                It pays a debt...

                          HAIR CRONE                                       
                Just think of that.

                          FANTINE
                What can I do? It pays a debt.
                Ten francs may save my poor
                Cosette.

      The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of         
      the stairs.                                                          

      Fantine is sat on a low stool. She bows her head before the          
      hair crone, who at once whips out a razor blade and cuts             
      off her hair at the roots.                                           


26A   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - END OF DAY               26A     

      Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the          
      voices of the whores on either side.                                 

      A PIMP and the HEAD WHORE watch her progress as the organ-           
      grinder grinds out the music.                                        

      Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the          
      spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the         
      rotting ship.                                                        

      The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear          
      by the end of the chorus.

      Fantine reaches the hair crone.                                      

                          FANTINE                                          
                Please, you wouldn't have any work

                you my hair. I could do anything.                          

      The hair crone points at the head whore and the tooth man.           
                                                             25.


                          HAIR CRONE                                       
                Go and see them.                                           

      Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore.              

                TOOTH MAN                        HEAD WHORE
      Come over here,                   Come here my dear.
                                        I'll pay well for your youth.   
      I pay ten francs for a tooth.

      Fantine heads to the tooth man.                                      

                          TOOTH MAN                                        
                You have, my dear,
                The clear advantage of youth.

                Just the back ones.                                        

                          TOOTH MAN

      She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to
      inspect her teeth.                                                   

                          TOOTH MAN
                I do it fast,
                I know my business all right.
                It's worth a go.

      The pimp pushes her down.                                            

                          FANTINE
                You'll pay me first
                What I am due.

                          TOOTH MAN
                You'll get twice
                If I take two!

      She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone              
      gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth           
      is removed.                                                          


26B   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT MONTREUIL - NIGHT                    26B     

      The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're          
      all fit for business.

                    PIMP
          Cheer up, deary!

          Plenty more like you here

          Deary knows her place!

The pimp gestures at Fantine, now slumped in a doorway, her
cropped head in her hands.

A shy captain watches Fantine. The pimp notices.                

                    PIMP
          Gimme the dirt -
          Who's that bit over there?

                    WHORE 1

          She's the one sold her hair.

                    PIMP
          I might've known
          There is always some man.

He moves in on Fantine.

                    PIMP
          Lovely lady, come along and join
          us!
          Lovely lady!

Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her
mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to
draw her in to their world. On the rotting warship, more        
whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the           
chorus.

          ...at the bottom of the heap.                         

Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge      
Fantine's cheeks.

The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders     
of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the      
hulk.

          All it takes is money in your

The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to     
Fantine who wears a filthy white dress. The pimp joins the      
captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates -      
like a twisted wedding ceremony.

     Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain          
     into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel.

27   INT. ROTTING SHIP'S HULK, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                  27

     Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the             
     captain down to the damp dregs of the ship.                         

     We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter,             
     then Fantine lays down.

                         FANTINE
               Easy money lying on a bed.

               Don't they know they're making love
               To one already dead?                                      


28   INT. ROTTING SHIP'S HULK, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                  28     

     CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. We hear him exit. MOVE         
     TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress.

     She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head
     of the mattress. She draws her legs up and wraps her arms
     round her knees, huddling against the misery of the world.

                         FANTINE
               There was a time when men were
               kind,
               When their voices were soft
               And their words inviting.
               There was a time when love was
               blind
               And the world was a song
               And the song was exciting.
               There was a time...
               Then it all went wrong.

               I dreamed a dream in time gone
               by,
               When hope was high
               And life worth living.
               I dreamed that love would never
               die.
               I dreamed that God would be
               forgiving.

                         FANTINE (cont'd)

               Then I was young and unafraid
               And dreams were made and used and
               wasted.
               There was no ransom to be paid,
               No song unsung, no wine untasted.

               But the tigers come at night
               With their voices soft as thunder
               As they tear your hope apart
               As they turn your dream to shame.

               He slept a summer by my side,
               He filled my days with endless
               wonder.
               He took my childhood in his
               stride
               But he was gone when autumn came.

               And still I dream he'll come to
               me!
               That we will live the years
               together...
               But there are dreams that cannot
               be
               And there are storms we cannot
               weather...

               I had a dream my life would be
               So different from this hell I'm
               living -
               So different now from what it
               seemed!
               Now life has killed the dream I
               dreamed.

     As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head      
     whore beyond.                                                     


29   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                 29

     Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside,              
     shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly,
     but still attempts an alluring smile.

     She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits,
     trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a
     stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some
     way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to       
     a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.           

     As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-
     dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives        
     with two friends and a valet.                                     
                                                     30.


                    BAMATABOIS
          Here's something new. I think
          I'll give it a try.
          Come closer, you! I like to see
          what I buy.
          The usual price
          For just one slice of your pie.                       

                    FANTINE
          I don't want you! No! No,
          M'sieur! Let me go!

                    BAMATABOIS
          Is this a trick? I won't pay
          more!

                    FANTINE
          No, not at all!                                       

                    BAMATABOIS
          You've got some nerve, you little
          slut!
          You've got some gall!                                 
          It's the same with a tart as it is                    
          with a grocer                                         
          The customer sees what he gets in                     
          advance                                               
          It's not for the whore to say "yes                    
          sir" or "no sir"                                      
          It's not for the harlot to pick and                   
          to choose or to lead me a dance!                      

He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down      
her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the   
snow and Bamatabois laughs.                                     

                    FANTINE
          I'll kill you, you bastard!
          Try any of that!
          Even a whore who has gone to the
          bad
          Won't be had by a rat!                                

Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois        
touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His         
friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.                  

                    BAMATABOIS
              (furious but aroused)                             
          By Christ you'll pay for what
          you've done!
          This rat will make you bleed,
          you'll see!
          I guarantee I'll make you suffer!
          For this disturbance of the peace
          For this insult to life and
          property!
                                                     31.


Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.            

                    FANTINE
          I beg you, don't report me, sir.
          I'll do whatever you may want.                      

                    BAMATABOIS
          Make your excuse to the police!

Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's     
Javert.

                    JAVERT
          Tell me quickly what's the story.
          Who saw what and why and where?
          Let him give a full description,
          Let him answer to Javert!
          In this nest of whores and vipers
          Let one speak who saw it all.
          Who laid hands on this good man
          here?
          What's the substance of this
          brawl?

                    BAMATABOIS
          Javert, would you believe it?                       
          I was walking, it was dark
          When this prostitute attacked me
          You can see she's left her mark!

He shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.

                    JAVERT
          She will answer for her actions
          When you make a full report.
          You may rest assured, M'sieur,
          That she will answer to the
          court.

Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with
occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is
approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine     
up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he         
approaches Fantine.                                           

                    FANTINE
          There's a child who sorely needs
          me,
          Please, m'sieur, she's but that
          high.
          Holy God, is there no mercy?
          If I go to jail she'll die.                         

                    JAVERT
          I have heard such protestations
          Every day for twenty years.
          Let's have no more explanations,
                    (more)
                                                     32.

                    JAVERT (cont'd)
          Save your breath and save your
          tears.

Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.     

Valjean steps out of the shadows.

                    VALJEAN
          A moment of your time, Javert.
          I do believe this woman's tale.

                    JAVERT
          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    

                    VALJEAN
          You've done your duty. Let her
          be.
          She needs a doctor, not a jail.

                    JAVERT
          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    

Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches
out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to
her in a dream -

                    FANTINE
          Can this be?

                    VALJEAN
          Where will she end -
          This child without a friend?

He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.

                    VALJEAN
          I've seen your face before.
          Show me some way to help you.
          How have you come to grief
          In such a place as this?

                    FANTINE
          M'sieur, don't mock me now, I
          pray
          It's hard enough I've lost my
          pride.
          You let your foreman send me
          away.
          Yes, you were there
          And turned aside.
          I never did no wrong.

                    VALJEAN
          Is it true what I've done -

                    FANTINE
          My daughter's close to dying.
                                                          33.


                         VALJEAN
               - to an innocent soul?

                         FANTINE
               If there's a God above -

                         VALJEAN
               Had I only known then!

                         FANTINE
               He'd let me die instead.

                         VALJEAN
               In His name my task has just begun.
               I will her to the hospital.                             

     Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.                             

     Javert is quietly coldly furious.

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor!                                      

                         FANTINE
               Bring Cosette back to me.

                         VALJEAN
               Where is she?

                         FANTINE
               At an inn in Montfermeil...

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor!                                      

                         VALJEAN
               I will see it done! I will send                         
               for her immediately!                                    

     As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them,       
     then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow          
     after them.                                                       


30   EXT. POLICE STATION, MONTREUIL - DAY                       30     

     As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his            
     assistant stops him with an urgent letter.                        

                         JAVERT'S ASSISTANT
               From Paris, Monsieur.

     Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his
     expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a
     terrible mistake.
                                                          34.


31   INT. FACTORY, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                              31

     Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his
     papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and          
     stands before him. He looks up.

                         JAVERT
               Monsieur le Mayor
               I have a crime to declare!
               I have disgraced
               The uniform that I wear.
               I've done you wrong,
               Let no forgiveness be shown.
               I've been as hard
               On every rogue I have known.
               I'll bear the blame,
               I must be treated
               Just the same.

                         VALJEAN
               I don't understand.
               What is this crime, Javert?

                         JAVERT
               I mistook you for a convict,
               I have made a false report.
               Now I learn they've caught the
               culprit -
               He's about to face the court.

     Valjean conceals his shock.

                         JAVERT
               And of course the thief denies
               it,
               You'd expect that from a con.
               But he couldn't run for ever,
               No, not even Jean Valjean.

                         VALJEAN
               You say this man denies it all,
               And gives no sign of
               understanding or repentance?
               You say this man is going to
               trial,
               And that he's sure to be returned
               to serve his sentence?

                         JAVERT
               He will pay, and so must I.
               Press charges against me, sir!

                         VALJEAN
               You have only done your duty
               It's a minor sin at most.
               All of us have been mistaken                              
               You'll return, sir, to your post.
                                                           35.


                          JAVERT
                Must I do as you say?

                          VALJEAN
                It's your duty to obey!

      Javert is about to protest again, but Valjean raises one
      commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert
      gives an abrupt bow, and departs.

      Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.

                          VALJEAN
                They think that man is me -
                Without a second glance.
                This stranger they have found -
                This man could be my chance!

                Why should I save his hide?
                Why should I right this wrong?
                When I have come so far
                And struggled for so long?

                If I speak I am condemned.
                If I stay silent, I am damned!

      He goes out onto the balcony that looks down on the empty           
      factory.

                          VALJEAN
                I am the master of hundreds of
                workers -
                They all look to me.
                Can I abandon them?
                How would they live
                If I am not free?

                If I speak they are condemned.
                If I stay silent, I am damned!


31A   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                     31A     

      Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks.            

                Who am I?
                Can I condemn this man to
                slavery?
                Pretend I do not feel his agony?
                This innocent who bears my face,
                Who goes to judgement in my
                place...
                Who am I?


31B   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                     31B     

      Valjean is furiously packing stuff up.                              
                                                             36.


                          VALJEAN                                          
                Can I conceal myself for ever
                more?
                Pretend I'm not the man I was
                before?
                And must my name until I die
                Be no more than an alibi?


31C   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT.                                   31C     

      Close on two horses panting. A stopped carriage in a wide            
      night landscape. The driver is Valjean, hesitating.                  


                Must I lie?
                How can I ever face my fellow
                men?
                How can I ever face myself again?                          


31D   INT/EXT. COURTROOM - NIGHT                                   31D     

      Valjean hesitates outside the courtroom and in the lobby of          
      the courtroom, pacing back and forth.                                

                          VALJEAN
                My soul belongs to God, I know,
                I made that bargain long ago.
                He gave me hope when hope was
                gone!
                He gave me strength to journey
                on!
                Who am I?
                Who am I?
                I'm Jean Valjean!

      Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the                 
      courtroom.                                                           


32    INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT                                       32      

      The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-
      out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the            
      real Valjean. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the            
      doors open and Valjean bursts in. Sensation in the court.

                          VALJEAN
                And so, your honour, you see it's
                true
                That man bears no more guilt than
                you!
                Who am I?
                24601!
                                                          37.


     The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the              
     court can't believe what they've just heard. The Mayor of
     Montreuil-sur-Mer, a convict!

                         VALJEAN
               If you don't believe me ask
               Inspector Javert. He knows where to
               find me.

     The judge goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out.            

                         JUDGE                                           
               Monsieur le Mayor, you are not                            
               well, you must come with me, do you                       
               have a carriage outside? Monsieur                         
               le Mayor, we must get you home to                         
               bed immediately!!                                         



33   INT. HOSPITAL, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                             33     

     The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.             

     Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a
     nursing sister outside Fantine's room.

                         VALJEAN
               Is her daughter with her?

                         NURSE
               No, monsieur. Her guardian sent
               this.

     She gives Valjean a note. He reads it with mounting anger.

                         VALJEAN
               `Money not enough. Send more.
               Thenardier.' What sort of man is
               this?


34   INT. HOSPITAL, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                             34     

     Fantine lies in bed, delirious. She is dressed in pure              
     white. Her eyes are closed.                                         

                         FANTINE
               Cosette, it's turned so cold!
               Cosette, it's past your bedtime!
               You've played the day away
               And soon it will be night.

     Fantine's eyes open and she sees Cosette, playing in the            
     room. She looks healthy and is dressed prettily.                    

               Come to me, Cosette, the light is
               fading.
                         (more)
                                                     38.

                     FANTINE (cont'd)
          Don't you see, the evening star                      
          appearing?                                           
          Come to me, and rest against my                      
          shoulder,                                            
          How fast the minutes fly away and                    
          every minute colder?                                 

Valjean enters, and sees at once that Fantine is close to      
the end. He drops to his knees by her bed.

                     VALJEAN
          Dear Fantine, Cosette will be                        
          here soon!                                           
          Dear Fantine, she will be by your                    
          side                                                 

                    FANTINE
              (trying to get out of bed)                       
          Come Cosette, the night has grown                    
          so cold!                                             

                    VALJEAN
              (putting her back in bed)                        
          Be at peace! Be at peace ever
          more.

                    FANTINE
          My Cosette -

                    VALJEAN
          - shall live in my protection.

                    FANTINE
          Take her now!

She pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's
written her wishes.

                    VALJEAN
          Your child will want for nothing.

                     FANTINE
          Good m'sieur, you come from God
          in heaven.

                    VALJEAN
          And none shall ever harm Cosette
          as long as I am living.

Fantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her
fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries
to reach up to him.

                    FANTINE
          Take my hand...
          The night grows ever colder.
                                                     39.


                    VALJEAN
          Then I will keep you warm.

He wraps her in his arms.

                    FANTINE
          Take my child
          I give her to your keeping.

                    VALJEAN
          Take shelter from the storm.

                    FANTINE
          For God's sake, please stay till
          I am sleeping...
          And tell Cosette I love her
          And I'll see her when I wake...

Fantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's      
shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as        
she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice     
of Javert behind him.                                           

                    JAVERT
          Valjean, at last
          We see each other plain!
          `M'sieur le Mayor'
          You'll wear a different chain!

Valjean stands to face Javert.                                  

                     VALJEAN
          Before you say another word,
          Javert,
          Before you chain me up like a
          slave again,
          Listen to me! There is something
          I must do.
          This woman leaves behind a
          suffering child.
          There is none but me who can
          intercede -
          In mercy's name, three days are
          all I need,
          Then I'll return, I pledge my
          word!
          Then I'll return...

Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean.                  

                    JAVERT                                      
          You must think me mad!
          I've hunted you across the years.
          Men like you can never change -
          A man such as you!

Valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof.          
                                                     40.


The men start to circle each other.                              

They sing at the same time, duelling in song.

                    VALJEAN
          Believe of me what you will
          There is a duty that I'm sworn to
          do.
          You know nothing of my life -
          All I did was steal some bread.
          You know nothing of the world -
          You would sooner see me dead.
          But not before I see this justice
          done!

                     JAVERT
          Men like me can never change.
          Men like you can never change.
          No, 24601!
          My duty is to the law.
          You have no rights.
          Come with me, 24601!

The two men fight.                                               

                    VALJEAN
          I am warning you, Javert,
          I'm a stronger man by far!
          There is power in me yet!
          My race is not yet run!

                    JAVERT                                       
          Now the wheel has turned around -
          Jean Valjean is nothing now.
          Dare you talk to me of crime
          And the price you had to pay.
          Every man is born in sin
          Every man must choose his way.

Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an       
attic door.                                                      

          You know nothing of Javert!
          I was born inside a jail.
          I was born with scum like you.
          I am from the gutter too.

Valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden            
loading platform beneath a hoist. Below, the walls of the        
factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide.        
Javert is triumphant.                                            

Valjean glances down and pushes back, dropping into the          
darkness of the ocean.                                           

Javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do     
it.                                                              
                                                              41.


      Javert stares into the black sea - there is no sign of                
      Valjean.                                                              


34A   EXT. HARBOUR, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                               34A     

      Javert and various police search the harbourside with                 
      lanterns.                                                             

      Valjean, dripping wet, watches from a tunnel under a factory,   
      as Fantine's body wrapped in a shroud is dumped on a cart.      

      They sing to themselves, continuing their duet without                
      knowing.                                                              

                          VALJEAN                                           
                And this I swear to you tonight -

                          JAVERT
                There is no place for you to
                hide.

                          VALJEAN
                Your child will live within my
                care -

                          JAVERT
                Wherever you may hide away -

                          VALJEAN
                And I will raise her to the
                light.

                          JAVERT/VALJEAN
                I swear to you, I will be there!                            


35    EXT. MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                                       35      

      The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost
      Fair. Families and visitors are out buying baubles, or                
      laughing at the antics of travelling players. Small girls             
      cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls.           
      Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years:              
      EPONINE.                                                              

      Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn. A                
      sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the           
      inn to be `The Sergeant of Waterloo'. The inn is still                
      closed despite the small crowd at the fair.                           

      MOVE IN on the frosted window of the inn, through which we            
      see a little girl, COSETTE, gazing out at the display of
      dolls.
                                                          42.


36   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - END OF DAY                           36

     Cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor. She's come
     to a stop, gazing out of the window, mesmerized by the              
     sight of the most beautiful doll in the display, and                
     jealous that Eponine can see it and touch it up close.              

                         COSETTE
               There is a castle on a cloud
               I like to go there in my sleep.
               Aren't any floors for me to
               sweep,
               Not in my castle on a cloud.

     Cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted          
     grimy rag - this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.        

               There is a lady all in white
               Holds me and sings a lullaby.
               She's nice to see and she's soft to
               touch                                                     
                   (holding doll to her ear                              
                     and whispering)                                     
               She says, Cosette, I love you
               very much.

               I know   a place where no one's
               lost
               I know   a place where no one
               cries.
               Crying   at all is not allowed,
               Not in   my castle on a cloud.                            

     Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad           
     mood. She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed          
     sign from "closed" to "open".                                       

                          MADAME THENARDIER
               Now look who's here!
               The little madam herself,
               Pretending once again
               She's been so awfully good!
               Better not let me catch you
               slacking!
               Better not catch my eye!
               Ten rotten francs your mother
               sends me -
               What is that going to buy?
               Now take that pail,
               My little Mademoiselle,
               And go and draw some water from
               the well.
               We should never have taken you in
               In the first place -
               How stupid the things that we do!
               Like mother, like daughter, the
               scum of the street.
                                                     43.


Cosette goes to put the broom away.                               

Eponine comes in from outside.                                    

                    MADAME THENARDIER                             
          Eponine, come my dear.
          Eponine, let me see you.
          You look very well in that little
          blue hat!
          There's some little girls who
          know how to behave
          And they know what to wear
          And I'm saying thank heaven for
          that!

Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is             
hiding behind the far wall. We see Cosette's frightened           
eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.                    

                    MADAME THENARDIER                             
          Still there, Cosette?
          Your tears will do you no good!
          I told you to fetch some water
          from the well in the wood.

                    COSETTE
              (singing through the gap)                           
          Please do not send me out alone.
          Not in the darkness on my own.

Madame Thenardier imitates Cosette as she sings.                  

                    MADAME THENARDIER
              (singing through the gap)                           
          Enough of that, or I'll forget to
          be nice!
          You heard me ask for something,
          And I never ask twice!                                  

The innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been            
loitering outside come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a     
newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardier's past. Madame     
Thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost      
fair stall on the porch of the inn.                               

                    CUSTOMER 1                                    
          Mine host Thenardier
          He was there, so they say,
          At the field of Waterloo.

                    CUSTOMER 2                                    
          Got there, it's true,
          When the fight was all through
          But he knew just what to do.

                    CUSTOMER 3                                    
          Crawling through the mud,
          So I've heard it said,
                    (more)
                                                           44.

                          CUSTOMER 3 (cont'd)
                Picking through the pockets of
                the English dead.

                          CUSTOMER 4                                      
                He made a tidy score from the
                spoils of war.

      We suddenly hear the voice of the landlord, Thenardier. He          
      has been there all the time, asleep on a bench. He wakes            
      from his drunken slumbers and roars out:                            

                          THENARDIER
                My band of soaks,
                My den of dissolutes,
                My dirty jokes, my always pissed
                as newts,
                My sons of whores,
                Spend their lives in my inn!
                Homing pigeons homing in -
                They fly through my doors,
                And their money's as good as
                yours!


36A   EXT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                                36A     

      Madame Thenardier is trying to sell something unappealing           
      from her stall to a portly looking man when slushy snow             
      from the stall's roof falls on the man's head. Madame               
      Thenardier ushers him inside.                                       


37    INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                                37      

                          THENARDIER
                Welcome, m'sieur!
                Sit yourself down
                And meet the best
                Innkeeper in town!

      Madame Thenardier pretends to accidentally drop a comb from         
      her hair and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing           
      Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as          
      he stands up. Monsieur Thenardier takes his coat which              
      allows the couple to see the customer transfer a pocket             
      watch from coat to jacket pocket.                                   

                          THENARDIER
                As for the rest -
                All of them crooks
                Rooking the guests
                And cooking the books.
                Seldom do you see
                Honest men like me
                A gent of good intent
                Who's content to be -

      He pours a strong drink for the new customer -
                                                           45.


                          THENARDIER
                Master of the house!
                Doling out the charm
                Ready with a handshake
                And an open palm

      Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake        
      as a distraction. He passes this off to Madame Thenardier.         

                          THENARDIER
                Tells a saucy tale
                Makes a little stir
                Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
                Glad to do a friend a favour
                Doesn't cost me to be nice
                But nothing gets you nothing
                Everything has got a little
                price!

                Ready to relieve'em
                Of a sou or two -

                Watering the wine


37A   INT. KITCHEN, INN, MONTFERMEIL - FLASHBACK - DAY           37A     

      Thenardier is pissing into the very wine bottle he's using to   
      serve the customer.

                Making up the weight
                Picking up their knick-knacks

                Everybody loves a landlord
                Everybody's bosom friend!
                I do whatever pleases -
                Jesus! Won't I bleed'em in the
                end!


37C   EXT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                               37C     

      At Madame Thenardier's stall, a frost fair customer is             
      covered by snow, only this time we realise Madame Thenardier       
      is responsible for pushing the snow off the awning with a          
      stick.                                                             

                          THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

                          THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS (cont'd)
                Never wants a passer-by
                To pass him by!

      Madame Thenardier ushers the customer inside.                         


37D   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - DUSK                                  37D     

      Again Madame Thenardier drops her comb in front of the new            
      customer but this time the thieving is foiled by little               
      Cosette who helpfully picks it up. Over the chorus she shouts         
      at little Cosette to get out.

                lifelong mate

                Everybody's chaperone -

                          THENARDIER
                But lock up your valises -
                Jesus! Won't I skin you to the
                bone!

      A FAMILY enters the inn. Thenardier fusses over them.                 

                          THENARDIER
                Enter, messieurs!                                           
                Lay down yer load
                Unlace yer boots
                And rest from the road.
                This weighs a ton
                Travel's a curse
                But here we strive
                To lighten your purse.

      He's got the father's purse out, and is removing notes.               

                          THENARDIER
                Here the goose is cooked
                Here the fat is fried
                And nothing's overlooked

38    INT. KITCHEN, INN, MONTFERMEIL - FLASHBACK - DAY              38      

      Thenardier shows off the secrets of the squalid kitchen -
      every possible animal being used to make mince meat.                  

                          THENARDIER V/O

      Thenardier serves the disgusting food that we've seen him           
      create in the flashback to the family.

                There are lots of tricks he knows
                How it all increases
                All those bits and pieces -
                Jesus! It's amazing how it grows.


39    EXT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               39

      Thenardier comes out of the inn, backed by a posse of his
      gang of loyal customers, and takes control of a brass band to   
      sing to the Frost Fair.                                         

                          THENARDIER/CUSTOMERS

      Further down the street, carrying her empty buckets, Cosette
      turns to look sadly back at the cheery sight.

      The Portly Customer has discovered he's been robbed. He            
      comes out to protest, holding out his emptied wallet. At
      once two of Thenardier's thugs grab him and hustle him off.

                          THENARDIER
                Dirty bunch of geezers
                Jesus! What a sorry little lot!


39A   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                              39A     

      Madame Thenardier approaches a handsome soldier who is             
      drinking at a table by the fire in the inn. She sits on his        
      lap and gets him to look back at Thenardier, so allowing her       
      to see inside his coat and spot his wallet.                        

                          MADAME THENARDIER
                I used to dream
                That I would meet a prince
                But God almighty
                Have you seen what's happened
                since?

                Cunning little brain

                Thinks he's quite a lover
                But there's not much there.

      As Madame Thenardier reaches for the man's groin, she lifts        
      his wallet skillfully and hands it off to Monsieur                 
      Thenardier.                                                        

                          THENARDIER                                     
                What a cruel trick of nature
                Landed me with such a louse.
                God knows how I've lasted
                Living with this bastard in the
                house!

      She pulls the young man into a dance, enabling her to steal        
      everything else of value he has. Father Christmas has also         
      been lured from the frost fair and the Thenardiers slit his        
      presents sack and exchange it for a sack containing snow.          
                                                             49.

42      EXT. WOOD BY THE INN - NIGHT                                 42

        Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and
        is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse
        the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.
        She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to
        herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle
        on a Cloud'.

        After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the
        buckets.

        Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her
        hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.

                            VALJEAN
                  Hush now, do not be afraid of me.
                  Don't cry. Show me where you live.
                            (more)
                                                          50.

                         VALJEAN (cont'd)
               Tell me, my child, what is your
               name?

                         COSETTE
               I'm called Cosette.

                          VALJEAN
               Cosette?

     She gazes up at him. Hardly knowing why, the little girl
     trusts this stranger. Valjean picks up the heavy buckets, and
     they head back towards the inn. As they go, they hum `Castle
     on a Cloud' together.


43   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               43

     Valjean enters with Cosette. Madame Thenardier hurries             
     over. Madame and Monsieur Thenardier try to thieve from            
     Valjean using the same tricks established earlier, but he          
     evades every attempt. Eponine watches silently from a              
     corner.

                         VALJEAN
               I found her wandering in the wood
               This little child, I found her
               trembling in the shadows.
               And I am here to help Cosette,
               And I will settle any debt you
               may think proper.
               I will pay what I must pay
               To take Cosette away.

               This is a duty I must heed.
               There is a promise I have made.
               For I was blind to one in need,
               I did not see what stood before
               me.
               Now your mother is with God.
               Her suffering is over,
               And I speak here with her voice,
               And I stand here in her place,
               and from this day, and ever more -

                         MADAME THENARDIER
               Let me take your coat, m'sieur!

                         VALJEAN
               Cosette shall live in my
               protection.                                              

                         THENARDIER
               You are very welcome here!

                         VALJEAN
               I will not forget my vow.
                                              51.


                    THENARDIER
          Take a glass!

                    MADAME THENARDIER
          Take a chair!

                    VALJEAN
          Cosette shall have a father now.

Thenardier turns to his wife.

                    THENARDIER
          What to do? What to say
          Shall you carry our treasure
          away?
          What a gem! What a pearl!
          Beyond rubies is our little girl!
          How can we speak of debt?
          Let's not haggle for darling
          Colette!

                     MADAME THENARDIER
          Cosette!

                    THENARDIER
          Cosette -
          Dear Fantine - gone to rest -
          Have we done for her child what
          is best?
          Shared our bread - shared each
          bone -
          Treated her like she's one of our
          own!
          Like our own, m'sieur!

                    VALJEAN
          Your feelings do you credit, sir.
          And I will ease the parting blow.
          Let us not talk of bargains and
          bones and greed.

He gives Thenardier money.

                    VALJEAN
          Now may I say we are agreed?

                    MADAME THENARDIER
          That would quite fit the bill
          If she hadn't so often been ill.
          Little dear, cost us dear!
          Medicines are expensive, m'sieur.
          Not that we begrudged a sou -
          It's no more than we Christians
          must do.

Valjean gives more money.
                                                           52.


                         THENARDIERS
               One thing more! One small doubt!
               There are treacherous people
               about!
               No offence! Please reflect!
               Your intentions may not be
               correct!

     Valjean hands over more money.

                          VALJEAN
               No more! Here's your price!
               Fifteen hundred for your
               sacrifice.
               Come, Cosette, say goodbye.
               Let's seek out some friendlier
               sky.
               Thank you both for Cosette -
               It won't take you too long to
               forget.

     He leads Cosette to the door.


44   EXT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               44

     Valjean lifts Cosette into the waiting cab.

                         VALJEAN
               Where I go, you will be.

                         COSETTE
               Will you be like a Papa to me?

                         VALJEAN
               Yes, Cosette!
               This is true!
               I'll be father and mother to you!

     The cab sets off down the road.


45   INT. INN, MONTFERMEIL - NIGHT                               45

     Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her
     husband's hand and inspects them.

                          THENARDIER
               Not bad!

                         MADAME THENARDIER
               Not enough!

     Through the open door Thenardier sees a man on horseback           
     rattling up to the inn.
                                                          53.


                         MADAME THENARDIER
               There's a copper at the door!
               What the devil have you done?

     Javert strides into the inn.

                         JAVERT
               Where's the child Cosette?

                         MADAME THENARDIER
               She's gone with a gent,
               Didn't tell us where they went,
               Didn't leave his home address.

                         JAVERT
               Did you catch the fellow's name?

     Both Thenardiers shake their heads.

     Javert stares once, contemptuously, round the seedy inn,
     and departs without a further word. Thenardier goes to the
     doorway to watch him leave.

                         MADAME THENARDIER
               You're a bloody fool
               Look at what we got.

                         THENARDIER
               Should have struck the iron,
               Struck it while it's hot.

                         THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER
               Next time round we'll be here
               And we're gonna get the lot.


46   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS - NIGHT                              46

     Valjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the
     city.

     IN CAB - Valjean has one arm round Cosette to protect her
     from the jolting of the cab. He gazes at her as she slips
     into a fitful sleep.

                          VALJEAN
               Suddenly I see
               Suddenly it starts
               When two anxious hearts
               Beat as one.
               Yesterday I was alone
               Today you walk beside me
               Something still unclear
               Something not yet here
               Has begun.
               Suddenly the world
               Seems a different place
               Somehow full of grace
                          (more)
                                                           54.

                          VALJEAN (cont'd)
                And delight.

                How was I to know
                That so much love
                Was held inside me?
                Something fresh and young
                Something still unsung
                Fills the night.

                How was I to know at last
                That happiness can come so fast?
                Trusting me the way you do
                I'm so afraid of failing you
                Just a child who cannot know
                That danger follows where I go
                There are shadows everywhere
                And memories I cannot share

                Nevermore alone
                Nevermore apart
                You have warmed my heart
                Like the sun.
                You have brought the gift of life
                And love so long denied me.

                Suddenly I see
                What I could not see
                Something suddenly
                Has begun.

      He brushes the hair from her face, and satisfies himself
      that she's comfortable. Then he puts his head out of the
      window. At the gate into Paris, soldiers are checking              
      documents of occupants of carriages.                               

      Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes           
      his way along the wall, away from the gate.                        


46A   EXT. PARIS BROKEN WALL - NIGHT                             46A     

      Valjean finds a section of tumble down wall and climbs over.       


46B   EXT. PARIS SLUM STREET - NIGHT                             46B     

      Valjean and Cosette make their way down a darkened street.         


46C   EXT. PARIS - RIVER SEINE - NIGHT                           46C     

      Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer           
      hurrying.                                                          

      The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river.             
      Valjean stops. There, on the other side of the river, in the       
      light of a lamp, stands Javert.                                    
                                                          55.

48   EXT. MAZE OF OLD STREETS - NIGHT                           48     

     Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys,
     into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.
     Whenever Valjean thinks they've thrown their pursuer, there
     he is, not far behind. And he's no longer alone. With him
     are a detachment of soldiers.                                     

     Javert and his team never seem to run. But he's always            
     there.


49   EXT. DEAD END - NIGHT                                      49

     Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by
     high windowless houses. They follow it round a corner to
     find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're
     trapped.

     Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp
     bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower
     the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties
     one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding
     the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to
     brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls
     Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down
     onto the other side.

     A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.
     Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of
     women's voices, singing a psalm.

                         NUNS
               Te lucis ante terminum
               Rerum Creator poscimus
               Ut pro tua clementia
               Sis praesul et custodia...

     Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down
     after her.

     Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.


50   INT. CONVENT CLOISTER - NIGHT                              50

     Valjean crouched low, with Cosette in his arms, holding her
     still and quiet until Javert is gone.

     Then he straightens up and looks round. He takes in the
     sound of singing.

          Ne polluantur corpora...

He goes closer to the windows of the building. Through the
blurry glass he can make out a chapel, and a line of nuns
singing.

Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave.
The man starts as he sees Valjean.

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Who's that?

Valjean jumps, takes Cosette protectively into his arms.
Turns to answer.

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!

It's Fauchelevent, now a gardener, still limping from his
injury.

                    VALJEAN
          Who are you?

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          Don't you remember? The cart fell
          on me!                                               

                    VALJEAN                                    
          Monsieur Fauchelevent!                               

                    FAUCHELEVENT                               
          You saved my life! You got me
          this job as a gardener!

Valjean gazes at him, and remembers.

                     VALJEAN
          Now you can do the same for me.
          We need a place of sanctuary.
          This child and I, we need to
          disappear.

                    FAUCHELEVENT
          In this place of Holy Orders
          You are brought to God's domain
          May the sisters grant you shelter
          May their prayers ease your pain.

Valjean and Cosette follow him to the convent.

                    VALJEAN
          We'll give thanks for what is
          granted
          What the sisters may ordain
          Here we pray for new beginnings -
          Here our lives can start again.
                                                           57.


     Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air
     and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over
     Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.


51   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE, PARIS - DAY                       51

     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

               Nine years later

     The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument,
     made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands
     on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far
     side, the remains of the great fortress that was the
     Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built
     triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the
     new regime.

     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

               Paris, 1832.

     The streets that run from the square lead in one direction
     to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction
     into the slums.

     The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.

     A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -
     GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At
     once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from
     every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,
     Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.


52   EXT. PARIS BOULEVARD - DAY                                   52

     FOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard,              
     dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars,
     weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to
     make their way in either direction. These are the
     conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched
     horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill,
     they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to
     coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.

     As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-
     faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -

                          BEGGARS CHORUS
               Look down and see the beggars at
               your feet!
               Look down and show some mercy if
               you can!
               Look down and see the sweepings
               of the street!
                          (more)
                                                     58.

                    BEGGARS CHORUS (cont'd)
          Look down, look down,
          Upon your fellow man!

The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert
their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows
to shut out the sight of the losers of their world.

Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of
liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one            
particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH           
OCCUPANT.                                                      

                    GAVROCHE
          `Ow do you do? My name's
          Gavroche!
          These are my people, here's my
          patch.
          Not much to look at - nothing
          posh!
          Nothing that you'd call up to
          scratch.
          This is my school, my high
          society!
          Here in the slums of St Michel.
          We live on crumbs of humble piety
          Tough on the teeth - but what the
          hell!
          Think you're poor? Think you're
          free?
          Follow me! Follow me!

                    BEGGARS CHORUS
          Look down and show some mercy if
          you can!
          Look down, look down, upon your
          fellow man!

STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of
another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at         
last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang     
hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting       
after to hear his political lecture.                           

                    GAVROCHE
          There was a time we killed the
          King
          We tried to change the world too
          fast.
          Now we have got another King,
          He is no better than the last.
          This is the land that fought for
          liberty -
          Now when we fight we fight for
          bread!
          Here is the thing about equality -
          Everyone's equal when they're
          dead.
          Take your place!

                                                          59.

                         GAVROCHE (cont'd)
               Take your chance!
               Vive la France! Vive la France!


53   EXT. LAMARQUE'S HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                         53     

     The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a         
     crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of       
     sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch       
     what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes      
     gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A         
     priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two        
     altar boys.                                                       

     Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd.     
     The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student                
     revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out      
     printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd.                     

                         STUDENTS/BEGGARS CHORUS                       
               Look down and show some mercy if                        
               you can!                                                
               Look down, look down, upon your                         
               fellow man!                                             

                         COURFEYRAC                                    
               When's it gonna end?

                         BEGGAR 1

               Something's gotta happen now!

                         BEGGAR 2                                      
               Something's gotta give!

                         STUDENTS AND BEGGARS                          
               It'll come, it'll come, it'll
               come...
               It'll come, it'll come, it'll
               come...

     A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an           
     impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. The occupant       
     of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius'         
     Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson     
     engaged in such an activity.                                      

     In the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed   
     longingly on the handsome Marius.                               

                         ENJOLRAS
               Where are the leaders of the
               land?
               Where are the swells who run this
               show?
                                                        60.


                    MARIUS
          Only one man, General Lamarque                        
          Speaks for the people here below!

Marius looks towards Lamarque's house behind him.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Lamarque is ill and fading fast -
          Won't last a week out, so they
          say.

                    MARIUS
          With all the anger in the land,
          How long before the Judgement
          Day?

                    ENJOLRAS
          Before we cut the fat ones down
          to size?

                    STUDENTS                                    
          Before the barricades arise?

Mounted Police ride in to break up the crowd.                   

                    POLICE                                      
          Look down, look down, don't look us                   
          in the eye!                                           
          Look down, look down, stay here and                   
          you die!                                              

The crowd breaks up. The students shout to the crowd:           

                    ENJOLRAS                                    
          Tomorrow we will return!                              

                    MARIUS                                      
          Tell everyone you know                                

                    COURFEYRAC                                  
          We will show them!                                    

                    COMBEFERRE                                  
          Lamarque is the only leader on our                    
          side!                                                 

                    COURFEYRAC                                  
          We have a right to pray for

                    JOLY                                        
          We need more people, then the                         
          police will not dare ride against                     
          us!                                                   

                    MARIUS                                      
          Vive le General Lamarque!                             
                                                             61.


     Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down,                
     furious.                                                             

                         GILLENORMAND                                     
               Do you have any idea of the shame                          
               you bring on your family! You're                           
               behaving like a child.                                     

     Gillenormand spies a gun poking out of his jacket.                   

     Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage.                      


54   INT. GORBEAU TENEMENT                                         54     

     Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty          
     mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a               
     hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His         
     eye is caught by the ring on his finger.                             

     CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.                              

     Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.              

     We reveal EPONINE staring at him through the door.                   

                         EPONINE                                          
               Hey there Monsieur what's new                              
               with you?                                                  
               Haven't seen much of you of late.                          
               Planning no doubt to change the                            
               world?                                                     
               Plotting to overthrow the state?                           
               Still living here in this old sewer                        
               Might as well doss down in a ditch                         
               You still pretending to be poor                            
               Everyone knows your Grandpa's rich                         

     Marius rushes down the stairs of the slum, Eponine following.   
     We see glimpses of misery off the stairwell.                    

                         MARIUS                                           
               How did you...?                                            

                         EPONINE                                          
               There's lots of things I know                              

                         MARIUS                                           
               Won't take a franc that I've not                           
               earned                                                     
               All of those bridges have been                             
               burned.                                                    

                         EPONINE                                          
               I like the way you talk Monsieur!                          

                         MARIUS                                           
               I like the way you always tease.                           
                                                          62.


     Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.

                         EPONINE
               Little he knows -
               Little he sees.


55   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY                       55     

     Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau         
     Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees          
     two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,          
     Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The          
     two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from               
     evening church service.                                             

     Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen
     anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental
     foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.

     As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets
     his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he
     already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held              
     gaze.                                                               

     Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,         
     at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.                  

     Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her
     jealously from this distant boy's gaze.                             

     We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the             
     Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's           
     approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,                  
     Clacquesous, Montparnasse.                                          

                          THENARDIER
               Everyone here, you know your
               place -
               Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous -
               You, Montparnasse, watch for the
               law -                                                     
               With Eponine - take care.
                   (Montparnasse hurries over                            
                     to the doorway where                                
                     Eponine was watching                                
                     Marius)                                             
               You turn on the tears!                                    
                   (to Madame Thenardier who                             
                     is holding a baby)                                  
               No mistakes, my dears!

     Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth          
     of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the               
     ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps            
     behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.                     
                                                     63.


                    THENARDIER
          Please, M'sieur, come this way.
          Here's a child that ain't eaten
          today.
          Save a life, spare a sou!
          God rewards all the good that you
          do.

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she          
recognizes him.                                                 

                    MADAME THENARDIER                           
          Wait a bit! Know that face!
              (to Monsieur Thenardier)                          
          Ain't the world a remarkable
          place!

                    THENARDIER                                  
          Men like me don't forget -
          You're the bastard who borrowed
          Cosette!

                    VALJEAN
          What is this? Are you mad?
          No, Monsieur, you don't know what
          you say!

Thenardier pulls off his disguise. Valjean recognises him.      

                    THENARDIER
          You know me! I know you!
          And you'll pay what I'm due.

He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway            
revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean          
menacingly.                                                     

                    EPONINE                                     
              (shouts from up the                               
               street)                                          
          It's the police! Disappear!                           
          Run for it! It's Javert!                              

The gang spill out into the street to find themselves           
confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as       
does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.

                    JAVERT
          Another brawl in the square!
          Another stink in the air!
          Was there a witness to this?
          Well, let him speak to Javert!

He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does     
not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face.          
                                                       64.


                    JAVERT
          Monsieur, these streets are not
          safe.
          But let these vermin beware,
          We'll see that justice is done!

He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage.

                    JAVERT
          Look upon this fine collection
          Crawled from underneath a stone.
          This swarm of worms and maggots
          Could have picked you to the
          bone!
          I know this man over here,
          I know his name and his trade.
          And on your witness, m'sieur,
          I'll see him suitably paid.

He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone.                

                    JAVERT
          But where's the gentlemen gone?
          And why on earth did he run?

                    THENARDIER
          You will have a job to find him!
          He's not all he seems to be -
          And that girl he trails behind
          him
          She's the child he stole from me!

Marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.

                     JAVERT
          Could it be he's that old
          jailbird
          That the tide now washes in?
          Heard my name and started
          running...
          All the omens point to him.

Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest.
So Valjean is a crook like him.

                    JAVERT
          And the girl who stood beside
          him,
          When I turned they both had gone.
          Could he be the man I've hunted?
          Could it be he's Jean Valjean?

                    THENARDIER
          In the absence of a victim,
          Dear Inspector, may I go?
          And remember when you've nicked
          him
          It was me what told you so.
                                                        65.


                    JAVERT
              (to himself)
          Let the old man keep on running
          I will run him off his feet!
              (to the crowd)
          Everyone about your business!

              (to Gavroche)                                      
          Clear this garbage off the
          street!

Gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it     
when Javert surprises him.                                       

He is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to       
Marius who is close by.                                          

                    GAVROCHE
          That inspector thinks he's
          something
          But it's me who runs this town!
          And my theatre never closes
          And the curtain's never down!
          Trust Gavroche! Have no fear!
          You can always find me here!                           

                    EPONINE
          Cosette! Now I remember...
          Cosette! How can it be?
          We were children together.
          Look what's become of me.

She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine! Who was that girl?

                    EPONINE
          That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!

                    MARIUS
          Eponine, find her for me!

                    EPONINE
          What will you give me?

                      MARIUS
          Anything!

                    EPONINE
          Got you all excited now,
          But God knows what you see in
          her.
          Aren't you all delighted now?                          
          No, I don't want your money, sir.
                                                             66.


                            MARIUS                                          
                  Eponine, do this for me,
                  Discover where she lives.
                  But careful how you go -
                  Don't let your father know.
                  Eponine! I'm lost until she's
                  found.

                            EPONINE
                  You see? I told you so!
                  There's lots of things I know!
                  Eponine, she knows her way
                  around.

62      EXT. PARIS POLICE HQ - NIGHT                                 62

        WIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a           
        huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside           
        looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings            
        he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the          
        HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights
        reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city.
        Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer.

                            JAVERT
                  There, out in the darkness
                  A fugitive running
                  Running from God
                  Fallen from grace -
                  God be my witness
                  I never shall yield
                  Till we come face to face -
                  Till we come face to face...

                  He knows his way in the dark
                  Mine is the way of the Lord
                  Those who follow the path of the
                  righteous
                  Shall have their reward
                  And if they fall
                  As Lucifer fell -
                  The flame!

                  The sword!
                  Stars in your multitudes!
                  Scarce to be counted
                  Filling the darkness
                  With order and light -
                  You are the sentinels
                  Silent and sure
                  Keeping watch in the night -
                  Keeping watch in the night...

                  You know your place in the sky
                  You hold your course
                            (more)
                                                             67.

                         JAVERT (cont'd)
               And your aim
               And each in your season
               Returns and returns
               And is always the same
               And if you fall
               As Lucifer fell
               You fall
               In flame!

               And so it must be, and so it is
               written
               On the doorway to paradise
               That those who falter
               And those who fall
               Must pay the price!

               Lord, let me find him
               That I may see him
               Safe behind bars!
               I will never rest till then!
               This I swear
               This I swear by the stars!

     Javert stands silhouetted against the stars, his arms
     raised up to the night sky.


63   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - NIGHT                             63     

     Marius comes down the street, his mind full of thoughts of           
     Cosette.


64   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - NIGHT                                      64     

     Marius arrives at the first floor front room. Here a group           
     of students are cleaning rifles and sharing their
     excitement at the coming revolution: ENJOLRAS, COMBEFERRE,
     COURFEYRAC, JOLY, GRANTAIRE, FEUILLY, PROUVAIRE and others.

                         ENJOLRAS                                         
               Well, Courfeyrac! Do we have all                           
               the guns?                                                  
               Joly, Prouvaire! Our time is                               
               running short!                                             

                         COURFEYRAC                                       
               Students, workers, everyone!                               
               There's a river on the run!                                
               Like the flowing of the tide,                              
               Paris is coming to our side!                               

                         COMBEFERRE                                       
               Enjolras! At Notre Dame
               The sections are prepared!
                                                     68.


                      FEUILLY
            At Rue du Bac
            They're straining at the leash!

                      ENJOLRAS                                 
            Grantaire, put the bottle down!                    
            Did we get the guns we need?                       

                      GRANTAIRE                                
            Give me brandy on my breath                        
            And I'll breathe them all to death!                

                      ENJOLRAS                                 
            The time is near...
            So near it's stirring the blood
            in their veins.
            And yet beware!                                    
            Don't let the wine go to your
            brains.
            For the army we fight is a
            dangerous foe
            With the men and the arms that we
            never can match.
            It is easy to sit here and swat
            them like flies
            But the National Guard will be
            harder to catch.
            We need a sign
            To rally the people
            To call them to arms
            To bring them in line!

Joly turns goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look     
on his face.

                      JOLY
            Marius, wake up!
            What's wrong today?
            You look as if you've seen a
            ghost.

                      GRANTAIRE
            Some wine, and say what's going
            on!

They sit.                                                      

                      MARIUS
            A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe!
            She was like a ghost to me -
            One minute there - then she was
            gone!

                      GRANTAIRE
            I am agog! I am aghast!
            Is Marius in love at last?
            I've never heard him Ooh and Aah.
            You talk of battles to be won
                      (more)
                                                        69.

                    GRANTAIRE (cont'd)
          And here he comes like Don Juan!
          It is better than an opera!

They burst into laughter. But Enjolras isn't smiling.

                    ENJOLRAS
          It is time for us all
          To decide who we are.
          Do we fight for the right
          To a night at the opera now?
          Have you asked yourselves
          What's the price you might pay?
          Is this simply a game
          For rich young boys to play?
          The colours of the world
          Are changing day by day -

          Red -    the blood of angry men!
          Black    - the dark of ages past!
          Red -    a world about to dawn!
          Black    - the night that ends at
          last!

                    MARIUS
          Had you seen her today
          You might know how it feels
          To be struck to the bone
          By a moment of breathless delight!

          Had you been there today
          You might also have known
          How the world may be changed
          In just one burst of light
          And what was right seems wrong
          And what was wrong seems right!

                       GRANTAIRE
          Red!

                    MARIUS
          I feel my soul on fire!

                       GRANTAIRE
          Black!

                    MARIUS
          My world if she's not there!

                       STUDENTS
          Red!

                    MARIUS
          The colour of desire!

                       STUDENTS
          Black!
                                                       70.


                    MARIUS
          The colour of despair!

                    ENJOLRAS
          Marius, you're no longer a child -
          I do not doubt you mean it well
          But now there is a higher call!
          Who cares about your lonely soul?
          We strive towards a larger goal -
          Our little lives don't count at
          all!

                    ENJOLRAS

          The dark of ages past!                               
          Red - a world about to dawn!
          Black - the night that ends at
          last!                                                

A scuffle at the door - Gavroche struggling with the
barman. Courfeyrac lets him through.                           

                    GAVROCHE
          Listen! Listen to me!

                    COURFEYRAC                                 
          Listen, everybody!

                    GAVROCHE                                   
          General Lamarque is dead!

Enjolras turns to his companions.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Lamarque is dead...
          Lamarque... His death is the hour
          of fate.
          The people's man...
          His death is the sign we await!
          On his funeral day they will
          honour his name
          With the light of rebellion
          ablaze in their eyes.
          From their candles of grief we
          will kindle our flame.
          On the tomb of Lamarque shall our
          barricades rise!

          The time is here!

                         ENJOLRAS (cont'd)
               Let us welcome it gladly with
               courage and cheer!

                         STUDENT                                         
               Let us take to the street with no
               doubt in our hearts

               But a jubilant shout!

               They will come one and all!

               They will come when we call!

     As the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to             
     Marius. Marius sees her.                                            


65   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                     65     

     Cosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the           
     best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are              
     open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at          
     herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the             
     first time.                                                         

                         COSETTE                                         
               How strange -
               This feeling that my life's begun
               at last!
               This change -
               Can people really fall in love so
               fast?
               What's the matter with you,
               Cosette?
               Have you been too much on your
               own?
               So many things unclear -
               So many things unknown...

               In my life
               There are so many questions and
               answers
               That somehow seem wrong.
               In my life
               There are times when I catch in
               the silence
               The sigh of a faraway song
               And it sings
               Of a world that I long to see -
               Out of reach
               Just a whisper away
               Waiting for me!

               Does he know I'm alive?
               Do I know if he's real?
                         (more)
                                                     72.

                    COSETTE (cont'd)
          Does he see what I see?
          Does he feel what I feel?

          In my life
          I'm no longer alone -
          Now the love in my life
          Is so near...
          Find me now! Find me here!

Valjean knocks and opens her door. He closes her shutters.     

                    VALJEAN
          Dear Cosette,
          You're such a lonely child.
          How pensive, how sad you seem to
          me.
          Believe me, were it within my
          power
          I'd fill each passing hour.
          How quiet it must be, I can see,
          With only me for company.

                     COSETTE
          There's so little I know
          That I'm longing to know
          Of the man that you were
          In a time long ago...
          There's so little you say
          Of the life you have known,
          Why you keep to yourself,
          Why we're always alone.
          So dark! So dark and deep,
          The secrets that you keep!
          In my life
          Please forgive what I say
          You are loving and gentle and
          good.
          But papa, dear papa,
          In your eyes I am still like that
          child
          Who was lost in a wood.

                    VALJEAN
          No more words -
          No more words.
          It's a time that is dead.
          There are words
          That are better unheard,
          Better unsaid.

                     COSETTE
          In my life
          I'm no longer a child and I yearn
          For the truth that you know
          Of the years... Years ago!
                                                             73.


     Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. A simple wooden        
     shack at the back of the summerhouse, Valjean himself lives          
     with spartan simplicity - he has given the best room to              
     Cosette.                                                             

     Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to                
     Cosette.                                                             

                         VALJEAN
               You will learn.
               Truth is given by God
               To us all in our time,
               In our turn.                                               


66   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       66     

     Marius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the             
     far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's             
     house.                                                               

                          MARIUS
               In my life
               She has burst like the music of
               angels
               The light of the sun!
               And my life seems to stop
               As if something is over
               And something has scarcely begun!
               Eponine, you're the friend
               Who has brought me here.
               Thanks to you I am one with the
               Gods
               And heaven is near!
               And I soar through a world that
               is new,
               That is free!                                              

                          EPONINE
               Every word that he says
               Is a dagger in me!
               In my life
               There's been no one like him
               anywhere,
               Anywhere, where he is
               If he asked... I'd be his!

                          MARIUS/EPONINE
               In my life
               There is someone who touches my
               life -

                         MARIUS
                   (sees Cosette in the

               Waiting near!
                                                     74.


                    EPONINE
          Waiting here!                                         

                    MARIUS
          A heart full of love!

Cosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards       
him. She sees Eponine by Marius's side.                         

                    MARIUS                                      
          A heart full of song!
          I'm doing everything all wrong -
          Oh God, for shame -
          I do not even know your name.
          Dear Mad'moiselle,
          Won't you say?
          Will you tell?

Cosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both        
hands, eyes on Marius. Eponine looks on and suffers. Marius     
wraps his hands round Cosette's.                                

                    COSETTE
          A heart full of love!
          No fear, no regret!

                    MARIUS
          My name is Marius Pontmercy.

                    COSETTE
          And mine's Cosette.

                    MARIUS
          Cosette... I don't know what to
          say -

                    COSETTE
          Then make no sound.

                    MARIUS
          I am lost -

                    COSETTE
          I am found!

                    MARIUS
          A heart full of light -

                    COSETTE/MARIUS
          A night bright as day -

                    MARIUS
          And you must never go away,
          Cosette - Cosette!

                    COSETTE
          This is a chain we'll never
          break.
                                                      75.


                    MARIUS
          Do I dream?

                       COSETTE
          I'm awake.

                    MARIUS
          A heart full of love -

                     EPONINE
          He was never mine to lose
          Why regret
          What could not be?

                    COSETTE
          A heart full of you -

                    EPONINE
          These are words he'll never say
          Not to me, not to me
          Not for me!

                    MARIUS
          A single look and then I knew!

                    COSETTE
          I knew it too!

                    EPONINE
          His heart full of love...

                    MARIUS
          From today -

                    EPONINE
          He will never feel this way.

                    COSETTE
          Every day...

                     MARIUS/COSETTE
          For it isn't a dream -
          Not a dream
          After all!

Valjean comes to the door.

                    VALJEAN
          Cosette! Cosette!                                   

Cosette turns and runs in to the house.

Valjean walks down the overgrown garden path to the gate.     

Marius moves quickly away, instinctively nervous of
discovery, and hides behind the wall.                         
                                                     76.


Valjean peers into the shadows. He senses that perhaps
Cosette has been talking to someone. He looks pensive.

Valjean returns inside.                                         

Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks   
it up.                                                          

Marius makes his way back down the street, filled with          
thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there.   

Shadows move up the street from the other direction. It's       
Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron
gate.

                    MONTPARNASSE
          This is his lair!
          I've seen the old fox around.

                    BABET
          He keeps himself to himself
          He's staying close to the ground.

                    THENARDIER
          I smell profit here!
          Ten years ago
          He came and paid for Cosette.
          I let her go for a song.
          It's time we settled the debt.
          This'll cost him dear.

                    BRUJON
          What do I care
          Who you should rob?
          Gimme my share!
          Finish the job!

                    THENARDIER
          You shut your mouth!
          You'll get what's yours!

Brujon starts working on the gate lock. He finds Eponine
lurking in the shadows.

                    BRUJON
          What have we here?

                    THENARDIER
          Who is this hussy?

                    BABET
          It's your brat Eponine!
          Don't you know your own kid?
          Why's she hanging about here?
                                                           77.


                         THENARDIER
               Eponine, get on home!
               You're not needed in this.
               We're enough here without you.

                         EPONINE
               I know this house, I tell you!
               There's nothing here for you!
               Just the old man and the girl.
               They live ordinary lives.

                         THENARDIER
               Don't interfere!
               You've got some gall!
               Take care, young miss,
               You've got a lot to say!

                         BRUJON
               She's going soft!

                         CLACQUESOUS
               Happens to all!

                         MONTPARNASSE
               Go home, Eponine!
               Go home, you're in the way!

     They huddle round the garden gate, which is now broken
     open.

                          EPONINE
               I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn
               them here!

                         THENARDIER
               One little scream and you'll
               regret it for a year!

     He goes to the gate and opens it.

     Eponine screams.

68   INT. RUE PLUMET, PARIS - NIGHT                              68

     Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns
     to the window.


69   EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                     69

     Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows, as
     Eponine's scream ends at last.
                                                          78.


                         THENARDIER
               Make for the sewers!
               Get underground!
               Leave her to me,
               Don't wait around!

     He turns on Eponine and slaps her hard across the face.            

                         THENARDIER
               You wait, my girl!
               You'll rue this night!                                   
               I'll make you scream!
               You'll scream all right!

     His men have levered up a grating, and now Thenardier and
     the gang disappear down into the sewers.


70   INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE - RUE PLUMET, PARIS - NIGHT            70     

     Valjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes           
     her in his arms.

                         VALJEAN
               My God, Cosette!
               I heard a cry in the dark.
               I heard the shout of angry voices
               in the street.

                         COSETTE
               Three men I saw beyond the
               wall...
               Three men in shadow moving fast!

                         VALJEAN
               This is a warning to us all!
               These are the shadows of the
               past!

     He moves away to his own bedroom.                                  

                         VALJEAN
               Must be Javert.
               He's found my cover at last.
               I've got to get Cosette away
               Before he returns.

     He comes back to Cosette.                                          

                         VALJEAN
               We must get away from shadows
               That will never let us be.
               Tonight we leave Cosette!                                

                           COSETTE

               And then a ship across the sea.                           

                         VALJEAN
               Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave,
               And say no more.
               Tonight we'll away!

               Hurry, Cosette!
               It's time to close another door
               And live another day!

     Valjean leaves to start packing.                                    

     Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter.

72   EXT. GARDEN, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                              72

     Cosette hurries down the   garden to the gate, and goes to          
     put the folded letter in   the grill where her and Marius'          
     hands entwined. Then she   sees Eponine. Eponine steps              
     forward. She thrusts her   letter into her hand.                    

                         COSETTE
               Please give this to Marius! He
               must know where to find me.

     She runs back inside.


73   EXT. RUE PLUMET/BRIDGE/RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - NIGHT          73     

     Eponine crumples up the letter.                                     

     She walks sadly away down the street.

     Rain is just starting to fall.

                         EPONINE
               And now I'm all alone again -
               Nowhere to turn, no one to go to.
               Without a home, without a friend,
                         (more)
                                              80.

                    EPONINE (cont'd)
          Without a face to say hello to.
          The city goes to bed
          And I can live inside my head.

          On my own
          Pretending he's beside me
          All alone
          I walk with him till morning
          Without him
          I feel his arms around me
          And when I lose my way I close my
          eyes
          And he has found me.

She crosses a bridge over the river.

                    EPONINE
          In the rain
          The pavement shines like silver
          All the lights
          Are misty in the river
          In the darkness the trees are
          full of starlight
          And all I see is him and me
          forever and forever!

          And I know it's only in my mind -
          That I'm talking to myself and
          not to him.
          And although I know that he is
          blind,
          Still I say there's a way for us.

          I love him
          But when the night is over
          He is gone - the river's just a
          river.
          Without him the world around me
          changes -
          The trees are bare and everywhere
          The streets are full of
          strangers.

          I love him
          But every day I'm learning
          All my life I've only been
          pretending.
          Without me, his world will go on
          turning
          A world that's full of happiness
          That I have never know.

          I love him
          I love him
          I love him
          But only on my own.
                                                              81.


      Her solitary journey has brought her to the Gorbeau slum.             
      She goes inside.                                                      


73A   INT. GORBEAU TENEMENT - NIGHT                                 73A     

      Eponine stands outside Marius' door. She opens the letter,            
      reads it, then hides it in her pocket. She pushes open                
      Marius' door. Marius looks up.                                        

                          EPONINE                                           
                I came to tell you she's gone.

                          MARIUS
                Gone? What do you mean?                                     

                          EPONINE                                           
                She's gone to England.                                      

      Marius sets off at a run towards the Rue Plumet.                      


74    EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       74

      Marius finds the gate broken open, sees the house beyond
      dark and deserted. He pushes in to the garden, up to the
      house windows, sees the rooms empty within. He stands
      staring, in shock.

      Eponine has followed him, and watches him in silence.



75    SCENE OMITTED                                                 75      


76    INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT.                                        76      

      Valjean and Cosette sit on either side of the carriage,               
      apart, staring out of their respective windows. A stark               
      contrast to the carriage scene when Valjean sang to Cosette           
      as a little girl.                                                     

                          VALJEAN
                One day more!
                Another day, another destiny.
                This never-ending road to
                Calvary.
                These men who seem to know my
                crime
                Will surely come a second time -
                One day more!


77    EXT. RUE PLUMET - NIGHT                                       77

      Marius by the empty house.
                                                          82.


                         MARIUS
               I did not live until today -                              
               How can I live when we are parted?                        


78   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                        78     

                         VALJEAN
               One day more!                                             

                         COSETTE
               Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
               And yet with you my world has
               started!


79   EXT/INT. RUE PLUMET/CARRIAGE - NIGHT                         79     

     INTERCUT between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean
     in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden.                     

                         EPONINE
               One more day all on my own...

                         MARIUS/COSETTE
               Will we ever meet again?

                         EPONINE
               One more day with him not
               caring...

                         MARIUS/COSETTE
               I was born to be with you!

                         EPONINE
               What a life I might have known...

                         MARIUS/COSETTE
               And I swear I will be true!

                         EPONINE
               But he never saw me there.


80   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN GROUND & 1ST FLOOR/EXT. RUE DE LA           80     
     CHANVRERIE - NIGHT                                                  

     Enjolras and the students have a production line under way
     for making bullets. The rifles are now stacked and ready
     for the uprising. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a           
     BARMAID. MADAME HUCHELOUP the proprietress of the Cafe              
     Musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the               
     students.                                                           

                         ENJOLRAS
               One more day before the storm!
                                                          83.


     INTERCUT WITH Marius walking back sadly through the Rue de          
     la Chanvrerie. Eponine follows him at a distance.                   

                         MARIUS
               Do I follow where she goes?

                         ENJOLRAS
               At the barricades of freedom!

                         MARIUS
               Shall I join my brothers there?

                         ENJOLRAS
               When our ranks begin to form -

                         MARIUS
               Do I stay and do I dare?

                         ENJOLRAS
                   (from top of stairs, for                              
                    Grantaire's benefit)                                 
               Will you take your place with me?                         

     Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs.                         

                         ALL
               The time is now!
               The day is here!
               One day more!


81   INT. PARIS POLICE HQ - NIGHT                                 81

     Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the
     coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police
     Headquarters.

                         JAVERT
               One day more to revolution.
               We will nip it in the bud.
               We'll be ready for these
               schoolboys.
               They will wet themselves with
               blood!


82   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                        82     

                         VALJEAN
               One day more!


83   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - GROUND & 1ST FLOOR - NIGHT                83     

     Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar,         
     slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the               
     stairs disguised in a piece of cloth.                               
                                                           84.


     Joly takes a tray and collects empty tankards. As he               
     ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to           
     give the tankards back.                                            

                         THENARDIERS
               Watch'em run amuck!
               Catch'em as they fall!
               Never know your luck
               When there's a free-for-all.
               Here a little dip,
               There a little touch -
               Most of them are goners
               So they won't miss much!

     The drinkers in the bar raise their glasses to the students
     with their rifles. The students appeal to them. Grantaire
     is drunk already. Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot        
     to make more bullets. Marius enters the ground floor and           
     takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup that she has just         
     finished. The citizens on the ground floor join the                
     students.                                                          

                         STUDENTS/CROWD                                 
               One day to a new beginning!
               Raise the flag of freedom high!
               Every man will be a king!
               Every man will be a king!
               There's a new world for the
               winning!
               There's a new world to be won!
               Do you hear the people sing?

     Marius enters the first floor to join them at last.                

                         MARIUS
               My place is here!
               I fight with you!


84   INT/EXT. RUE DE L'HOMME ARMEE/RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/CAFÉ     84     
     MUSAIN GROUND & 1ST FLOOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT                   

     Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout -                  

     Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole -                         

                         VALJEAN
               One day more!

                         COSETTE/MARIUS
               I did not live until today
               How can I live when we are
               parted?

     Eponine outside the café, gazing longingly towards Marius -

                         EPONINE
               One more day on my own...
                                                          85.


     Javert in the police station to his men -

                         JAVERT
               I will join these people's heroes
               I will follow where they go.
               I will learn their little
               secrets,
               I will know the things they know.

                         VALJEAN/JAVERT
               One day more!

                         MARIUS/COSETTE
               Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
               And yet with you my world has
               started.

                         JAVERT
               One more day to revolution
               We will nip it in the bud
               We'll be ready for these
               schoolboys -

                         THENARDIERS
               Watch'em run amuck
               Catch'em as they fall
               Never know your luck
               When there's a free-for-all!

                         VALJEAN
               Tomorrow we'll be far away.

                         VALJEAN/JAVERT
               Tomorrow is the judgement day.

                         ALL
               Tomorrow we'll discover
               What our God in heaven has in
               store -
               One more dawn!
               One more day!
               One day more!

     We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at         
     the first floor window with the students beyond them to see         
     that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the          
     street and have all joined in the final chorus.                     


85   EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY                                     85

     All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.
     The tramp of feet.

     All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the
     poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical
     students.
                                                     86.


Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.        

Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL
PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with
weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries
carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in      
front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a          
military tatoo.                                                  

INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,         
black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage         
draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a           
COFFIN.                                                          

Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin        
to sing.

                    CROWD
          Do you hear the people sing
          Singing the song of angry men?
          It is the music of a people
          Who will not be slaves again!

The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing
so subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming
from. The singing grows stronger.

                    CROWD
          When the beating of your heart
          Echoes the beating of the drums
          There is a life about to start
          When tomorrow comes!

The dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance
uneasily from side to side.                                      

                    CROWD                                        
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?                                                    
          Beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?

As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,     
Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing       
the carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and     
the procession.                                                  

                    ENJOLRAS                                     
          Then join in the fight
          That will give you the right
          To be free!

The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the       
coffin carriage.                                                 
                                                     87.


                    STUDENTS/CROWD
          Do you hear the people sing
          Singing the song of angry men?
          It is the music of a people
          Who will not be slaves again!
          When the beating of your heart
          Echoes the beating of the drums
          There is a life about to start
          When tomorrow comes!

Enjolras, Marius and Courfeyrac and other students climb       
onto the top of the carriage as the horses and led by          
Combeferre.                                                    

                    ENJOLRAS
          Will you give all you can give
          So that our banner may advance?

                    COURFEYRAC                                 
          Some will fall and some will live
          Will you stand up and take your
          chance?

                    ENJOLRAS/MARIUS/COURFEYRAC                 
          The blood of the martyrs
          Will water the meadows of France!

The crowd supports them and surround the coffin carriage,      
blocking the attempts of the police to intervene, singing
with passion.

                    STUDENTS/CROWD
          Do you hear the people sing
          Singing the song of angry men?
          It is the music of a people
          Who will not be slaves again!

          When the beating of your heart
          Echoes the beating of the drums
          There is a life about to start
          When tomorrow comes!

Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now
become the procession. They turn off the main street away      
from the expected course of the funeral procession.            
Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche      
and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.           

As the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop       
ahead and disappear round a corner.                            

                    STUDENTS/CROWD
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?
          Do you hear the people sing?

                                                          88.

                         STUDENTS/CROWD (cont'd)
               Say, do you hear the distant
               drums?
               It is the future that we bring
               When tomorrow comes!

     The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On   
     one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken       
     down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have        
     taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to        
     provide cover.                                                  

     There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one              
     nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged             
     kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin         
     carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,        
     grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.        

     More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral               
     explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the
     dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons
     of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women
     run screaming in terror.                                            

                         ENJOLRAS
               To the barricades!

                         STUDENTS/CROWD
               To the barricades! To arms! To
               arms!

     Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the              
     cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary              
     officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.                

     The students break away and race off through the cafe into          
     a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A          
     cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the                 
     students and falls through the window of an upended                 
     carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to           
     the slums.                                                          


86   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAY             86     

     FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.           
     They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens            
     including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF           
     who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a         
     gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their             
     husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution           
     on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to                  
     contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to         
     help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining            
     tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.          
     They set to work to build their barricade. Students                 
     commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the               
     barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street              
     hauling an uprooted tree.                                           
                                                     89.


They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front       
doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and     
raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every      
item of furniture despite the lamentations and                  
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.              

As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor     
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to      
prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on      
a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and      
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create           
protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade       
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The      
outside is a crazy knarled mess.                                

                    ENJOLRAS
          Here upon these stones
          We will build our barricade.
          In the heart of the city
          We claim as our own
          Each man to his duty
          And don't be afraid.

A man in worker's clothing is helping build the growing         
barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps      
his head down.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Wait!
          I will need a report
          On the strength of the foe.

The man who's just arrived looks up. It's Javert.

                    JAVERT
          I can find out the truth!
          I know their ways,
          Fought their wars,
          Served my time
          In the days
          Of my youth.

He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising.

                    PROUVAIRE
          See! The people unite!

                    GRANTAIRE
          Pray your right

                    COMBEFERRE
          Dogs will bark!

                    GAVROCHE
          Fleas will bite!

                    LESGLES
          They will do what is right.
                                                           90.


87    EXT. BARRICADE - DUSK                                      87

      The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to            
      twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can        
      be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades            
      protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras              
      climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his              
      little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame            
      Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing         
      armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing           
      she steals it back defiantly.                                      

                          ENJOLRAS
                Red, the blood of angry men!

                          ALL
                Black, the dark of ages past!
                Red, a world about to dawn!
                Black, the night that ends at
                last!


87A   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                     87A

      It is night. The students have been waiting for hours.

      A single flaming torch atop the barricade caged in by cobbles
      underlights a fluttering red flag.

      There is no sign yet of any opposition.

      A boy climbs down from sentry duty on the barricade. Marius        
      realizes its Eponine. She sits down with her back to him.          

                          MARIUS
                Hey, little boy, what's this I see?                      
                God Eponine the things you do!                           

                          EPONINE                                        
                I know this is no place for me,                          
                Still I would rather be with you!                        

                          MARIUS
                Get out before the trouble                               
                starts!                                                  
                Get out, `Ponine, you might get                          
                shot!                                                    

                          EPONINE
                I've got you worried now, I have!                        
                That shows you like me quite a                           
                lot...                                                   

                           MARIUS                                        
                Get Out!                                                 

      Joly, sentry on the main barricade, sees a figure approach.        
                                                        91.


                       JOLY
          He's back!

Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back
through the guarded `gate' into the barricaded street.

                    JAVERT
          Listen, my friends,
          I have done as I said.
          I have been to their lines,
          I have counted each man.
          I will tell what I can.
          Better be warned
          They have armies to spare
          And our danger is real -
          We will need all our cunning
          To bring them to heel.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Have faith!
          If you know what their movements
          are
          We'll spoil their game.
          There are ways that a people can
          fight -
          We shall overcome their power!

                    JAVERT
          I have overheard their plans.
          There will be no attack tonight.
          They intend to starve you out
          Before they start a proper fight -
          Concentrate their force,
          Hit us when it's light -

                       GAVROCHE
          Liar!

They all look up. There's Gavroche, on the top of the
barricade.

                    GAVROCHE
          Good evening, dear Inspector.
          Lovely evening, my dear!
          I know this man, my friends.
          His name's Inspector Javert!
          So don't believe a word he says
          Cause none of it's true.
          This only goes to show
          What little people can do.                            

Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in
defiance.

Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's       
delighted embrace.
                                                        92.


                     COURFEYRAC
           Bravo, little Gavroche!
           You're the top of the class!

Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own
head, mimicking the students.

                     PROUVAIRE
           So what are we going to do
           With this snake in the grass?


Enjolras faces Javert.

                     ENJOLRAS
           Tie this man and take him
           To the tavern in there!
           The people will decide your fate,
           Inspector Javert!

                     JAVERT
           Shoot me now or shoot me later -
           Every schoolboy to his sport!
           Death to each and every traitor!
           I renounce your people's court!

                     ENJOLRAS
           Take this man. Bring him through.
           There is work we have to do.

Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front       
door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his              
opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to          
subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied     
to the staircase.                                                 

                     ENJOLRAS                                     
           When are they coming!?                                 

Silence.                                                          

Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at
the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of
marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First
soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.
Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the
street.

Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.             

Silence.

They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all
they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These
are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection
from the torch.

A voice shouts out from the darkness.
                                                     93.


                    ARMY OFFICER
          Who's there?

At the same time we hear the clatter of guns being levelled.

                    ENJOLRAS
          French Revolution.

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Fire!

A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as
though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.

A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag
falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the
cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound
several men.

                    ENJOLRAS
              (as students return fire)                           
          Comrades, do not fire back! Do not                      
          waste powder!                                           

In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop      
reloading weapons.                                                

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up      
when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many                  
insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the     
top of the barricade.                                             

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Who's there? Get down!

                    MABEUF                                        
          Vive la France!

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Fire!

A second volley.

Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to   
the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from   
noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of
darkness to creep down the street.

All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the
rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over
the barricade. The students run for their guns and return
fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the
first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the
barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce
resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier
aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of
Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
                                                       94.


They are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is
fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost   
unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to
the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of
deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel.

                     MARIUS
          Clear out or I'll blow up the
          barricade!

Everyone freezes.

                    ARMY OFFICER
          Blow it up then and take yourself
          with it!

                    MARIUS
          And myself with it!

Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.

But already the soldiers have cleared out.

Marius comes down from the barricade.                             

                     FEUILLY                                      
              (to Marius)                                         
          Thank you!                                              

                    LESGLES                                       
          What were you thinking!                                 

As everyone surrounds Marius in amazement he spots Eponine
lying propped against the barricade.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine! What have you done?

He kneels by her side. Eponine is dying.

                    EPONINE
          Here... It's from Cosette...
          I kept it from you...

With a struggle she pulls the letter out of her pocket, and
pushes it into his hand.

                    EPONINE
          Don't be too hard on me...

Marius is shocked to find blood pouring from her wound.

                    MARIUS
          Eponine, you're hurt!
          You need some help!

Rain begins to fall.
                                               95.


                    EPONINE
          Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius -
          I don't feel any pain.
          A little fall of rain
          Can hardly hurt me now.
          You're here - that's all I need
          to know
          And you will keep me safe
          And you will keep me close
          And rain will make the flowers
          grow...

                     MARIUS
          But you will live, Eponine - Dear
          God above!
          If I could close your wounds with
          words of love -

                    EPONINE
          Just hold me now, and let it be.
          Shelter me... Comfort me...

                    MARIUS
          You will live a hundred years
          If I could show you how...
          I won't desert you now...

                    EPONINE
          The rain can't hurt me now...
          This rain will wash away what's
          past
          And you will keep me safe
          And you will keep me close
          I'll sleep in your embrace at
          last.

Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms.           

                    MARIUS
          Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine
          You won't feel any pain
          A little fall of rain
          Can hardly hurt you now
          I'm here.

                    EPONINE
          So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
          I don't feel any pain
          A little fall of rain
          Can hardly hurt me now...

                    MARIUS
          I will stay with you
          Till you are sleeping.

                    EPONINE
          That's all I need to know
          And you will keep me safe
                    (more)
                                                          96.

                          EPONINE (cont'd)
               And you will keep me close
               And rain..
               Will make the flowers...
               Grow...

     Eponine dies in Marius's arms.

     Marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears.

                          ENJOLRAS
               They were the first to fall.                              
               The first to fall upon this                               
               barricade.

                         MARIUS
               Her name was Eponine!
               Her life was cold and dark, yet
               she was unafraid!

                         COMBEFERRE
               We fight here in her name...

                         PROUVAIRE
               She will not die in vain...

                         LESGLES
               She will not be betrayed...

     They pick up Eponine's body and carry her into the tavern.

                         COURFEYRAC                                      
                   (to Gavroche)                                         
               Are you alright?                                          

                         GAVROCHE                                        
               That was my sister.                                       


88   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                       88

     Marius reads the letter Eponine has given him. He takes out
     pencil and paper and writes a note. Looking round, he sees
     Gavroche.

                         MARIUS
               Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de
               l'Homme Armé?

                         GAVROCHE
               Course I do!

                         MARIUS
               Will you take this for me?

     He holds out his note.
                                                          97.


89   INT. INN, RUE DE L'HOMME ARMEE, PARIS - NIGHT               89     

     The LANDLADY climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The          
     landlady indicates the door, and Gavroche knocks boldly.
     The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean.

                         GAVROCHE
               Letter for Cosette.

                         VALJEAN
               I'll take it.

     Gavroche holds out the letter with one hand, not quite
     giving it, the other hand open for a tip.

     Valjean gives him a coin, which he pockets as he hands over
     the letter.

                         GAVROCHE
               Something for you, something for
               me. Who needs charity?


90   INT. VALJEAN'S ROOM, LODGING HOUSE - NIGHT                  90     

     ON VALJEAN - As he reads the note.

                         VALJEAN
               `Dearest Cosette, you have
               entered my soul
               And soon you will be gone.
               Can it be only a day since we met
               And the world was reborn?
               If I should fall in the battle to
               come
               Let this be my goodbye.
               Now that I know you love me as
               well
               It is harder to die.
               I pray that God will bring me
               home
               To be with you.
               Pray for your Marius.
               He prays for you.'

     He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought
     of losing Cosette.

                         VALJEAN
               They haven't got a chance, these
               boys
               They almost certainly will die
               She'll be alone
               And she will need me all the more
               And we will go on as before                              
               When he is gone
               I dare not think like this
               I must find this boy
                                                          98.


91   EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT                                   91

     Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes,
     struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade
     being dismantled. And bodies.

     Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead
     soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.

     He continues on his way in the dark.

     Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time
     towards the very barricade where Marius waits.

     Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through
     their lines, and into the shadows.

     As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the          
     rooftops.


92   EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT                                       92

     Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching
     from the far end of the narrow street.

     The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the
     soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.
     Gavroche jumps up.

                         VALJEAN                                         
               Don't shoot!                                              

                         JOLY
               Here comes a man in uniform!
               What brings you to this place?

                         VALJEAN
               I come here as a volunteer.

                         JOLY
               Approach and show your face!

                         PROUVAIRE
               You wear an army uniform.

                         VALJEAN
               That's why they let me through.

     The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let
     Valjean enter.

                         JOLY
               You've got some years behind you,
               sir.

                         VALJEAN
               There's much that I can do.
                                                     99.


                    JOLY
          You see that prisoner over there?

He points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.

                    GRANTAIRE
          A volunteer like you!

                    COMBEFERRE
          A spy who calls himself Javert!

                    GRANTAIRE
          He's going to get it too!                              

Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared
look.

                    GAVROCHE                                     
          Don't shoot! I know him! He's no                       
          soldier!                                               

Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the     
roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at
Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them      
sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and
the snipers are driven back.

There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a   
brief fire fight ensues.                                        

The snipers have disappeared.                                    

Enjolras turns to Valjean.                                       

                    ENJOLRAS
          For your presence of mind,
          For the deed you have done,
          I will thank you, M'sieur,
          When our battle is won.

                    MARIUS
          Thank you, M'sieur.

                    VALJEAN
          Give me no thanks, M'sieur.
          There's something you can do.

                    ENJOLRAS
          If it is in my power.

                    VALJEAN
          Give me the spy Javert!
          Let me take care of him.

Javert hears this with grim satisfaction.
                                                    100.


                    JAVERT
          The law is inside out.
          The world is upside down.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Do what you have to do -
          The man belongs to you.

He turns to his little army.

                     ENJOLRAS
          The enemy may be regrouping!
          Hold yourselves in readiness!
          Come, my friends, back to your
          positions!
          The dawn is breaking fast.

Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He     
carries a knife.                                             

                    VALJEAN
          We meet again...

                    JAVERT
          You've hungered for this all your
          life.
          Take your revenge.
          How right you should kill with a
          knife.

Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.

                    VALJEAN
          You talk too much.
          Your life is safe in my hands.

                    JAVERT
          Don't understand...

                    VALJEAN
          Get out of here.

                    JAVERT
          Valjean, take care!
          I'm warning you.

                    VALJEAN
          Clear out of here!

                    JAVERT
          Once a thief, forever a thief.
          What you want, you always steal.
          You would trade your life for
          mine.
          Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!
          Shoot me now for all I care -
          If you let me go, beware!
          You'll still answer to Javert!
                                                    101.


                    VALJEAN
          You are wrong, and always have
          been wrong.
          I'm a man no worse than any man.
          You are free, and there are no
          conditions -
          No bargains or petitions.
          There's nothing that I blame you
          for.
          You've done your duty, nothing
          more.
          No doubt our paths will cross
          again.

He raises his gun and points it at Javert.

                    VALJEAN
          Go!

As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single
shot into the air.                                              

                    ENJOLRAS
          Courfeyrac, you take the watch -
          They may attack before it's
          light.
          Everybody keep the faith,
          For certain as our banner flies,
          We are not alone -
          The people too must rise!

Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the   
smaller barricades.                                             

                    ENJOLRAS                                    
          Marius, rest.

Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song and it is   
taken up more seriously by Feuilly. Bottles are passed round.   

                    GRANTAIRE                                   
          Drink with me to days gone by!                        

                    FEUILLY                                     
          Sing with me the songs we knew!

                    PROUVAIRE
          Here's to pretty girls
          Who went to our heads!

                    JOLY
          Here's to witty girls
          Who went to our beds!
                                                            102.


                         STUDENTS
               Here's to them -
                   (Marius sings to
                    Valjean)
               And here's to you!

                         GRANTAIRE
               Drink with me to days gone by!
               Can it be you fear to die?
               Will the world remember you when
               you fall?
               Can it be your death
               Means nothing at all?
               Is your life just one more lie?

     Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe.                    

                         ALL
               Drink with me
               To days gone by!
               To the life
               That used to be!
               At the shrine of friendship
               Never say die...
               Let the wine of friendship
               Never run dry!
               Here's to you
               And here's to me!

     Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius         
     through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath   
     it.                                                             

                         MARIUS
               Do I care if I should die
               Now she goes across the sea?
               Life without Cosette
               Means nothing at all..
               Please don't weep, Cosette,
               Should Marius fall.
               Will you weep, Cosette,
               For me?

     Valjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved.                    


93   EXT. BARRICADE/ INT. CAFE MUSAIN - NIGHT                      93     

     Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded
     street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.                 

     Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead                
     bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a               
     stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.           

                         VALJEAN
               God on high
               Hear my prayer
                         (more)
                                                            103.

                          VALJEAN (cont'd)
               In my need
               You have always been there.
               He is young
               He's afraid
               Let him rest
               Heaven blessed.
               Bring him home
               Bring him home
               Bring him home!
               He's like the son I might have
               known
               If God had granted me a son.
               The summers die
               One by one
               How soon they fly
               On and on
               And I am old
               And will be gone.
               Bring him peace
               Bring him joy
               He is young
               He is only a boy.
               You can take
               You can give
               Let him be
               Let him live,                                              
               If I die, let me die
               Let him live
               Bring him home
               Bring him home
               Bring him home!

     Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.                 

     CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
     street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets
     round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many
     that we know the little band can never win.

     CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
     entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the
     centre of the bright lights of Paris.


94   EXT. PARIS - DAWN                                             94

     The sun still below the rooftops. Every house is tightly
     shuttered.


95   INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAWN                                       95     

     Grantaire is fast asleep in the upstairs room, dead drunk.
                                                         104.


96   EXT. BARRICADE - DAWN                                      96

     Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate.
     He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No       
     one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a
     crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the
     students are up and getting ready.

                         ENJOLRAS
               The people have not stirred.

                         COURFEYRAC                                    
               Yet we will not abandon those                           
               Who still live in fear.

                         ENJOLRAS                                      
               The people have not heard,
               Yet we will not abandon those who
               cannot hear.
               Let us not waste lives!
               Let all who wish to                                     
               Go from here!

     There is silence. Uncertainty. Yet no one moves to go.            

                         GAVROCHE                                      
                   (from top of barricade)                             
               Do you hear the people sing                             

                         GAVROCHE/COURFEYRAC                           
               Singing the song of angry men                           

                         STUDENTS/CITIZENS                             
                   (joining)                                           
               It is the music of the people                           
               Who will not be slaves again                            
               When the beating of your heart                          
               Echoes the beating of the drums                         
               There is a life about to start                          
               When tomorrow comes!                                    

     Under this:                                                       
                                                                       

                         FEUILLY
               Enjolras! Ammunition's short.                           

                         MARIUS
               I will go into the streets.
               There are bodies all around.
               Ammunition to be had.
               Lots of bullets to be found.

                         ENJOLRAS
               I can't let you go.                                     
                                                    105.


                     VALJEAN
          Let me go!
          He's no more than a boy.
          I am old.
          I have nothing to fear.

Gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of
the smoke.

                    GAVROCHE
          I volunteer!

                    COURFEYRAC
          Come back, Gavroche! Don't you
          dare!

                    JOLY
          Someone pull him down right now!

                    GAVROCHE
          Look at me, I'm almost there!

                    GAVROCHE
          Little people know
          When little people fight
          We may look easy pickings
          But we've got some bite!
          So never kick a dog
          When he's just a pup -
          We'll fight like twenty armies
          And we won't give up!

The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up
Gavroche.

                    GAVROCHE
          So you'd better run for cover
          When the pup grows -

Crack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the
barricade.

                    COURFEYRAC
          No-o!

He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his
arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the
gate in the barricade.

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees
this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed
drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is
lining up the big guns carefully.
                                                      106.


                    ARMY OFFICER
          You at the barricades listen to
          this!
          The people of Paris sleep in
          their beds!
          You have no chance,
          No chance at all!
          Why throw your lives away?

Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.

                    ENJOLRAS
          Let us die facing our foes!
          Make them bleed while we can!

                    COMBEFERRE
          Make'em pay through the nose!

                    COURFEYRAC
          Make'em pay for every man!

                    ENJOLRAS
          Let others rise to take our place
          Until the earth is free!

The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.

And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake     
a massive barrage of musket fire.

The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst
right through in the first hit.

Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball
smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the
attackers.

Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the
barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles
down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.

Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting
down the dead, regardless of his own safety.

Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs
towards him -

CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade
and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of
student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café
Musain.
                                                          107.


97    INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                       97

      Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up
      the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the
      pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it
      to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -
      students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants
      of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.


98    EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                         98

      Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the
      onrush of the soldiers -


99    INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                       99

      The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling
      sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to
      clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the
      students are falling.


100   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                       100

      Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier
      challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the
      soldier flying -


101   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                      101

      The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find
      there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,
      knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the
      soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from
      his drunken slumber.

                          GRANTAIRE
                Long live the republic!

      He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.
      Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his
      now-ragged red flag.

      The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.
      Enjolras falls back -


102   EXT. BARRICADE - DAY                                        102

      Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he
      hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,
      streaming like blood down the wall.
                                                          108.


      PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the
      remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble
      for any last pockets of resistance.

      BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.
      INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of
      law over rebellion.


103   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                       103

      Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs
      between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -
      and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of
      soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.

      Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
      ground. A storm drain.

      ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
      end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.

                          SOLDIER
                Nothing here!

      The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.

      Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily
      fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.
      He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the
      grating has been lifted.

      He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for
      him.

      He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does
      the drain lead?


104   INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY                                     104

      Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping
      pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,
      then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint
      light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The
      skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.

      Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as
      he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an
      intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through
      distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he
      lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground
      to rest. He lets his eyes close.

      A voice echoes in the shadows.
                                                    109.


                    THENARDIER
          Here's a hint of gold
          Stuck into a tooth -
          Pardon me, m'sieur,
          You won't be needing it no more.
          Shouldn't be too hard to sell.

A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No
sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.

                    THENARDIER
          Well, someone's got to clean'em
          up, my friends,
          Before the little harvest
          Disappears into the mud.
          Someone's got to collect their
          odds and ends
          When the gutters run with blood.

Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on
Marius's finger and pulls it off.

                    THENARDIER
          Here's a tasty ring
          Pretty little thing
          Heart's no longer going
          And he's lived his little time,
          But his watch is ticking yet.

          It's a world where the dog eats
          the dog.
          Where they kill for the bones in
          the street.
          And God in his heaven,
          He don't interfere
          Cos he's dead as the stiff at my
          feet!
          I raise my eyes to see the
          heavens
          And only the moon looks down.
          The harvest moon shines down!

Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,
slams him against the sewer wall.

                    VALJEAN
          How do I get out of here?

                    THENARDIER
          There! That way!

Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.

Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the
wrong way.

LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and
they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.
                                                             110.


      As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his
      arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man
      above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-
      submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and
      suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is
      dropping -

      Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes
      burning with his refusal to be beaten.

      LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on
      his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the
      rushing sound of the river.

      Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.                           

      He drags himself on through the shallow running water
      towards the moonlight.                                                

      He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.


105   EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT                          105     

      Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer
      onto the embankment that runs beside the river.

      He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.

      Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once
      more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near
      the end of his strength.

                           VALJEAN
                It's you, Javert!
                I knew you wouldn't wait too
                long.
                The faithful servant at his post
                once more.
                This man's done no wrong.
                And he needs his family's care.

                          JAVERT
                I warned you I would not give in!
                I won't be swayed!

                          VALJEAN
                Another hour yet
                And then I'm yours
                And all our debts are paid.

                          JAVERT
                The man of mercy comes again
                And talks of justice!
                                                    111.


                    VALJEAN
          Come, time is running short -
          Look down, Javert!
          He's standing in his grave!

He starts to move past Javert.

Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.

                    JAVERT
          One more step and you die.

Valjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against
will.

                    VALJEAN
          Then I die.

He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it
holds the pistol.

Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but
he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he
lowers the gun.

                    JAVERT
          Take him, Valjean,
          Before I change my mind!
          I will be waiting...
          24601!

He turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He
stares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.

                    JAVERT
          Who is this man?
          What sort of devil is he?
          To have caught me in a trap
          And choose to let me go free?
          It was his hour at last
          To put a seal on my fate
          Wipe out the past
          And wash me clean off the slate!
          All it would take
          Was a flick of his knife
          Vengeance was his
          And he gave me back my life!

He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,
towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the
turmoil in his brain.

                     JAVERT
          Damned if I live in the debt of a
          thief!
          Damned if I yield at the end of
          the chase!
                     (more)
                                                    112.

                    JAVERT (cont'd)
          I am the law and the law is not
          mocked!
          I'll spit his pity right back in
          his face!
          There is nothing on earth that we
          share!
          It is either Valjean or Javert!
          How can I allow this man
          To hold dominion over me?
          This desperate man that I have
          hunted...
          He gave me my life! He gave me
          freedom!

          I should have perished by his
          hand
          It was his right...
          It was my right to die as well...
          Instead I live... But live in
          hell!

He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he
stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.
The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents
swirl round the piles of the bridge.

                    JAVERT
          And my thoughts fly apart
          Can this man be believed?
          Shall his sins be forgiven?
          Shall his crimes be reprieved?

          And must I now begin to doubt
          Who never doubted all those
          years?
          My heart is stone and still it
          trembles...
          The world I have known is lost in
          shadow
          Is he from heaven or from hell?
          And does he know
          That granting me my life today
          This man has killed me even so?

He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the
night sky.

                    JAVERT
          I am reaching but I fall
          And the stars are black and cold
          As I stare into the void
          Of a world that cannot hold...

          I'll escape now from that world
          From the world of Jean Valjean
          This is nowhere I can turn...
          There is no way to go on...
                                                             113.


      He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he
      wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,
      turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close
      over him. And he's lost.


106   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                         106

      Soldiers are dismantling the last of the barricade. Women
      move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among
      the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both
      the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's
      mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the
      slums for whom they died, united now in their grief.

                          WOMAN 1
                Did you see them
                Going off to fight?

                          WOMAN 2
                Children of the barricade
                Who didn't last the night.

                          WOMAN 3
                Did you see them
                Lying where they died?
                Someone used to cradle them
                And kiss them when they cried.

                          WOMAN 4
                Did you see them lying side by
                side?

                          WOMAN 5
                Who will wake them?

                          WOMAN 6
                No one ever will.

                          WOMAN 2
                No one ever told them that
                A summer day can kill.

                          WOMAN 7
                They were schoolboys
                Never held a gun
                Fighting for a new world that
                Would rise up like the sun.

                          WOMAN 3
                Where's that new world
                Now the fighting's done?

      The women move off to go about their day's business.
                                                             114.


107   INT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                       107

      CLOSE ON MARIUS - He's waking from the nightmare, finding
      himself in a fine bed, with clean linen. He looks round: a
      handsome room.

                          GILLENORMAND
                Marius! You've come back to us!

      Marius recognises the old man anxiously watching him: his
      grandfather, Monsieur GILLENORMAND.

                          MARIUS
                Grandfather...

      He struggles to rise, but he lacks the strength. His
      grandfather's face shows only love and concern.

                          GILLENORMAND
                Rest, Marius. No more harsh words
                between us. I just thank God
                you're alive.

      Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed. Tears form in
      Marius's eyes. Encouraged, the old man takes Marius's hand
      in his.

                          GILLENORMAND
                You've come home. To all of us.

      The distant voices of the mourning women -

                          WOMEN (O.S.)
                Round and round
                And back where you began...


108   INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                        108

      Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper
      room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room
      where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a
      chair.

                          MARIUS
                There's a grief that can't be
                spoken
                There's a pain goes on and on
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Now my friends are dead and gone.

      He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill.
      The blood of Enjolras.

                          MARIUS
                Here they talked of revolution
                Here it was they lit the flame
                Here they sang about tomorrow
                          (more)
                                                          115.

                          MARIUS (cont'd)
                And tomorrow never came...

                From the table in the corner
                They could see a world reborn
                And they rose with voices ringing
                And I can hear them now!
                The very words that they had sung
                Became their last communion
                On the lonely barricade at dawn.

      He looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade.
      He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke
      and the gunfire, the young men falling.

                           MARIUS
                Oh my friends, my friends,
                forgive me
                That I live and you are gone
                There's a grief that can't be
                spoken
                There's a pain goes on and on...

                Phantom faces at the window
                Phantom shadows on the floor
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Where my friends will meet no
                more.

                Oh my friends, my friends, don't
                ask me
                What your sacrifice was for
                Empty chairs at empty tables
                Where my friends will sing no
                more.

      Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway.
      There stands Cosette, waiting for him.


109   INT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                    109

      Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the
      house.

                          COSETTE
                Every day
                You walk with stronger step,
                You walk with longer step.
                The worst is over.

                          MARIUS
                Every day
                I wonder every day
                Who it was brought me here
                From the barricade.

      Cosette leads him into the room where Valjean and
      Gillenormand wait.
                                                          116.


                           COSETTE
                Don't think about it, Marius!
                With all the years ahead of us!
                I will never go away
                And we will be together
                Every day.
                Every day
                We'll remember that night
                And the vow that we made.

      As Valjean and Gillenormand look on, Marius and Cosette
      sing their love to each other.

                          COSETTE
                A heart full of love
                A night full of you
                The words are old
                But always true.

                          VALJEAN
                She was never mine to keep
                She is youthful, she is free...

                          MARIUS
                Cosette, Cosette!

                          COSETTE
                I saw you waiting and I knew -

                          GILLENORMAND
                Thank God, thank God you are here!
                Thank God, thank God you are home!

                          MARIUS
                Waiting for you!
                At your feet!

                          COSETTE
                At your call!

                           VALJEAN/GILLENORMAND
                Love is the garden of the young
                Let it be
                Let it be!
                A heart full of love
                This I give you this day.

                          MARIUS/COSETTE
                And it wasn't a dream
                Not a dream after all.


110   INT. PARLOUR, MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE - DAY                  110

      Marius stands before Valjean, alone in this more private
      room.
                                                    117.


                    MARIUS
          M'sieur, this is a day
          I never can forget.
          Is gratitude enough
          For giving me Cosette?
          Your home shall be with us
          And not a day shall pass
          But we will prove our love
          To you, whom we shall call
          A father to us both,
          A father to us all.

                     VALJEAN
          Not another word, my son.
          There's something now that must
          be done...

He's prepared himself to make this confession, but it's
still hard.

                    VALJEAN
          There lived a man whose name was
          Jean Valjean.
          He stole some bread to save his
          sister's son
          For nineteen winters served his
          time
          In sweat he washed away his
          crime.

Marius hears this with shock.

                     VALJEAN
          Years ago,
          He broke parole and lived a life
          apart...
          How could he tell Cosette and
          break her heart?
          It's for Cosette this must be
          faced:
          If he is caught, she is
          disgraced...
          The time has come to journey on,
          And from this day he must be
          gone!
          Who am I?
          Who am I?

                    MARIUS
          You're Jean Valjean!

Marius can't conceal that he's disturbed by this
revelation.
                                                             118.


                          MARIUS
                Monsieur, you cannot leave!
                Whatever I tell my beloved
                Cosette
                She will never believe me.

                          VALJEAN
                Make her believe
                I have gone on a journey
                A long way away.
                Tell her my heart was too full
                for farewells -
                It is better this way.
                Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette
                will never know...

                          MARIUS
                I give my word.

                          VALJEAN
                ...What I have spoken, why I must
                go.

                          MARIUS
                For the sake of Cosette, it must
                be so.


111   EXT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                       111     

      A waiting cab. Valjean comes out of the modest lodging
      house and gets in. The cab rattles away down the street.

      IN THE CAB - Valjean sits gazing far away at nothing. Then
      his weary eyes close.


112   INT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                       112

      Cosette gazes at Marius, bewildered by what she has just
      learned.

                          COSETTE
                Where's he gone without a word
                That wouldn't be his way to go

                          MARIUS
                All he asked for me to   say
                He's on a journey, far   away.
                Dear Cosette, he loves   you so
                Perhaps he will return   some day.

      Cosette comes into Marius's arms, tears in her eyes.

                          COSETTE
                He can't leave us now
                What's our wedding day
                Without him giving me away?

112A     EXT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                 112A

         Marius and Cosette, newly married, are walking towards
         Marius' house through an aisle created by wedding guests.
         Carriages line the street.

                             WEDDING GUESTS
                   Ring out the bells
                   Upon this day of days!
                   May all the angels
                   Of the Lord above
                   In jubilation
                   Sing their songs of praise!
                   And crown this blessed time
                   With peace and love!

114      INT. MARIUS'S FAMILY HOUSE, PARIS - DAY                     114

         Waltz music plays as Marius and Cosette lead the dancing at
         the wedding reception.

         As the dance proceeds, two extraordinary figures enter, and
         start helping themselves to the drink and the food. They
         are Thenardier and his wife, dressed up for high society.           

                             MAJORDOMO
                   The Baron and Baroness du Thenard

         They look round as the dance continues, highly satisfied with   
         themselves and see Marius.                                      

         Thenardier makes a mock-formal bow.                                 

                             THENARDIER                                      
                   I forget where we met...                                  
                   Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge                         
                   Where the Duke did that Puke                              
                   Down the Duchess's decolletage?                           

                             MARIUS                                          
                   No, `Baron du Thenard',                                   
                   The circles I move in are humbler                         
                   by far...                                                 
                   Go away, Thenardier!                                      
                   Do you think I don't know who you                         
                   are?                                                      

                             MADAME THENARDIER                               
                   He's not fooled!                                          
                   Told you so!                                              
                   Show M'Sieur what you've come here                        
                   to show.                                                  
                   Tell the boy what you know!                               
"LES MISERABLES" BLUE REVISIONS 20.5.2012          119A.


                      THENARDIER
            Pity to disturb you at a feast
            like this
            But 500 francs surely wouldn't
            come amiss.

                      MARIUS
            In God's name say what you have
            to say.

                       MADAME THENARDIER
                (to Thenardier)
            He speaks.                                             
                (to Marius)
            You pay!

                      THENARDIER                                   
            What I saw, clear as light,                            
            Jean Valjean in the sewers that                        
            night,                                                 
            Had this corpse on his back                            
            Some boy he'd killed in a viscious                     
            attack.                                                
            I was there, never fear!                               
            Even found me this fine souvenir!                      

  He shows off his ring. Marius stares in astonishment.            

                      MARIUS                                       
            I know this! This was mine!                            
            This is surely some heavenly sign!                     

  Thenardier steals the ring back.                                 

                      THENARDIER                                   
            And there's more! Mark this well -                     
            It was the night that the                              
            barricades fell.                                       

                      MARIUS                                       
            Then it's true! Then I'm right!                        
            Jean Valjean was my saviour that                       
            night!                                                 

  Thenardier looks past Marius to where Cosette stands among       
  their friends. He lowers his voice.                              

                      THENARDIER                                   
            Jean Valjean - the old con.                            
            You pay up and I'll say where he's                     
            gone.                                                  

  He takes out money and reluctantly presses it into               
  Thenardier's hands. Madame Thenardier takes the money before     
  Thenardier has safely pocketed it.

                      MARIUS                                      
            Not so loud! Here's for you.
            God forgive us the things that we
            do.

                      MADAME THENARDIER
            How's about some extra
            On a day so glad
            Our little orphan girl
            She hasn't done so bad.                               
            Raised in a convent
            Cash to spare -                                       
            We want our share.

  Marius hands over yet more money to Madame Thenardier.          

                      THENARDIER                                  
            Quite the little nun, ain't she!                      

  CRACK! Thenardier sinks to the ground, felled by a powerful     
  blow from an angered Marius. The band stops playing.            

                      MARIUS                                      
            Where is he?                                          

                      THENARDIER                                  
            (cowardly voice)                                      
            The convent.                                          

  Marius rushes to Cosette and we see him telling her where       
  Valjean is. They hurry away.                                    

  Thenardier clambers to his feet, helped by his wife. He         
  gestures to the band to continue. They stand by the tiered      
  wedding cake. As Thenardier recovers his composure, Madame      
  Thenardier steals one then two pillars from the cake so it      
  collapses on the floor. She then pushes it under the table      
  with her foot.

                      THENARDIER
            Ain't it a laugh?
            Ain't it a treat?
            Hob-nobbin' here
            Among the elite?
            Here comes a prince
            There goes a Jew
            This one's a queer
            But what can you do?                                   
                (pulling Madame Thenardier                         
                 onto the dance floor)                             
            Paris at my feet!
            Paris in the dust!
            And here's me breaking bread
            With the upper crust -

  As he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from     
  Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the           
  clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the        
  silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues.            
  Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove         
  these unwanted guests.                                           

                      THENARDIER                                   
            Beggar at the feast!                                   
            Master of the dance!
            Life is easy pickings
            If you grab your chance!

                      MADAME THENARDIER                            
            Everywhere you go

            But they're mostly broke!                              

                      MADAME THENARDIER                            
            Singing to the Lord on Sundays

                      THENARDIER                                   
            Praying for the gifts he'll send -

            But we're the ones who take it -
            We're the ones who make it in the
            end!

  The Thenardiers are carried off, singing as they go.

        IN ON A WINDOW - Where two candle burn.


116     INT. CONVENT CHAPEL, PARIS - NIGHT                       116

        Valjean prays in the chapel, on his knees. He's very weak.

        Next to the crucifix on the altar are Valjean's two silver
        candlesticks, in which two candles burn.

                            VALJEAN
                  Alone I wait in the shadows
                  I count the hours till I can
                  sleep.
                  I dreamed a dream Cosette stood
                  by
                  It made her weep
                  To know I die...
                  Alone at the end of the day
                  Upon this wedding night I pray
                  Take these children, my Lord, to
                  thy embrace
                  And show them grace...
                  God on high
                  Hear my prayer
                  Take me now
                  To thy care
                  Where you are
                  Let me be
                  Take me now
                  Take me there
                  Bring me home
                  Bring me home!

        VALJEAN is joined by the ghost of Fantine. She takes his hand
        as he prays.

                            FANTINE
                  M'sieur I bless your name...

                            VALJEAN
                  I am ready, Fantine...

                            FANTINE
                  M'sieur lay down your burden...
                                                           123.


                           VALJEAN                                         
                 At the end of my days...                                  

                           FANTINE                                         
                 You raised my child in love,                              

                           VALJEAN                                         
                 She's the best of my life...                              

                           FANTINE                                         
                 And you will be with God.                                 


116A   EXT. CONVENT CLOISTERS - NIGHT                             116A

       Cosette and Marius rush round the cloisters and enter the
       chapel in the middle of the cloisters.


116B   INT. CONVENT CHAPEL - NIGHT                                116B

       The sound of the door opening. Valjean looks round. It's
       Cosette entering, followed by Marius.

                              VALJEAN
                 Cosette?

       Tears form in his eyes. Cosette goes to him, kneels before
       him, takes him in her arms.

                           COSETTE
                 Papa, papa, I do not understand -
                 Are you all right? Why did you go
                 away?

                           VALJEAN
                 Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven
                 now?
                 Thank God, thank God, I've lived
                 to see this day!

       Marius comes to him.

                            MARIUS
                 It's you who must forgive a
                 thoughtless fool!
                 It's you who must forgive a
                 thankless man!
                 It's thanks to you that I am
                 living,
                 And again I lay down my life at
                 your feet.
                 Cosette, your father is a saint!
                 When they wounded me
                 He took me from the barricade,
                 Carried like a babe,
                 And brought me home to you!
                                                     124.


                    VALJEAN
          Now you are here
          Again beside me
          Now I can die in peace
          For now my life is blessed...

                    COSETTE
          You will live, papa
          You're going to live
          It's too soon
          Too soon to say goodbye.

                    VALJEAN
          Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to
          die!
          I'll obey
          I will try...

He holds out a letter for her.

                    VALJEAN
          On this page
          I write my last confession.
          Read it well
          When I at last am sleeping.
          It's the story
          Of one who turned from hating
          A man who only learned to love
          When you were in his keeping.

Cosette takes the letter and kisses it.

                    COSETTE
          I know it, papa.

Valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where
the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The
ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with
love, the ghost of Eponine.

Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.

                    VALJEAN
          I'm ready now, Fantine.

                    FANTINE
          Come with me
          Where chains will never bind you
          All your grief
          At last, at last behind you
          Lord in heaven
          Look down on him in mercy -

                    VALJEAN
          Forgive me all my trespasses
          And take me to your glory!
                                                           125.


      Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.

      Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine
      take them.

                          FANTINE/EPONINE
                Take my hand
                I'll lead you to salvation
                Take my love
                For love is everlasting...

                          VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP
                And remember
                The truth that once was spoken:
                To love another person
                Is to see the face of God...

      Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
      cloister.

      What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the
      man who has just died.

      The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
      The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now
      Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the
      wall of candles, all three are gone.

      As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high
      over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
      outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
      streets. Dawn is breaking.

      From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -


117   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY                             117

      THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the
      rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
      battle. Past the remains of a barricade.

      The distant sound of an approaching march.

      SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

                Sixteen years later
                Paris, 1848.

      From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march
      become the words of a song.

                          MARCHERS
                Do you hear the people sing
                Lost in the valley of the night?
                It is the music of a people
                Who are climbing to the light
                For the wretched of the earth
                          (more)
                                                    126.

                    MARCHERS (cont'd)
          There is a flame that never dies
          Even the darkest night will end
          And the sun will rise.

As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la
Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade.

SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:

          The people of Paris have risen in
          their tens of thousands.

          The King has fled. A new Republic
          is born.

There in the forefront of one column march Marius and
Cosette.

                    MARCHERS
          They will live again in freedom
          In the garden of the Lord
          They will walk behind the plough-
          share
          They will put away the sword
          The chain will be broken
          And all men will have their
          reward!

As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many
there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -

And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the
grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the
elephant, as the crowd fill the square.

                    MARCHERS
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?

As the marchers converge, there watching them are
Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a
wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.

                    MARCHERS
          Do you hear the people sing?
          Say, do you hear the distant
          drums?
                    (more)
                                                    127.

                    MARCHERS (cont'd)
          It is the future that they bring
          When tomorrow comes!

Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing
with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red
flags.

                    MARCHERS
          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?
          Do you hear the people sing?
          Say, do you hear the distant
          drums?
          It is the future that they bring
          When tomorrow comes...
          Tomorrow comes!

-----------------------------------------------------------

     (An ocean. Birds are flying and porpoises are swimming happily.
  From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves)

Sailors: I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
  And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho
  Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you
  In mysterious fathoms below.
Eric: Isn't this great?  The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face . . .
  a perfect day to be at sea!
Grimsby: (Leaning over side.) Oh yes . . . delightful . . . .
Sailor 1: A fine strong wind and a following sea.  King Triton must be in a
  friendly-type mood.
Eric: King Triton?
Sailor 2: Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad.  Thought every good sailor knew
  about him.
Grimsby: Merpeople!  Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
Sailor 2: But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth!  I'm tellin' you, down in the
  depths o' the ocean they live. (He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops
  away and lands back in the ocean, relieved.)
Sailors: Heave. ho. Heave, ho. In mysterious fathoms below. (Fish sighs and
  swims away.)

     (Titles. Various fish swimming. Merpeople converge on a great undersea
palace, filling concert hall inside. Fanfare ensues.)

Seahorse: Ahem . . . His royal highness, King Triton! (Triton enters
  dramatically to wild cheering.) And presenting the distinguished court
  composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! (Sebastion
  enters to mild applause.)
Triton: I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever con-
  ducted.  Your daughters - they will be spectacular!
Triton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel.
Sebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . .  [sotto] If only
  she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . . (He proceeds to podium
  and begins to direct orchestra.)
Triton's daughters: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton.
  Great father who loves us and named us well:
  Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.
  And then there is the youngest in her musical debut,
  Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,
  To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,
  She's our sister, Ar-i . . .
  (Shell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent.)
Triton: (Very angry.) Ariel!!

      (Cut to Ariel looking at sunken ship.)

Flounder: (From distance.) Ariel, wait for me . . .
Ariel: Flounder, hurry up!
Flounder: (Catching up.) You know I can't swim that fast.
Ariel: There it is.  Isn't it fantastic?
Flounder: Yeah . . . sure . . . it - it's great.  Now let's get outta here.
Ariel: You're not getting cold fins now, are you?
Flounder: Who, me?  No way.  It's just, it, err . . . it looks - damp in there.
  Yeah.  And I think I may be coming down with something.  Yeah, I got this
  cough. (Flounder coughs unconvincingly)
Ariel: All right.  I'm going inside.  You can just stay here and - watch for
  sharks. (She goes inside.)
Flounder: O.K.  Yeah - you go.  I'll stay and - what?  Sharks!  Ariel!
  (He tries to fit through porthole.) Ariel . . . I can't . . . I mean-
  Ariel help!
Ariel: (Laughs.) Oh, Flounder.
Flounder: (Wispering.)Ariel, do you really think there might be sharks around
  here? (Shark passes outside.)
Ariel: Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
Flounder: I'm not a guppy. (Gets pulled through porthole.)This is great - I
  mean, I really love this.  Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around
  every corn- YAAAAHHHHHHHH!! Ariel!! (He sees a skull, crashes into pillar
  causing cave in, and swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel.)
Ariel: Oh, are you okay?
Flounder: Yeah sure, no problem, I'm okay . . .
Ariel: Shhh . . . (Seeing a fork.) Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Have you ever
  seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Flounder: Wow, cool!  But, err, what is it?
Ariel: I don't know.  But I bet Scuttle will.
  (Puts fork in bag. Skark swims by outside.)
Flounder: What was that? Did you hear something?
Ariel: (Distracted by pipe.) Hmm, I wonder what this one is?
Flounder: Ariel . .
Ariel: Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen.
Flounder: (Seeing Shark looming behind him.) AAHHHH!! Run!! Run!! We're
  gonna die!! (Shark chases them all around. Ariel's bag is hung up. She
  goes back for it. Shark almost gets them. They head for porthole.) Oh No!!
  (They crash through and go round and round. Flounder gets knocked silly
  but Ariel saves him and traps Shark) You big bully. THBBBTTTT . . .
  (Shark snaps at him and he swims away.)
Ariel: (Laughing.) Flounder, you really are a guppy.
Flounder: I am not.

     (On surface. Scuttle on his island humming and looking through his
telescope.)

Ariel: Scuttle!
Scuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa!
   Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin' kid? (Lowers telescope to
   reveal Ariel at wing's length.) Whoa, what a swim!
Ariel: Scuttle - look what we found.
Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy.
Scuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this.
  Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.
Ariel: What?  What is it?
Scuttle: It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to
  straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an' a yank
  there and - voiolay!  You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration
  of hair that humans go nuts over!
Ariel: A dinglehopper!
Flounder: What about that one?
Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.  This is wonderful!
  A banded, bulbous - snarfblat.
Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh.
Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used
  to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they
  invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me.
  (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.)
Ariel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me!
Flounder: The concert was today?
Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter
  out of it or somethin'.
Ariel: Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.)
Scuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime.

     (Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic
projection of Ariel swimming.)

Ursula: Yeeeeeees, hurry home, princess.  We wouldn't want to miss old daddy's
  celebration, now, would we?  Huh!  Celebration indeed.  Bah!  In MY day, we
  had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace.  And now, look at me -
  wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically
  starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate.  Well, I'll give 'em
  something to celebrate soon enough.  Flotsam!  Jetsam!  I want you to keep an
  extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.  She may be the key
  to Triton's undoing. . . .

     (Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished.)

Triton: I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Ariel: Daddy, I'm sorry, I just forgot, I -
Triton: As a result of your careless behaviour -
Sebastian: Careless and reckless behaviour!
Triton: - the entire celebration was, er -
Sebastian: Well, it was ruined!  That's all.  Completely destroyed! This
  concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to
  you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!
Flounder: But it wasn't her fault! Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us
  - yeah - yeah!  And we tried to - but we couldn't - and - grrrrrrrrr - and -
  and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe. But then this seagull came,
  and it was this is this, and that is that, and -
Triton: Seagull?  What?  Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn't you?
  DIDN'T YOU?
Ariel: Nothing - happened. . . .
Triton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this?  You could've been
  seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!
Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians!
Triton: They're dangerous.  Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter
  snared by some fish-eater's hook?
Ariel: I'm sixteen years old - I'm not a child anymore -
Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady.  As long as you
  live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
Ariel: But if you would just listen -
Triton: Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the
  surface again.  Is that clear? (Ariel leaves, crying.)
Sebastian: Hm! Teenagers. . . .  They think they know everything.  You give
  them an inch, they swim all over you.
Triton: Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?
Sebastian: Definitely not.  Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was
  boss.  None of this "flitting to the surface" and other such nonsense.  No,
  sir - I'd keep her under tight control.
Triton: You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Of course.
Triton: Ariel needs constant supervision.
Sebastian: Constant.
Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.
Sebastian: All the time -
Triton: And YOU are just the crab to do it.

     (Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor.)

Sebastian: How do I get myself into these situations?  I should be writing
  symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. (Sees Ariel
  and Flounder sneaking off and follows.) Hmm? What is that girl up to? (He
  barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel's collection.) Huh?
Flounder: Ariel, are you okay?
Ariel: If only I could make him understand.  I just don't see things the way he
  does. I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be
  bad.

   Look at this stuff
   Isn't it neat?
   Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
   Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
   The girl who has ev'rything?
   Look at this trove
   Treasures untold
   How many wonders can one cavern hold?
   Lookin' around here you'd think
   Sure, she's got everything

   I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
   I've got whozits and whatzits galore
   (You want thingamabobs?
   I got twenty)
   But who cares?
   No big deal
   I want more

   I wanna be where the people are
   I wanna see
   Wanna see 'em dancin'
   Walkin' around on those
   (Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet
   Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
   Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
   Strollin' along down a
   (What's that word again?) street

   Up where they walk
   Up where they run
   Up where they stay all day in the sun
   Wanderin' free
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

   What would I give
   If I could live
   Outta these waters?
   What would I pay
   To spend a day
   Warm on the sand?
   Betcha on land
   They understand
   Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
   Bright young women
   Sick o' swimmin'
   Ready to stand

   And ready to know what the people know
   Ask 'em my questions
   And get some answers
   What's a fire and why does it
   (What's the word?) burn?

   When's it my turn?
   Wouldn't I love
   Love to explore that shore above?
   Out of the sea
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

  (Sebastion has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making
  a lot of noise.)
Ariel: Sebastion!?
Sebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad?  How could you - what is all this?
Ariel: It, err, it's just my - collection. . . .
Sebastian: Oh.  I see.  Your collection.  Hmmm.  IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS
  PLACE HE'D -
Flounder: You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Ariel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.
Sebastian: Ariel.  You're under a lot of pressure down here.  Come with me,
  I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink. (A ship passes by
  overhead.)
Ariel: What do you suppose?. . .
Sebastion: Ariel? Ariel!

     (On surface. Fireworks in the sky around ship. Ariel looks on,
amazed. Sebastion and Flounder arrive.)

Sebastion: Ariel, what - what are you- jumpin' jellyfish! Ariel, Ariel!
  Please come back! (Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds
  her.)
Eric: (Whistles.) Max, here boy. Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh
  Max? Good boy. (Ariel sees him and is stricken.)
Scuttle: Hey there, sweetie!  Quite a show, eh?
Ariel: Scuttle, be quiet!  They'll hear you.
Scuttle: Oooh, I gotcha, I gotcha.  We're being intrepidatious.  WE'RE OUT TO
  DISCOVER! (Ariel grabs his beak.)
Ariel: I've never seen a human this close before.  Oh - he's very handsome,
  isn't he?
Scuttle: (Looking at Max) I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.
Ariel: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat.
Grimsby: Silence!  Silence!  It is now my honour and privilege to present our
  esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday
  present.
Eric: Ah, Grimsby - y'old beanpole, you shouldn't have.
Grimsby: I know. Happy birthday, Eric! (Large, gaudy statue of Eric is
  revealed. Max growls.)
Eric: Gee, Grim.  It's, err, it's, err - it's really somethin'. . . .
Grimsby: Yes, I commissioned it myself.  Of course, I had hoped it would be a
  wedding present, but . . .
Eric: Come on, Grim, don't start.  Look, you're not still sore because I didn't
  fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you?
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.  The entire kingdom wants to see you
  happily settled down with the right girl.
Eric: Well, she's out there somewhere.  I just - I just haven't found her yet.
Grimsby: Well, perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Eric: Believe me, Grim, when I find her I'll know - without a doubt.  It'll
  just - bam! - hit me - like lightning. (Lightning and thunder appear and the
  sky grows dark.)
Sailor: Hurricane a'commin'!! Stand fast! Secure the riggin'! (Storm hits.)
Scuttle: Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here. (He is blown
  away.) Oh! Ariel . . . (Ship crashes through storm. Lightning starts a fire.
  A rock looms ahead.)
Eric: Look out! . . . (Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max.)
  Grim, hang on! (Sees Max.) Max! (Goes back to save him.) Jump Max! Come
  on boy, jump! You can do it Max. (He saves Max but is trapped on board.)
Grimsby: ERIC! (Ship explodes. Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him
  away.)

     (On beach. Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric.)

Ariel: Is he - dead?
Scuttle: (Opens Eric's eyelid.) It's hard to say. (Puts his ear against Eric's
  foot.)  Oh, I - I can't make out a heartbeat.
Ariel: No, look! He's breathing. He's so, beautiful.

   What would I give
   To live where you are?
   What would I pay
   To stay here beside you?
   What would I do to see you
   Smiling at me?

   Where would we walk?
   Where would we run?
   If we could stay all day in the sun?
   Just you and me
   And I could be
   Part of your world

  (Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene. Max and
  Grimsby approach. Ariel hurries away.)
Grimsby: Eric!  Oh, Eric.  You really delight in these sadistic strains on my
  blood pressure, don't you?
Eric: A girl - rescued me. . . .  She was - singing . . . she had the most -
  beautiful voice.
Grimsby: Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater.  Off we
  go.  Come on, Max.
Sebastian: We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened.  The sea king
  will never know.  You won't tell him, I won't tell him.  I will stay in one
  piece.
Ariel:
   I don't know when
   I don't know how
   But I know something's starting right now
   Watch and you'll see
   Some day I'll be
   Part of your world

     (Flotsam and Jetsam appear. Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber.)

Ursula: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't stand it - it's too easy.  The
  child is in love with a human.  And not just any human - a prince!  Her
  daddy'll LOVE that.  King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a
  charming addition to my little garden.

     (Fade to palace. Then sister's dressing room.)

Andrina: Ariel, dear, time to come out.  You've been in there all morning.
  (Ariel emerges, singing to herself.)
Atina: What is with her lately?
Ariel: Morning, Daddy.  (Ariel swims off.)
Atina: Oh, she's got it bad.
Triton: What? What has she got?
Andrina: Isn't it obvious, Daddy?  Ariel's in love.
Triton: Ariel?  In love?

     (Cut to Sebastion pacing on rock outside.)

Sebastian: O.K. So far, so good.  I don't think the king knows. But it will not
  be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
Ariel: (Picking petals off a flower) He loves me . . . hmmm, he loves me
  not. . . .  He loves me!  I knew it!
Sebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy.
Ariel: I gotta see him again - tonight!  Scuttle knows where he lives.
Sebastian: Ariel - please.  Will you get your head out of the clouds and back
  in the water where it belongs?
Ariel: I'll swim up to his castle.  Then Flounder will splash around to get his
  attention, and then with -
Sebastian: Down HERE is your home! Ariel - listen to me.  The human world -
  it's a mess.  Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.

   The seaweed is always greener
   In somebody else's lake
   You dream about going up there
   But that is a big mistake
   Just look at the world around you
   Right here on the ocean floor
   Such wonderful things surround you
   What more is you lookin' for?

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Darling it's better
   Down where it's wetter
   Take it from me
   Up on the shore they work all day
   Out in the sun they slave away
   While we devotin'
   Full time to floatin'
   Under the sea

   Down here all the fish is happy
   As off through the waves they roll
   The fish on the land ain't happy
   They sad 'cause they in their bowl
   But fish in the bowl is lucky
   They in for a worser fate
   One day when the boss get hungry
   Guess who's gon' be on the plate

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Nobody beat us
   Fry us and eat us
   In fricassee
   We what the land folks loves to cook
   Under the sea we off the hook
   We got no troubles
   Life is the bubbles
   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Since life is sweet here
   We got the beat here
   Naturally
   Even the sturgeon an' the ray
   They get the urge 'n' start to play
   We got the spirit
   You got to hear it
   Under the sea

   The newt play the flute
   The carp play the harp
   The plaice play the bass
   And they soundin' sharp
   The bass play the brass
   The chub play the tub
   The fluke is the duke of soul
   (Yeah)
   The ray he can play
   The lings on the strings
   The trout rockin' out
   The blackfish she sings
   The smelt and the sprat
   They know where it's at
   An' oh that blowfish blow

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   When the sardine
   Begin the beguine
   It's music to me
   What do they got? A lot of sand
   We got a hot crustacean band
   Each little clam here
   know how to jam here
   Under the sea
   Each little slug here
   Cuttin' a rug here
   Under the sea
   Each little snail here
   Know how to wail here
   That's why it's hotter
   Under the water
   Ya we in luck here
   Down in the muck here
   Under the sea

  (They discover that Ariel has left with Flounder.)
  Ariel? Ariel? Oh . . . somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Seahorse: Sebastian!  Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.  I've got
  an urgent message from the sea king.
Sebastian: The sea king?
Seahorse: He wants to see you right away - something about Ariel.
Sebastian: He knows!

     (In palace throne room. Triton looking at flower.)

Triton: Let's see, now. . . .  Oh, who could the lucky merman be? (Notices
  Sebastion.) Come in, Sebastion.
Sebastian: (Sotto) I mustn't overreact.  I must remain calm.  (Five octaves
  higher than normal) Yes - (loco) yes, Your Majesty.
Triton: Now, Sebastian, I'm concerned about Ariel.  Have you noticed she's been
  acting peculiar lately?
Sebastian: Peculiar?
Triton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself. . . .  You
  haven't noticed, hmm?
Sebastian: Oh - well, I -
Triton: Sebastian. . . .
Sebastian: Hmmm?
Triton: I know you've been keeping something from me. . . .
Sebastian: Keeping . . . something?
Triton: About Ariel?
Sebastian: Ariel . . . ?
Triton: In love?
Sebastian: I tried to stop her, sir.  She wouldn't listen.  I told her to stay
  away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they -
Triton: Humans?  WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?
Sebastian: Humans?  Ho ho ho ho. . . . Who said anything about humans?

     (Fade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave.)

Ariel: Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder: You'll see. It's a suprise.
Ariel: (Sees statue of Eric.) Oh, Flounder- Flounder you're the best! it looks
  just like him.  It even has his eyes.  "Why, Eric, run away with you?  This
  is all so - so sudden. . . . (Turns around and sees Triton.) Daddy! . . .
Triton: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I
  expect those rules to be obeyed.
Ariel: But Daddy!-
Triton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowing?
Ariel: Daddy, I had to-
Triton: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly for-
  bidden. Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that!
Ariel: He would have died-
Triton: One less human to worry about!
Ariel: You don't even know him.
Triton: Know him? I don't have to know him. They're all the same. Spineless,
  savage, harpooning, fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling-
Ariel: Daddy, I love him!
Triton: No . . . Have you lost your senses completely? He's a human, you're
  a mermaid!
Ariel: I don't care.
Triton: So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you. And if this is the
  only way, so be it. (Begins to blast the artifacts with his trident.)
Ariel: Daddy!. . . No . . . No, please- Daddy, stop!. . . Daddy, Nooo!!. . .
  (He blasts statue. Ariel begins crying and he leaves, ashamed.)
Sebastion: Ariel, I . . .
Ariel: (Still crying.) Just go away. (He leaves and Flotsan and Jetsam appear.)
Flotsam: Poor child.
Jetsam: Poor, sweet child.
Flotsam: She has a very serious problem
Jetsam: If only there were something we could do.
Flotsam: But there is something.
Ariel: Who - who are you?
Jetsam: Don't be scared.
Flotsam: We represent someone who can help you.
Jetsam: Someone who could make all your dreams come true.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Just imagine -
Jetsam: You and your prince -
Flotsam and Jetsam: Together, forever. . . .
Ariel: I don't understand.
Jetsam: Ursula has great powers
Ariel: The sea witch?  Why, that's - I couldn't possibly - no!  Get out of
 here!  Leave me alone!
Flotsam: Suit yourself.
Jetsam: It was only a suggestion.
  [Jetsam flicks the statue's broken face towards Ariel.]
Ariel: [Looking at the face] Wait.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Yeeeeeeeeeess?

     (Cut to outside of cave with Flounder and Sebastion.)

Flounder: (snif) Poor Ariel.
Sebastion: I didn't mean to tell, it was an accident. (Ariel passes by.)
  Ariel - where are you going?  Ariel, what are you doing here with this
  riff-raff?
riel: I'm going to see Ursula.
Sebastian: Ariel, no!  No, she's a demon, she's a monster!
Ariel: Why don't you go tell my father?  You're good at that.
Sebastion: But . . . But, I . . . (To Flounder.) Come on. (They travel towards
  Ursula's cavern.)
Flotsam and Jetsam: This way. (Ariel enters and is hung up in the garden of
  souls.)
Ursula: Come in.  Come in, my child.  We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude.
  One MIGHT question your upbringing. . . . Now, then.  You're here because
  you have a thing for this human.  This, er, prince fellow.  Not that I blame
  you - he is quite a catch, isn't he?  Well, angel fish, the solution to your
  problem is simple.  The only way to get what you want - is to become a human
  yourself.
Ariel: Can you DO that?
Ursula: My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To help
  unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

   I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
   They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
   But you'll find that nowadays
   I've mended all my ways
   Repented, seen the light and made a switch
   True? Yes

   And I fortunately know a little magic
   It's a talent that I always have possessed
   And here lately, please don't laugh
   I use it on behalf
   Of the miserable, lonely and depressed
   (Pathetic)

   Poor unfortunate souls
   In pain
   In need
   This one longing to be thinner
   That one wants to get the girl
   And do I help them?
   Yes, indeed
   Those poor unfortunate souls
   So sad
   So true
   They come flocking to my cauldron
   Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"
   And I help them?
   Yes, I do

   Now it's happened once or twice
   Someone couldn't pay the price
   And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
   Yes, I've had the odd complaint
   But on the whole I've been a saint
   To those poor unfortunate souls

  Now, here's the deal.  I will make you a potion that will turn you into
  a human for three days.  Got that?  Three days.  Now listen, this is import-
  ant.  Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol'
  princey to fall in love with you.  That is, he's got to kiss you.  Not just
  any kiss - the kiss of true love.  If he does kiss you before the sun sets on
  the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you
  turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.
Sebastion: No Ariel! (He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam.)
Ursula: Have we got a deal?
Ariel: If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
Ursula: That's right. . . .  But - you'll have your man.  Life's full of tough
  choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the
  subject of payment.  You can't get something for nothing, you know.
Ariel: But I don't have any -
Ursula: I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle.  You'll never even
  miss it.  What I want from you is . . . your voice.
Ariel: My voice?
Ursula: You've got it, sweetcakes.  No more talking, singing, zip.
Ariel: But without my voice, how can I -
Ursula: You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the
  importance of body language! Ha!

   The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
   They think a girl who gossips is a bore
   Yes, on land it's much preferred
   For ladies not to say a word
   And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

   Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
   True gentlemen avoid it when they can
   But they dote and swoon and fawn
   On a lady who's withdrawn
   It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man

   Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
   Go ahead!
   Make your choice!
   I'm a very busy woman
   And I haven't got all day
   It won't cost much
   Just your voice!
   You poor unfortunate soul
   It's sad
   But true
   If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
   You've got to pay the toll
   Take a gulp and take a breath
   And go ahead and sign the scroll!
   Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
   The boss is on a roll
   This poor unfortunate soul.

  (Ariel signs contract.)
   Paluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea.
   Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis,
   La voce to me!
  Now . . . sing!
Ariel: (Sings.)
Ursula: Keep singing! (Giant magical hands rip out Ariel's voice and give it to
  Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf-
  ace by Flounder and Sebastion.)

     (Fade to beach. Eric and Max are walking near castle.)

Eric: (Playing flute.) That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked
  everywhere, Max - where could she be? (On other side of rocks Ariel is
  washed up. Sebastion and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is
  amazed.)
Scuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!  Look at ya!  Look at ya!
  There's something different.  Don't tell me - I got it.  It's your hairdo,
  right?  You've been using the dinglehopper, right?  No?  No huh, well let me
  see.  New . . . seashells?  No new seashells.  I gotta admit I can't put my
  foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I'll -
Sebastian: SHE'S GOT LEGS, YOU IDIOT!  She traded her voice to the sea witch
  and got legs.  Jeez, man . . .
Scuttle: I knew that.
Flounder: Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in
  love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her. (Ariel tries to get
  up.)
Sebastion: And she's only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human
  legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe!  What would her father say?
  I'll tell you what her father'd say, he'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab,
  that's what her father'd say! I'm gonna march meself straight home right now
  and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him.) . . . and
  don't you shake your head at me, young lady.  Maybe there's still time. If
  we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with
  all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for
  the rest of your life.  All right, all right.  I'll try to help you find that
  prince.  Boy.  What a soft-shell I'm turning out to be.
Scuttle: Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing
  you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.

     (Cut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.)

Eric: Max? Huh . . . what, Max!
Scuttle: (Whistles.) Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational. (They hear Max.
  He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock.)
Eric: Max . . . Max - Quiet Max! What's gotten into you fella? (Sees Ariel.)
  Oh . . . Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss?  I'm sorry if this knucklehead
  scared you.  He's harmless, really - . . . you . . . seem very familiar . . .
  to me.  Have we met?  We have met?  I knew it!  You're the one - the one I've
  been looking for!  What's your name? (Ariel mouths "Ariel" but no words come
  out.) What's wrong?  What is it?  You can't speak? (Ariel shakes her head.)
  Oh.  Then you couldn't be who I thought. (Ariel and Max look frustrated. She
  tries pantomime.) What is it?  You're hurt?  No, No . . . You need help.
  (She falls into him.) Whoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy. Gee, you must
  have really been through something. Don't worry, I'll help you. Come on . . .
  Come on, you'll be okay.

     (Fade to Ariel in bath playing with bubbles.)

Carlotta: Washed up from a shipwreck.  Oh, the poor thing.  We'll have you
  feeling better in no time.  [Picks up Ariel's "dress"] I'll just - I'll just
  get this washed for you.

     (Cut to Sebastion in dress getting washed.)
Woman 1: Well you must have at least heard about this girl.
Woman 2: Well, Gretchen says . . . (Sebastion is dunked.) . . . since when has
  Gretchen got anything right. I mean really, this girl shows up in rags and
  doesn't speak-
Sebastion: Madame, please ! . . .
Woman 2: . . . not my idea of a princess. If Eric's looking for a girl, I know
  a couple of highly available ones right here . . . (Sebastion dives into
  kitchen and sees various fish cooking. He faints.)

     (Cut to castle dining room.)

Grimsby: Oh, Eric, be reasonable.  Nice young ladies just don't - swim around
  rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into
  oblivion, like some -
Eric: I'm tellin' you, Grim, she was REAL!  I'm gonna find that girl - and I'm
  gonna marry her.
Carlotta: Ha Ha. Come on honey. Don't be shy. (Ariel enteres in a beautiful
  dress.)
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Eric: You look - wonderful.
Grimsby: Come come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear. There
  we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It's - It's not ofen that we have such a lovely
  dinner guest, eh Eric? (Ariel starts combing hair with a fork. They look
  dumbfounded and she is embarrased. She sees pipe and brightens.) Uh, do you
  like it? It is rather - fine . . . (She blows its contents into his face.
  Eric laughs.)
Carlotta: Oh, my!
Eric: Ahem, so sorry Grim.
Carlotta: Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks.
Grimsby: (Wiping his face.) Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what's for
  dinner?
Carlotta: Oooh, you're gonna love it.  Chef's been fixing his specialty,
  stuffed crab.

     (Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook. He is humming to himself.)

Louis:
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   How I love les poissons
   Love to chop
   And to serve little fish
   First I cut off their heads
   Then I pull out the bones
   Ah mais oui
   Ca c'est toujours delish
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   Hee hee hee
   Hah hah hah
   With the cleaver I hack them in two
   I pull out what's inside
   And I serve it up fried
   God, I love little fishes
   Don't you?

   Here's something for tempting the palate
   Prepared in the classic technique
   First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
   Then you slash through the skin
   Give the belly a slice
   Then you rub some salt in
   'Cause that makes it taste nice
  Zut alors, I have missed one!

   Sacre bleu
   What is this?
   How on earth could I miss
   Such a sweet little succulent crab?
   Quel dommage
   What a loss
   Here we go in the sauce
   Now some flour, I think
   Just a dab
   Now I stuff you with bread
   It don't hurt 'cause you're dead
   And you're certainly lucky you are
   'Cause it's gonna be hot
   In my big silver pot
   Toodle loo mon poisson
   Au revoir!

  (Sebastion hops back and Louis grabs him again.) What is this? (Sebastion
  pinches his nose and a battle ensues. Louis knocks over a large cabinet.)

     (Cut to dining room. Huge crash is heard.)

Carlotta: I think I'd better go see what Louis is up to.

     (Back to kitchen. Louis is trashing the place.)

Louis: Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man!
Carlotta: Louis!  What are you doing?
Louis: Well - I - I was just - er, er, I'm sorry, madame.

     (Cut back to dining room.)

Grimsby: You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the
  sights of the kingdom.  Something in the way of a tour?
Eric: I'm sorry, Grim, what was that?
Grimsby: You can't spend all your time moping about, you need to get out.  Do
  something, have a life.  (Grimsby lifts his plate's cover to reveal Sebastian
  cowering in the salad.)  Get your mind off -
Eric: Easy, Grim, Easy.  (Ariel lifts her own plate cover and signals for
  Sebastian to hide there.  Sebastian rushes across while no one is looking.)
  It's not a bad idea.  If she's interested.  Well - whaddaya say?  Would you
  like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
  (Ariel nods vigorously, leaning heavily on her plate's cover.)
Grimsby: Wonderful, now let's eat, before this crab wanders off my plate.

     (Fade to Ariel watching Eric and Max from balcony.)

Eric: Come here boy! . . . Arrr . . . (He sees Ariel and waves. She is emb-
  arassed and goes back inside.)
Sebastian: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day
  of my life.  I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.
  Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.  Tomorrow, when he
  takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.  You gotta bat your eyes -
  like this.  You gotta pucker up your lips - like this. (He sees she is
  asleep.) Hm. You are hopeless child. You know dat? Completely hopeless . . .

     (Fade to undersea palace. Seahorse swims up to Triton.)

Triton: Any sign of them?
Seahorse: No, Your Majesty.  We've searched everywhere.  We've found no trace
  of your daughter - or Sebastian.
Triton: Well, keep looking.  Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.  Let
  no one in this kingdom sleep until she's safe at home.
Seahorse: Yes sire. (He leaves.)
Triton: Oh, what have I done? What have I done?

     (Morning at castle. Ariel and Eric leave for their tour. Ariel is amazed
by everything.)
Flounder: (As they pass water.) Has he kissed her yet?
Sebastion: Not yet.
Flounder: Ohh . . . (Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town.)
Scuttle: Yo, Flounder! Any kissing?
Flounder: No, not yet.
Scuttle: Hmm. Well they - they better get crackin'. (They leave town and Ariel
  drives, almost crashing. They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the even-
  ing.)
Flounder: Move over - move your big feathers.  I can't see a thing.
Scuttle: Nothing is happening. . . .  Only one day left, and that boy ain't
  puckered up once.  O.K.  All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic
  stimulation. Stand back. (He flies over and sings very badly.)
Eric: Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.
Sebastian: Jeez, man, I'm surrounded by amateurs!  You want something done,
  you've got to do it yourself.  First, we got to create the mood.
  Percussion. . . .  Strings. . . .  Winds. . . .  Words. . . .

   There you see her
   Sitting there across the way
   She don't got a lot to say
   But there's something about her
   And you don't know why
   But you're dying to try
   You wanna kiss the girl

Eric: Did you hear something?
Sebastion:
   Yes, you want her
   Look at her, you know you do
   Possible she wants you too
   There is one way to ask her
   It don't take a word
   Not a single word
   Go on and kiss the girl

   Sha la la la la la
   My oh my
   Look like the boy too shy
   Ain't gonna kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Ain't that sad?
   Ain't it a shame?
   Too bad, he gonna miss the girl

Eric: You know, I feel really bad not knowing your name.  Heh - maybe I could
  guess.  Is it, err, Mildred?  O.K., no.  How 'bout - Diana?  Rachel?
Sebastian: Ariel.  Her name is Ariel.
Eric: Ariel?  Ariel?  Well, that's kinda pretty.  O.K. - Ariel. . .
Sebastion:
   Now's your moment
   Floating in a blue lagoon
   Boy you better do it soon
   No time will be better
   She don't say a word
   And she won't say a word
   Until you kiss the girl

   Sha la la la la la
   Don't be scared
   You got the mood prepared
   Go on and kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Don't stop now
   Don't try to hide it how
   You want to kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la la
   Float along
   And listen to the song
   The song say kiss the girl
   Sha la la la la
   The music play
   Do what the music say
   You got to kiss the girl
   You've got to kiss the girl
   You wanna kiss the girl
   You've gotta kiss the girl
   Go on and kiss the girl

  (The boat tips over.)
Eric: Whoa, hang on - I've gottcha. (Flotsam and Jetsam congradulate each
  other.)

     (Cut to Ursula's cavern.)

Ursula: Nice work, boys.  That was a close one.  Too close.  The little tramp!
  Oh, she's better than I thought.  At this rate, he'll be kissing her by
  sunset for sure.  Well, it's time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles!
  Triton's daughter will be mine - and then I'll make him writhe.  I'll see him
  wriggle like a worm on a hook! (Laughing, she transforms into a human with
  Ariel's voice.)

     (Fade to castle at night. Eric is playing the flute and contemplating as
Grimsby approaches.)

Grimsby: Eric, if I may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh
  and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes. (He sees Ariel,
  sighs, and tosses away flute. He is distracted by Ursula/Vanessa singing with
  Ariel's voice and is placed under her spell.)

     (Scuttle flying toward castle in morning.)

Scuttle: Ariel!  Ariel, wake up!  Wake up!  I just heard the news.  Congratula-
  tions, kiddo, we did it!
Sebastian: What is this idiot babbling about?
Scuttle: Right - as if you two didn't know, uh?  The whole town's buzzin' about
  the prince gettin' himself hitched this afternoon!  You know, he's getting
  married!  You silly sidewalker!  I just wanted to wish you luck.  I'll catch
  you later, I wouldn't miss it! (Ariel brightens and runs downstairs, only to
  see Eric and Vanessa together.)
Grimsby: Well, uh - err, Eric.  I-it appears that I was mistaken.  This mystery
  maiden of yours does - in fact exist.  And - and she is lovely.  Congratula-
  tions, my dear.
Eric: We wish to be married as soon as possible.
Grimsby: Oh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time,
  you know. . . .
Eric: This afternoon, Grimsby.  The wedding ship departs at sunset.
Grimsby: Oh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish. (Ariel runs off crying.)

     (Cut to late afternoon as wedding ship starts to leave. Ariel on pier
crying bitterly as Sebastion and Flounder look on.)

     (Cut to Scuttle flying and humming to himself.)

Vanessa: What a lovely little bride I'll make, my dear I'll look divine
  Things are working out according to my ultimate design
  Soon I'll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine!
Scuttle: (Seeing real Ursula in mirror.) The sea witch! Oh no . . . She's-
  I gotta. . . (Runs into side of ship. Flies off to find Ariel.) Ariel!
  Ariel!  Ariel.  I was flying, I wa - of course I was flying - An' - I s- I
  saw that the watch - the witch was watchin' a mirror, and she was singin'
  with a stolen set o' pipes!  Do you hear what I'm tellin' you? THE PRINCE
  IS MARRYING THE SEA WITCH IN DISGUISE!
Sebastian: Are you sure about this?
Scuttle: Have I ever been wrong?  I mean when it's important!
Flounder: What are we gonna do!? (Ariel hears Ursula's voice in her head as the
  sun drops.)
Ursula: . . . Before the sun sets on the third day. . . . (Ariel jumps in water
  but can't swim well. Sebastion sends down some barrels.)
Sebastion: Ariel, grab on to that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as
  your fins can carry you!
Flounder: I'll try.
Sebastian: I've gotta get to the sea king.  He must know about this.
Scuttle: What - What about me?  What about ME?
Sebastian: You - find a way to STALL THAT WEDDING!
Scuttle: Stall the wedding. Wh- what am I - what - that's it! (He flies off to
  rally the animals and fish.) Move it, let's go, we got an emergency here!

     (Cut to wedding in progress. Max growls at Vanessa but she kicks him.)

Priest: Dearly beloved . . . (Flounder is pulling Ariel toward ship.)
Flounder: Don't worry Ariel. ugh - we - we're gonna make it. We're almost
  there.
Priest: Yes, um, do you Eric, take Vanessa, to be your lawfully wedded wife,
  for as long as you both shall live?
Eric: (Under spell.) I do.
Priest: Eh, and do you . . . (Birds and animals swoop in for attack, causing
  great chaos.) . . . then by the power inves-
Vanessa: Get away from me you slimy little- Oh, why you little- (In the
  struggle, the shell holding Ariel's voice it broken and it goes back to her.
  Eric comes out of the spell as she sings.)
Eric: Ariel?
Ariel: Eric.
Eric: You - you can talk.  You're the one.
Vanessa: Eric, get away from her!
Eric: It - it was you all the time.
Ariel: Oh, Eric, I - I wanted to tell you.
Vanessa: ERIC NO! (The sun sets and Ariel becomes a mermaid.)
Ursula: You're too late!  You're too late!  So long, loverboy.
Eric: Ariel! (Ursula and Ariel go overboard.)
Ursula: Poor little princess - it's not you I'm after.  I've a much bigger fish
  to -
Triton: Ursula, stop!
Ursula: Why, King Triton!  Ha ha ha - How ARE you?
Triton: Let her go.
Ursula: Not a chance, Triton!  She's mine now.  We made a deal.
Ariel: Daddy, I'm sorry!  I - I - I didn't mean to.  I didn't know -
  (Triton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident, to no
  avail.)
Ursula: You see? The contract's legal, binding and completely unbreakable -
  even for YOU. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.
  The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.  But - I
  might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better. . . .

     (Cut to Eric rowing away from ship.)

Grimsby: Eric! What are you doing?
Eric: Grim, I lost her once. I'm not going to lose her again.

     (Back to Ursula and Triton.)

Ursula: Now! Do we have a deal? (Triton signs contract.) Ha! It's done then.
  (Ariel is released and Triton is withered as Ursula laughs.)
Ariel: No . . . Oh, No!
Sebastion: Oh, your majesty . . .
Ariel: Daddy? . . .
Ursula: (Picks up crown.) At last, it's mine. Ho, Ho . . .
Ariel: You - You monster!
Ursula: Don't fool with me you little brat! Contract or no- AAAAHH! (She is hit
  with a harpoon thrown by Eric.) Why you little troll!
Ariel: Eric! Eric look out!
Ursula: After him! (Flotsam and Jetsam attack.)
Sebastion: Come on! . . .
Ursula: Say goodbye to your sweetheart. (Ariel makes her miss Eric and blast
  Flotsam and Jetsam.) Babies!  My poor, little poopsies!

     (On surface as Ursula grows beneath.)

Ariel: Eric, you've got to get away from here.
Eric: No, I won't leave you.
Ursula: (Now very large.) You pitiful, insignificant, fool!
Eric: Look out!
Ursula: Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!  The waves obey my every whim!
  The sea and all its spoils bow to my power! (She wrecks havoc, creates a
  whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks.)
Ariel: ERIC! (He gets on board one of the ships as Ariel falls to the bottom
  of the whirlpool. Ursula attempts to blast her.)
Ursula: (Laughing wickedly.) So much for true love! (As Ursula is about to
  finish Ariel, Eric steers the ship into her. She is impaled and dies most
  horribly. Eric collapses on the shore. The trident falls back to Triton and
  everything reverts to normal.)

     (Fade to morning with Eric on beach and Ariel watching from a distance.
Triton and Sebastion look on.)

Triton: She really does love him, doesn't she, Sebastian?
Sebastian: Well, it's like I always say, Your Majesty.  Children got to be free
  to lead their own lives.
Triton: You - always say that? (sighs) Then I guess there's just one problem
  left.
Sebastian: And what's that, Your Majesty?
Triton: How much I'm going to miss her. (He turns her into a human and she goes
  to meet Eric. They kiss which fades into kiss on wedding day. Everyone is
  happy. Sebastion is attacked by Louis. He beats Louis up and returns to the
  sea.)
Sebastion: Yes, Thank you, thank you. (Ariel and Triton hug.)
Ariel: I love you Daddy.

     (Big finale while "Part of Your World" music plays. Ship sails off as
Ariel and Eric kiss.)

All:     Now we can walk,
         Now we can run,
         Now we can stay all day in the sun.
         Just you and me,
         And I can be,
         Part of your world.

                THE END
